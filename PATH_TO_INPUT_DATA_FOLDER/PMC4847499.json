On admission to the hospital, the patient was intubated and he closed his eyes and demonstrated trace movements of all 4 extremities in response to painful stimuli. Skull X-ray showed multiple linear, depressed skull fractures of the vertex crossing the middle part of the superior sagittal sinus (). Brain CT revealed a huge epidural hemorrhage along both high frontoparietal lobes with mass effect and midline shift (). We considered fulminant sinus bleeding during the intraoperative period, but the hemorrhage from the injured sinus wall was stopped by simple digital pressure using Gelfoam. During the postoperative management, the patient fully recovered and he showed no neurological deficit.", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'5133588': 1, '28091809': 1, '1481760': 1, '15261501': 1, '28643041': 1, '5030509': 1, '882905': 1, '4176375': 1, '25767570': 1, '25584959': 1, '13097211': 1, '3559717': 1, '16029821': 1, '27169076': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4847499-1': 2, '4847499-2': 2, '4847499-3': 2}"}
