Five years earlier, the patient had been diagnosed with Posner\u2013Schlossman syndrome in another hospital. He had been treated with tobramycin/dexamethasone (TobraDex, Alcon, Belgium), but the treatment failed to control the disease. When the steroid dose was reduced, the patient's intraocular pressure increased, and corneal keratic precipitates appeared. In the past 2 years, he had used tobramycin/dexamethasone four times each day. One month earlier, he had noticed an abnormality in his right eye. An examination revealed ptosis (3 mm) of the right upper eyelid. The levator function of the right eye was 8 mm, which was weaker than that of the left eye (12 mm), as shown in Figure . The eyelid fold position was higher in the right eye. After excluding neurogenic etiologies, the patient was advised that he should reduce the frequency of the steroid treatment and that surgery could be performed when his ptosis was stable. However, because of the fear of recurrence of Posner\u2013Schlossman syndrome, the patient did not agree.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12195445': 1, '25325874': 1, '15069146': 1, '14819149': 1, '4996090': 1, '32060728': 1, '15987869': 1, '17220825': 1, '27256304': 1, '27434498': 1, '24379920': 1, '18425066': 1, '375893': 1, '16498434': 1, '21122943': 1, '29390490': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5758192-1': 2}"}
