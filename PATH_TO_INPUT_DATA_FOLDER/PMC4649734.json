Her height and body weight were 144 cm and 50 kg, respectively. She was positive for antinuclear antibody, and her IgG was elevated. A liver biopsy showed typical characteristics of autoimmune hepatitis (fig. ). We began corticosteroid therapy, and her liver tests improved; however, her positivity for IgA anti-HEV persisted 9 months after onset. Upon admission to our hospital, although HEV RNA was negative, we diagnosed her as having HEV infection according to the changes of titers of anti-HEV antibodies (fig. ). An updated (1999) scoring system for the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis [] indicated probable autoimmune hepatitis (score: 16) because viral hepatitis by HEV was not completely ruled out on this score system.", "age": "[[77.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18287603': 1, '15968741': 1, '15923136': 1, '23721425': 1, '8675163': 1, '16901555': 1, '25421241': 1, '15888974': 1, '24465537': 1, '25317081': 1, '22524475': 1, '20576022': 1, '32037983': 1, '10580593': 1, '25797216': 1, '15634950': 1, '20880057': 1, '33507492': 2, '1681163': 1, '11504536': 1, '25848463': 1, '30147981': 2, '11741279': 1, '26600768': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4649734-1': 2, '4649734-2': 2, '4649734-3': 2, '4649734-4': 2, '6083553-1': 1, '7921054-1': 1, '7921054-2': 1}"}
