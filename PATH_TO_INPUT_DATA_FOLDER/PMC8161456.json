According to a study written by the WHO, this patient would classify under the minimal common outcome measure as \u201cHospitalized with Moderate disease\u201d []. This measure of outcome attributes morbidity factors such as viral burden, age, symptoms, biomarkers, hospital stay length, and other aspects to categorize patients into brackets based on disease severity. It is thought that patient 2 obtained exposure during a visit from a family member, and 2 days afterwards experienced the main COVID-19 symptoms of cough, fever, myalgia, and headache []. He was diagnosed using RT-PCR testing and was confirmed positive two times over the course of his hospitalization. Several days afterwards, he reported that he was experiencing severe back pain located in the kidney region. It is worth noting that this symptom was prevalent in all family members exposed to him. Patient 2 received oxygenation due to mild ARDS and supportive therapy upon admittance to the ER, the standard protocol for such infection [] Upon admittance, our patient was continued on oxygen therapy for three days, and also received dexamethasone with Remdesivir because this was the promising therapeutic at the time. We propose that due to his pre-existing diabetic condition, which is known to cause cytokine imbalance, decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-B) likely contributed to an altered pathogenesis as compared to patient 1. We believe that this could have caused such an imbalance that the resulting clinical presentation was more severe. After hospitalization, the patient recovered after 7 days of hospitalization and reported positive cases of all people in his household. We hypothesize that in contrast to patient 1, this patient with DMII and a cytokine disbalance likely had an increased potential to spread the virus, which resulted in infections of those in his household.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26341401': 1, '33378609': 1, '33375410': 1, '32707573': 1, '32754312': 1, '32619697': 1, '17187316': 1, '19321428': 1, '33524311': 1, '32607448': 1, '33301246': 1, '32325252': 1, '32551464': 1, '32474009': 1, '32162702': 1, '32791213': 1, '32534226': 1, '32838064': 1, '33392485': 1, '34698149': 1, '32081428': 1, '32857487': 1, '32458279': 1, '31986264': 1, '15141377': 1, '32203188': 1, '32838135': 1, '32539990': 1, '33631066': 1, '15496474': 1, '32170560': 1, '32134278': 1, '32485618': 1, '33010835': 1, '10708457': 1, '12885899': 1, '33211672': 1, '32155444': 1, '19004938': 1, '34069418': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8161456-1': 2}"}
