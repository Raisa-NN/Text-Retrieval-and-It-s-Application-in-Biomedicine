The boy's medical history as well as that of his family was unremarkable with no reports of hepatic disease or endocrinopathy. A physical examination revealed multiple dermatomal arranged linear telangiectasias on his left chest wall and left arm (). In addition, a hard bony mass was noted on his left wrist and his left arm length was shorter than that of his right arm. Roentgenogaraphic examination of the left arm was performed and showed diffuse bony sclerotic changes in the distal humerus, ulna, carpal, and second to fourth metacarpal and phalangeal bones (). Bone scintigraphy showed abnormal uptake in the left humerus, radius, and hand bones (). Based on the roentgenographic and bone scintigraphy findings, the patient was diagnosed with melorheostosis.\\nA skin specimen obtained from the lesions on the left arm showed numerous dilated thin-walled, small-sized blood vessels in the papillary dermis (). Endothelial cells of the dilated blood vessels presented neither signs of vascular proliferation, nor pathologic findings of inflammatory cell infiltration. Based on the clinical features and histopathologic and radiographic findings, a diagnosis of UNT associated with ipsilateral melorheostosis was made.", "age": "[[9.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'6824361': 1, '7273476': 1, '33869990': 1, '20159330': 1, '507873': 1, '12360233': 1, '505048': 1, '14078566': 1, '8239703': 1, '22577274': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
