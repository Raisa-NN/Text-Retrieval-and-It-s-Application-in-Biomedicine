The detailed case history and the old records of the patient revealed that the patient developed an anaphylactic shock after being stung by a bee on her left fourth finger. She was admitted in the hospital within few hours. Next day onwards there was a decrease in all motor activities. A possibility of secondary Parkinsonism was considered and she responded to antiparkinsonism drugs (carbidopa + levodopa).\\nThe speech and language assessment of the patient revealed hypokinetic dysarthria. The main features of her dysarthric speech were inappropriate pitch, breathy voice, laboured speech, prosodic insufficiency, and rate disturbances. The overall intelligibility of her speech was poor. The patient was scheduled for twice a week therapy and the aim was to improve the overall intelligibility of the speech. The techniques like relaxation exercises to improve the breathing pattern and movement, pacing technique to control the rate of speech, and adduction exercises to increase vocal intensity were used. Measures during and after therapy documented significant improvement in the overall intelligibility of her speech within two months.", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9918354': 1, '10335030': 1, '9316687': 1, '8374916': 1, '596679': 1, '23091749': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
