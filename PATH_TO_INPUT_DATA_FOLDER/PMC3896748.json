She was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy with a weight of 3,230 g, a length of 52 cm and head circumference of 34.5 cm. The perinatal period was normal and her Apgar score was 9 at 5 min. She received formula from birth. Gluten was included for the first time at the age of seven months, without any adverse gastrointestinal effects. The target height of the girl was 163 cm (0.13 SDS). Both parents are healthy and unrelated, and had normal development during puberty.\\nFrom the age of six months, she showed a progressive reduction in growth rate, both for weight and height, and at the age of 14 months, she was evaluated at another centre and showed short stature (cm 69.9, -2.19 standard score deviation, SDS) (Figure \\n) with adequate weight (7,520 Kg, body mass index (BMI) -0.45 SDS), free thyroxin (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were within the normal range. Furthermore, serum anti-transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies were negative (IgA-tTG 1.7 IU/ml and IgG-tTG 7.2 IU/ml; normal values <7 IU/ml) with normal for age circulating IgA values (38 mg/100 ml; normal values: 37\u2013257 ng/ml). She exhibited iron deficiency anaemia, but the sweat test (Na+ 16 mEq/l and Cl- 13 mEq/l; normal values: Na+ and Cl- <40 mEq/l) and peripheral T and B cell assessment resulted normal. No abnormalities of the kidneys were detected by ultrasound and no gastrointestinal disorders were reported.\\nAt the moment of our evaluation, at the age of 4.1 years, physical examination revealed only basal dental enamel hypoplasia. She showed a height of 89.5 cm (-2.79 SDS) (Figure \\n), a weight of 12,5 Kg (BMI -0.76 SDS), a delayed bone age of 1.5 years, and a growth velocity during the last year of 4.83 cm/year (-1.79 SDS). Iron deficiency anaemia persisted despite cyclically repeated iron supplementation. The screening for CD was repeated and very high IgA -tTG (128 IU/ml) and IgG-tTG (77 IU/ml) values were observed. These data were highly suggestive of CD. HLA genotyping revealed DQA1*02:01, 05:05 and DQB1 *02:02, 03:01 haplotypes (i.e. HLA DQ2 haplotype). A duodenal biopsy revealed severe villous atrophy (Marsh 3c) with crypt hyperplasia and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (> 40 IELs/100 epithelial cells) confirming the diagnosis of CD. A gluten-free diet was started and after only four months her growth velocity increased from 4.83 cm/year (-1.79 SDS) to 6.53 cm/year (-0.15 SDS).\\nHLA genotyping in first-degree relatives revealed DQA1*05:01, 05:05 and DQB1*02:01, 03:01 in her older brother, who had a negative serology for CD. Therefore, his diet includes gluten and he repeats CD serology testing every three years.", "age": "[[4.1, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'7928444': 1, '12050583': 1, '19550380': 1, '12404215': 1, '18852634': 1, '11922565': 1, '19934769': 1, '8938902': 1, '29977983': 2, '9523165': 1, '16484124': 1, '17060123': 1, '12651074': 1, '28709446': 1, '22249805': 1, '22197856': 1, '24428915': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6024277-1': 1}"}
