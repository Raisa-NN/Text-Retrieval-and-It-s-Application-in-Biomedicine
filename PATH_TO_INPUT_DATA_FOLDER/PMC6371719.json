Bruxism and tongue bite were ruled out on questioning. He denied addictions such as chewing of betel nut/tobacco and smoking. No systemic complaints were reported. Despite lack of symptoms, the patient was anxious about the lesion being oral cancer. Intraoral examination revealed an oval nodular swelling of 1\u00d72cm size in the foliate papillae of the right posterolateral tongue. The pinkish-red nodule was firm, non-tender, and had subtle transverse grooves and superficial erosion over the surface []. Dental history was noncontributory and cervical lymphadenopathy was absent. Histopathology showed numerous oval and spindle-shaped cells in the lamina propria arranged as circumscribed nodules. Within the circumscribed neural plexus, the deepest portion showed small nerve fascicles and the superficial portion revealed linear bundles of spindle cells interspersed with thin fibrillary collagen fibers. Abundant lymphatic tissue with germinal centers was conspicuous [Figures and ].\\nWhat Is Your Diagnosis?\\nAnswer: Subgemmal Neurogenous Plaque (SNP)", "age": "[[28.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16872442': 1, '15297966': 1, '19913727': 1, '22738719': 1, '28488063': 1, '21960833': 1, '21887004': 2, '30886482': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3162863-1': 1}"}
