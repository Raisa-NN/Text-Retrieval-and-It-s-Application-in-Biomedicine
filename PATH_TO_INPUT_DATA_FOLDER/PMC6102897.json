Fifteen days after his rash, he noted weakness in his left hand dorsal stretch and grip. There was moderate weakness of muscles in left C6\u20138 myotomes and hypoesthesia over the thumb. The triceps muscle stretch reflex was absent. The electrophysiological examination revealed decreased amplitude radial CMAPs (4.1 mV) as compared to the contralateral side (11.1 mV) and decreased amplitudes median and radial nerve SNAPs. The needle EMG revealed many positive sharp waves in the left extensor digitorum communis, brachioradialis, abductor pollicis brevis and C7 paraspinal muscles. These findings were consistent with a left median and radial nerve lesions and nerve root lesion. Moreover, brachial plexus MRI showed hyperintensity of distal median and radial nerve. Though, there was no nerve enlargement or T2 hyperintensity of nerve roots. A half-year follow-up revealed that his muscle strength did not recover, and his muscles seemed atrophied. Also, he developed post-herpetic neuralgia.", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24638224': 1, '4673442': 1, '28364009': 1, '21482943': 1, '26829085': 1, '24334599': 1, '10943192': 1, '9270616': 1, '17848871': 1, '12235600': 1, '33145224': 2, '16003688': 1, '34141794': 2, '32664058': 2, '9344310': 1, '4313433': 1, '23999562': 1, '8891477': 1, '27663748': 1, '33766961': 1, '33489582': 2, '23886000': 1, '33814502': 1, '21887512': 1, '26436084': 2, '22715438': 1, '15824336': 1, '23628922': 1, '22499102': 1, '1711192': 1, '24665583': 1, '21339202': 1, '21321495': 1, '9101105': 1, '33150099': 2, '23648986': 1, '27313622': 2, '11293092': 1, '8609933': 1, '30131076': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6102897-1': 2, '6102897-2': 2, '7360310-1': 1, '7591216-1': 1, '7591216-2': 1, '7603882-1': 1, '4904081-1': 1, '7813428-1': 1, '4581133-1': 1, '8173409-1': 1}"}
