Extraorally there was a painful swelling in the submaxillary area which did not disappear when he opened his mouth.\\nThe histopathological examination showed a cyst with keratinization in the overlying epithelium, with the presence of a sebaceous gland in the wall ().\\nThe (ECHO) ultrasonic scan of the area () showed a sizeable infrasonic formation with distinct boundaries. The computed tomography (CT) showed a sizeable cystic formation with distinct boundaries (), while the scintiscan of the area with a Tc99m showed no evidence of the existence of ectopic thyroid tissue ().\\nThe clinical findings bore evidence of a cyst in the floor of the mouth with an infection which was surgically treated via intraoral approach, removing a 5.4 cm long cyst ().
