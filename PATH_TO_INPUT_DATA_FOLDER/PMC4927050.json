Then, in the delayed images, the uptake was almost same. In this case, early TDS was 7 and WOS was 0, but WOR was increased (21.8%). In LV functional analysis, LVEF, LVEDV and LVESV was normal, but E/A ratio was low. Moreover, ACE and BNP was elevated. Six month after initiating steroid therapy, the SPECT images were improved slightly (early TDS: 5), but WOS was 0 and WOR was improved (14.6%). LVEF, LVEDV and LVESV were not changed. E/A was normalized. ACE and BNP were also normalized.
