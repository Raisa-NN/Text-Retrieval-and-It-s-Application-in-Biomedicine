He also complained of dark urine and hematuria. He had no history of receiving prophylactic antimalarial drugs. He had previously been hospitalized in a small hospital with a diagnosis P. vivax infection and had received oral chloroquine therapy. Then the patient was referred to a specialized hospital in Mashhad city due to worsening symptoms. At admission, he had a temperature of 38.5\u00b0C and his other vital signs and consciousness level were normal. On physical examination, the patient had a tender abdomen and his spleen was palpable 5 cm below the left costal margin.\\nIn laboratory studies, hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL, hematocrit 34%, white blood cell count 16,000/mm3 , and platelet count was 45,000/mm 3 . His creatinine level was 1.9 mg/dL. Serum was assayed for total bilirubin (Bil), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), using commercially available kits. The serum level of Bil was 2.3 mg/dL, LDH 1680 U/L (normal level: 80 - 100 U/L), AST 106 U/L, and ALT 29 U/L. Peripheral blood smear examination showed severe infection with P. falciparum and 75 to 85% of RBCs contained one to five parasites per cell ().\\nPatient probably had a mixed infection with P. vivax and P. falciparum that the P. vivax infection had been treated with oral chloroquine, but chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum remained and parasitemia had increased.\\nThe patient was treated with intravenous quinine sulfate and oral primaquine. Then, he received primaquine (30 mg a day for 14 days) after the symptoms improvement for treating the probable mixed malaria infection. The improvement was considerable, so that parasitemia decreased by 40% after 24 hours and 1% after 4 days of posttreatment. During the treatment process, the patient developed dark urine and elevated creatine phosphokinase; thus, progression to acute renal failure was considered for him. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was exhibited in bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on the chest X-ray; also, he presented confusion due to cerebral malaria or superimposed a Gram-negative infection, so ceftriaxone was prescribed. However, patient was discharged after 10 days with no requirement for intubation, hemodialysis, or ICU admission. He had a good general condition at the last follow-up visit.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21063048': 1, '12930555': 1, '9713226': 1, '15654173': 1, '16495509': 1, '12689980': 1, '10841874': 1, '28540269': 1, '22454091': 1, '11258214': 1, '21570940': 1, '12701033': 1, '25147660': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
