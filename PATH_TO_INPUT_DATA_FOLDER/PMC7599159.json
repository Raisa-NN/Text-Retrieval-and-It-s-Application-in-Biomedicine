On 7 March 2016, Geleza\u2019s mother, Gaga, died during or following a between-group encounter, the noise of which seemed to have attracted feral/village dogs. Soon after the encounter, Gaga was seen dead with extensive wounds, likely from dog bites, but possibly also due to vervet monkey aggression during the between-group encounter. At the time of this event Gaga had an approximately 3-month-old infant, Geleza\u2019s younger sibling. The following day, Geleza was carrying the infant\u2019s dead body when observers arrived at the group at approximately 5:40 a.m. The group left the reserve (and thus were not followed) at 9 a.m. When they were next seen on the reserve, at 2:30 p.m. on the same day, Geleza was no longer carrying her dead sibling. It is unknown if the infant died before or after Geleza started carrying it, or if another monkey carried it after Gaga died; however, no other group member was observed carrying it.", "age": "[[3.5, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'32874665': 1, '20976285': 1, '31587157': 1, '21432869': 1, '16608690': 1, '30307263': 1, '30950189': 1, '27783254': 1, '32269818': 2, '31535228': 1, '24706453': 1, '30012747': 1, '28932999': 1, '32766938': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7137963-1': 1, '7137963-2': 1}"}
