The patient had presented similarly on her previous visits, was diagnosed with anaphylaxis and treated each time with the appropriate and standard of care and medication regimen, including epinephrine, diphenhydramine, famotidine, prednisone, and intravenous fluids. She was observed overnight and discharged with no obvious allergic trigger identified. On her third presentation, during which the diagnosis of lactation anaphylaxis was ultimately made, she was noted to have diffuse urticaria, respiratory distress, and wheezing. Additionally, the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 82/62 mmHg, consistent with a diagnosis of anaphylactic shock. She was again treated with the standard cocktail of medications, which led to the resolution of her symptoms; however, upon further questioning, it was revealed that she had been developing a rash with each episode of breastfeeding and that her profound symptoms requiring ED presentation had always developed following breastfeeding.\\nThe patient was observed for six hours with a presumed diagnosis of lactation anaphylaxis. Symptoms did not recur, and the patient was discharged with the recommendation to cease breastfeeding and switch to formula feeds. At three-month follow-up, the patient reported no further episodes of allergic reaction following the transition to formula feeding.", "age": "[[38.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18358585': 1, '19622944': 1, '25870661': 1, '21284652': 1, '26540396': 1, '31667033': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
