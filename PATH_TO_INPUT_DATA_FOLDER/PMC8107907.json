The prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times were normal. C-reactive protein (serum CRP) was elevated at 98.5 mg/dL (normal value: less than 0.8 mg/dL) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 45 mm/h. Blood biochemical analysis and urine analysis showed normal levels. The electrocardiogram and arterial blood gas were normal.\\nPreliminary imaging evaluation and X-ray and computed tomography (CT) showed a fracture of the distal right humerus, right olecranon and multiple segment (shaft and distal) fracture of the radius and ulna, lung contusions; fracture of the pubic rami (right), and mild traumatic brain concussion (Figure ).", "age": "[[37.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27738769': 1, '31738235': 1, '31791590': 1, '23352472': 1, '30533237': 2, '23237691': 1, '26068644': 1, '30762776': 1, '18453676': 1, '26738454': 1, '16508509': 1, '30915291': 2, '16075166': 1, '25549600': 1, '34002147': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6250006-1': 1, '6424312-1': 1}"}
