She had no hematuria, suprapubic pain, or family history of such problems. She had history of hysterectomy three years before this admission due to uterine leiomyoma. Physical examination revealed a mobile, round mass in bimanual examination. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a round mass measuring 4 \u00d7 5 cm (). There was no hydronephrosis in both kidneys. There was a round hyperdense intravesical mass near bladder neck in CT scan (). The mass was intramural in MR imaging and showed intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images (). A well defined 3 \u00d7 4 centimeter mass was seen in superolateral part of bladder neck during cystoscopy. There was no any involvement of ureteral orifices. Due to huge size of the mass and its proximity to ureteral orifice, trans-urethral bladder resection was not planned for patient.\\nShe underwent exploratory laparotomy with low midline incision. The mass was identified in the posterior aspect of the bladder wall so partial cystectomy was performed for her. The pathology of mass was epithelioid leiomyoma. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from hospital after 4 days.\\nThe patient's followup with clinical examination, abdominopelvic CT scan, and cystoscopy was normal in period of 2 years.", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12635765': 1, '1598742': 1, '16056215': 1, '9609649': 1, '16602281': 1, '8116123': 1, '17333443': 1, '3761457': 1, '13109927': 1, '22701194': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
