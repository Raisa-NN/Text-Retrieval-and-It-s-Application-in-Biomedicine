The lesion initially started in the instep of the left foot as an itchy papule, which later enlarged to form a painful verrucous plaque []. A year later, he noticed similar lesions in the lateral aspect of the same foot. On examination, multiple verrucous, oozy plaques were present on the inner dorsal and lateral aspect of left foot []. Size of foot lesions ranged from 2 \u00d7 2 cm to 7 \u00d7 3 cm. Linear lesions were present on the lateral aspect of the foot. Base of the lesion was not fixed to deeper structures and satellite papules were present around the plaques.\\nRoutine blood investigations and chest radiographs were within normal limits. Mantoux test measured 17 \u00d7 15 mm in size. Ten percent potassium hydroxide smear preparation was negative for fungus. Radiographs of the foot showed only soft-tissue swelling without bony involvement. Biopsy from the foot lesion was consistent with TBVC, with marked hypertrophy of the epidermis and mid-dermal granulomata with Langhans giant cells [Figures and ]. Patient was diagnosed as having TBVC. He was started on isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrizinamide, daily for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 4 months. Within three months, lesions flattened out [Figures and ] and at the end of 6 months all the lesions completely resolved.", "age": "[[17.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11288517': 1, '2196232': 1, '11144464': 1, '13239973': 1, '17664831': 1, '10671973': 1, '33520055': 1, '25387498': 1, '22761237': 1, '26180824': 1, '19295108': 1, '1873211': 1, '5665267': 1, '3073028': 1, '21772603': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
