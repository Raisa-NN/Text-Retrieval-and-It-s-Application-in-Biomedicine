According to the patient, 2 months before our consultation, there was a nasal discharge from the right nostril which stopped after ayurvedic treatment. The patient revealed that a mild pain was persistent even after taking analgesics. Right submandibular lymph nodes were palpable but nontender. Intraoral examination revealed a solitary ulcer of size approximately 1 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm in posterolateral region of soft palate extending from the distal aspect of the second premolar till tuberosity region []. Computed tomography scan revealed the presence of a tumor mass obliterating right maxillary sinus and eroding bone in tuberosity region [Figures and ]. The lesion was provisionally diagnosed with ADCC. The differential diagnosis included basaloid variant of oral squamous cell carcinoma and polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA).\\nAn incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. Histopathological examination revealed nests and sheets of small, darkly staining basaloid cells and identifiable small duct-like structures. Few cell groups revealed cribriform pattern composed of uniformly shaped basaloid tumor cells with scanty cytoplasm and angulated basophilic nucleus [Figures and ]. The overall clinicopathological correlation was suggestive of solid variant of ADCC.", "age": "[[68.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'6284339': 1, '15167050': 1, '18396442': 1, '23946749': 2, '25328314': 2, '21577319': 1, '22226227': 1, '24325947': 1, '29491609': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4196302-1': 1, '3731973-1': 1}"}
