Physical examination showed annular neoplasm in the subglottic portion, no obviously enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, and the neck ultrasound showed multiple thyroid nodules. Intraoperative frozen section showed LACC and nodular goiter. Therefore, total laryngectomy and bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy were performed. Clinical diagnosis is LACC (T2N0M0)\u2014nodular goiter. Immunohistochemical analysis of the specimen supported the diagnosis of LACC, and demonstrated positivity of CD117, P63, and CK7 (Fig. ), which suggested that the tumor consisted of glandular epithelium and myoepithelium. The diagnosis of the other 2 cases is arrived at similar immunohistochemical result. Postoperative pathological margin was negative, radiotherapy was accepted, and the radiotherapy dose was 60 Gy. The follow-up period was 2 years.
