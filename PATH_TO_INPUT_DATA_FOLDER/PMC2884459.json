Past medical history was remarkable for neurofibromatosis and polymyositis treated with 25 mg of prednisone daily; she underwent total transabdominal hysterectomy for fibromatosis 12 years before admittance. No complications were evidenced during laparoscopy, accomplished in the usual anti-Trendelembourg left flank decubitus with a peritoneal pressure of 13 mmHg. In third postoperative day, during the first passage of stools, she accused sharp hypogastric pain with the protrusion of 30 cm of ileal loops through the vagina. The surgeon on-call managed to replace manually the herniated intestine (which showed evidence of venous congestion) through a 5-cm defect in the vaginal cuff, and promptly indicated emergency laparotomy. Through a midline incision (over the previous hysterectomy scar), the bowel was checked for vitality and the vaginal cuff (showing signs of important seromucosal atrophy) repaired with single-layer absorbable interrupted suture after regularization of the impaired margins. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient discharged on eighth postoperative day.", "age": "[[64.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16154253': 1, '18796046': 1, '17849135': 1, '12172223': 1, '18682190': 1, '11334401': 1, '12798729': 1, '17478361': 1, '14990423': 1, '21486457': 2, '20606805': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3083337-1': 1}"}
