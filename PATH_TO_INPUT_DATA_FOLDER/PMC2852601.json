Colonoscopy revealed a red, hard, conic peduncular polyp, about 20 mm in diameter, in the ascending colon (). With conventional colonoscopy, the lesion did not show type III or IV pit pattern. Magnifying observation (EC-450ZH, Fujinon Toshiba ES Systems) revealed a red, slightly rugged surface consisting of an aggregation of smooth nodules (). We speculated that this polyp was nonneoplastic. It was suspected to be an inflammatory polyp (IMGP or IFP) from endoscopic findings. Excluding the polyp, there was no lesion in the colorectum. Endoscopic polypectomy was performed. Histological examination of the specimen revealed inflammatory granulation tissue in the lamina propria, proliferation of smooth muscle, and hyperplastic glands with cystic change.", "age": "[[78.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18720551': 1, '8024299': 1, '18648178': 1, '34815656': 2, '18785292': 1, '9563226': 1, '8314251': 1, '1309176': 1, '9513567': 1, '17431512': 1, '34746327': 1, '11464500': 1, '12664397': 1, '17659744': 1, '15955226': 1, '9564575': 1, '10405247': 1, '15334325': 1, '8186003': 1, '20396388': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2852601-1': 2, '2852601-2': 2, '2852601-3': 2, '8596221-1': 1}"}
