She had a large ICH (56 \u00d7 48 mm) in the left temporal lobe that reached deep brain structures (Fig. ). At admission, she was deeply unconscious (GCS = 3; WFNS = grade 5), with respiratory failure that required mechanical ventilation. Due to the large mass effect, she underwent surgery immediately after admission. The ICH was removed, and the left middle cerebral artery aneurysm was clipped. There was no improvement after surgery, and she died during the second day in the hospital.\\nThe aneurysm was diagnosed with computed tomography angiography (Fig. ) 2 months before the rupture. The patient was qualified for elective surgery at another center. The appointed date of surgery was 2.5 months after the UIA diagnosis. The indication for the neuroimaging studies was intermittent headaches that occurred over the past 1.5 years. The headaches were moderate, rarely severe, and localized on the left side of the head. There was no history of a previous SAH.", "age": "[[26.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'1566512': 1, '32339738': 1, '32244737': 1, '33349014': 1, '1771999': 1, '19376707': 1, '28656370': 1, '31597551': 1, '32666320': 1, '14970066': 1, '4711629': 1, '7914965': 1, '23574797': 1, '33148104': 1, '31288669': 1, '26089327': 1, '22133178': 1, '27527623': 1, '29799347': 1, '24290159': 1, '28465264': 1, '9445359': 1, '25757900': 1, '34350866': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8647099-1': 2}"}
