In spite of the conservative medication, the patient had no symptoms improved. On abdominal CT scans, there was a benign-looking, 5 cm-sized mass in the pancreatic tail. The impression was a microcystic serous cystadenoma or a pancreatic cancer, for which the EUS was performed. Then, the EUS showed that there was a well-circumscribed, homogeneous echogenic mass with a mostly solid containing calcification. This was followed by the FNA. Following this, the patient underwent spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy.", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30731300': 1, '24993459': 2, '17095844': 1, '15754366': 1, '12451561': 1, '6592923': 1, '26943434': 2, '17498591': 1, '18484644': 1, '12876017': 1, '18067066': 1, '33123945': 2, '10721808': 1, '9473097': 1, '16389690': 1, '14648429': 1, '24944486': 1, '17959228': 1, '12194139': 1, '1568614': 1, '15151205': 1, '24900144': 1, '24519038': 1, '15922212': 1, '1935510': 1, '24223249': 1, '17876886': 1, '24718662': 1, '23110037': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3479817-1': 2, '3479817-2': 2, '4090630-1': 1, '4623871-1': 1, '8397648-1': 1, '8397648-2': 1, '8397648-3': 1}"}
