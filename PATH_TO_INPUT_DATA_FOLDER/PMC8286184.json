There was no previous history of trauma or fever. On physical examination, bilateral hydrocele was present, and both swellings were nonreducible, transluminant, and fluctuant. Abdominal swelling was extending up to the umbilicus, and cross fluctuation was present with left side hydrocele, raising the possibility of left-sided ASH. The CECT abdomen revealed a large intercommunicating homogeneous hourglass-shaped fluid collection involving the lower abdomen and left scrotum (), confirming the diagnosis. The patient underwent uneventful, complete excision of the sac through the left inguinoscrotal approach ().", "age": "[[27.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26363104': 1, '8353121': 1, '1635142': 1, '1403520': 1, '16981097': 1, '8437091': 1, '27421822': 1, '34336353': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
