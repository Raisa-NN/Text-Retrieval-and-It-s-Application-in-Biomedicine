This patient refused the surgery. Microwave ablation was performed with a power of 40 W and a time of 5 min. The patient was followed up at 4 months after the procedure, and enhancement in the ablation zone was found, which was considered recurrence. We reconstructed her pre- and postablation CT and found that the minimal margin of the ablation zone was less than 5 mm (Fig. ).", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22968596': 1, '28111196': 1, '26273379': 1, '20729457': 1, '18372457': 1, '22037265': 1, '30143031': 1, '16863738': 1, '29392978': 1, '29852037': 1, '32300760': 1, '26728675': 1, '26096694': 1, '27554616': 1, '30207593': 1, '22564777': 1, '31537158': 1, '25321323': 1, '31243894': 1, '24927329': 1, '23154077': 1, '22104360': 1, '23436860': 1, '14514818': 1, '30620402': 1, '28449467': 1, '29366586': 1, '6632940': 1, '22012906': 1, '29555533': 1, '23356912': 1, '22722234': 1, '34098894': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8185913-1': 2}"}
