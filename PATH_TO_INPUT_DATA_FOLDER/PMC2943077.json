He presented with chest discomfort and poor exercise tolerance despite maximal medical therapy that had been getting worse over the preceding 6 months. As part of a work-up, an MRI viability study was performed which showed inducible ischemia in the anterior wall distribution. Cardiac catheterization showed a patent LIMA-LAD and a persistent 1st intercostal branch (). Percutaneous coil embolization was performed (). Immediately postprocedure he had minor and transient (<24 hours) chest discomfort. This was attributed to the embolization of the intercostal as his cardiac enzymes were negative and his ECG was unchanged. He was subsequently discharged. At a 1-month followup visit, the patient reported reduced angina and increased functional capacity, with corresponding diffuse global, nonspecific, improvement in endocardial perfusion.", "age": "[[69.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10333018': 1, '26981289': 2, '9930493': 1, '14696154': 1, '17664211': 1, '11383825': 1, '17045676': 1, '15245467': 1, '20871668': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4769740-1': 1}"}
