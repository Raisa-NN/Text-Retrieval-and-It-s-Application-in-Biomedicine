TTE showed highly mobile, large vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve and no vegetation on the aortic valve, mitral valve, and pulmonic valve. The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward for antibiotic therapy and received vancomycin and gentamycin. The blood culture of the patient became positive for staphylococcus areus 3 times in 24-hour intervals. Despite the antibiotic therapy for 10 days, the patient remained febrile and developed severe dyspnea. TEE revealed severe aortic insufficiency, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and an echo-lucent space between the tricuspid and aortic valves ().\\nColor Doppler demonstrated a flow within the echo-lucent space and a connection between that and the left ventricle, suggesting a perivalvular abscess of the tricuspid valve opening in the left ventricle (). After consultation with a cardiac surgeon, the patient was transferred to the operating room, where he unfortunately expired due to severe bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulation.", "age": "[[21.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15956145': 1, '9860802': 1, '14726169': 1, '10082156': 1, '23074577': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
