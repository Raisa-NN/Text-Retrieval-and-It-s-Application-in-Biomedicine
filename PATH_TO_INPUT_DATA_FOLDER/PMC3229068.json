The lesions were increasing in size and she found the appearance embarrassing. There was no family history of the condition. On examination, she had multiple, small, scaly lesions with a raised hyperkeratotic ridge on her legs, arms and face. A punch biopsy taken from a representative lesion on the face showed a keratin-filled epidermal invagination with a characteristic cornoid lamella, and confirmed the diagnosis of DSAP. Subsequently, treatment with MAL-PDT was performed on the face (she was given 4 treatments). The 2nd and 3rd MAL-PDT treatment was given after an interval of 3 weeks and a 4th MAL-PDT after 4 months. The treatment protocol was the same as in case 1. A majority of the lesions disappeared after 3 sessions of MAL-PDT () and the 4th session was performed to remove the few remaining lesions. The patient complained of diffuse scaling of the face and aggravation of the underlying melasma after MAL-PDT treatment (). The pigmentation was prominent at her follow-up visit which was made 1 week after the 1st MAL-PDT and gradually faded with time, lasting for about a month.", "age": "[[62.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15545557': 1, '12472551': 1, '28239750': 1, '18429984': 1, '2721409': 1, '20404225': 1, '16854765': 1, '22148053': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3229068-1': 2}"}
