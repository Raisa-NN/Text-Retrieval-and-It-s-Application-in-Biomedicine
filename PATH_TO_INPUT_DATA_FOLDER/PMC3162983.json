His comorbidities included atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopathy, hyperthyroidism, and bilateral total knee replacement. He underwent emergent off-pump coronary artery bypass with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and saphenous vein grafts (SVGs). Due to his preexisting platelet dysfunction, he required aggressive substitution of platelets and clotting factors. He underwent rethoracotomy on postoperative day number 2 for evacuation of a mediastinal hematoma. During the course of these events, he also developed an extensive saphenous vein site hematoma, which could be treated conservatively with pressure dressings. After adequate recovery, he was transferred to the normal wards, where he made good progress with mobilization. Unfortunately, he developed a wound complication in the region of the saphenectomy. This was not amenable to conservative therapy, so a graded approach to further treatment was employed ().", "age": "[[68.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'5647919': 1, '19942633': 1, '19214418': 1, '17041688': 1, '19696051': 1, '21876703': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
