She did not have any pain, fever or weight loss. She had a history of snake bite by a Malayan pit viper to her left leg when she was 14 years old. Her leg became markedly swollen and she could not walk for 2 months. She was treated by a traditional healer. Finally, she could walk again but her ankle and toes could not perform active dorsiflexion. At the first visit, a physical examination showed a 20\u00d710cm mass in her left leg. The mass was not tender or inflamed. Sensation was decreased over the dorsum of her left foot.A plain X-ray showed a large soft tissue mass at the anterior compartment of her left leg. Cortical erosion of her tibia was observed. A sheet-like mass with an enlarged central cavity combined with peripheral calcification resembling an eggshell and multiple fragmented calcifications in her left leg were detected (Figure \\n).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large well-defined heterogeneous iso- to hyperintense soft tissue lesion with hypointense coarse calcifications on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images with heterogeneous enhancement after gadolinium contrast administration that mainly involved the anterior compartment of her left leg with evidence of tibial cortical atrophy from the pressure effect (Figure \\na, b, c).The patient decided to observe the clinical signs and symptoms. One year later the mass progressed in size (Figure \\n). A repeated MRI showed soft tissue mass involving the entire anterior compartment of her left leg and increased extension to the tibialis posterior muscle of the posterior compartment. Progressive cortical erosion of tibia and fibula was found (Figure \\na, b).A biopsy was done which found central necrotic tissue with peripheral calcification and a negative result for neoplastic cells. Mass excision was suggested to the patient but she refused to have an operation and decided to continue observation. After that she missed a follow-up appointment and was lost to follow-up. Four years later she returned to our hospital and again presented with a larger mass and an infected open wound at the anterolateral part of her leg (Figures \\n and\\n). During the 4 years after she missed the appointment the mass gradually enlarged but she had no pain or any sign of infection in the first 3.5 years. After that the skin broke and she received treatment of antibiotics and wound care from a nearby community hospital but her wound did not improve.\\nFinally, surgery was performed for mass resection and primary closure with a vacuum drainage. Multiple microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii and Proteus vulgaris) were found in an intraoperative culture.A pathological study of the excised mass revealed tissue necrosis with hemorrhage and diffused calcification and a negative result for neoplastic cells (Figure \\n).The vacuum drainage was removed on postoperative day 12. She received intravenous cefazolin and gentamicin for 2 weeks and then took ciprofloxacin tablets for 6 weeks. The wound was completely healed at 1 month postoperation. There was no wound complication or disease recurrence at 1-year postoperation (Figure \\n).", "age": "[[66.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16794141': 1, '12525942': 1, '7473980': 1, '31466356': 2, '15935533': 1, '11501809': 1, '22119606': 1, '8470578': 1, '22454093': 1, '21510773': 1, '29731908': 1, '14991247': 1, '7671519': 1, '16205923': 1, '33936914': 1, '13826150': 1, '23541092': 1, '19736609': 2, '24934373': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2852764-1': 1, '6780786-1': 1}"}
