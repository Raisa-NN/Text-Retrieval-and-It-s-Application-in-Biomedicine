At initial examination, patient had a Glasgow:12, with motor deficit and aphasia. Computed tomography (CT) scan was performed: it showed a 3-cm-diameter mass lesion with edema, enhancement with contrast and midline deviation of 5 mm. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed, showing an extended lesion with infiltration of the pre/pos central gyri, the posterior limb of the internal capsule with a heterogenic surface, small cysts and apparent necrosis inside (). After examination patient was diagnosed with GBM and surgery was performed.\\nAfter surgery, the patient had a worsening of the motor deficit, remaining with the motor aphasia and therefore underwent another CT scan ().
