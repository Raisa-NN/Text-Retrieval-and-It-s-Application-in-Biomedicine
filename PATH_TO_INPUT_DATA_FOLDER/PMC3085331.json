Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of the right diaphragmatic dome (). Abdominal ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic and heterogeneous mass, measuring 8 cm in diameter, localized in the hepatic dome (). At his admission, the physical examination was normal. White blood cell count was 7500; c-reactive protein was normal too. Hepatic function test and tumor markers were within normal range (AFP and CEA).\\nAbdominal tomography revealed a subcapsular lesion occupying segments VII and VIII and measuring 4 cm in diameter spontaneously hypodense and having slight peripheral enhancement at delayed stage ().\\nA second tomography done one month later described the same lesion with the same characteristics but with a dramatic decrease in size which is evaluated to be 2 cm in diameter (). This spontaneous regression in size associated with radiological characteristics of a partially fibrous lesion permitted us to make the diagnosis of IPL and to abstain from any therapeutics. The patient is doing well and another radiologic control is foreseen in 6 months.", "age": "[[15.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'2155699': 1, '17652982': 1, '14631302': 1, '18031372': 1, '14562196': 1, '25309095': 1, '26412330': 1, '17522777': 1, '26229415': 1, '16268428': 1, '18049174': 1, '7720466': 1, '1734701': 1, '12595051': 1, '21541218': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
