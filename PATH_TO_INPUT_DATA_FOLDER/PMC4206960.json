Neurological examination revealed hypesthesia of the left leg and no motor deficit, with normal deep tendon reflexes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an extradural mass, 1.8 cm in size, with rim enhancement in the spinal canal at the T12 level (). The mass extended to the midline and the left T12-L1 foramen. Computed tomography (CT) revealed dense calcification within the mass (). A T12 total laminectomy was performed with the patient in the prone position. The epidural mass was identified around the left T12 nerve root (). A linear durotomy was performed at the midline, and the intradural portion was removed using an ultrasonic surgical aspirator and a Kerrison punch (). The adjacent dura was severely ossified, and the left T12 nerve root sleeve was thickened. The extradural portion was not separable from the adjacent dura and the left T12 root, and it was removed by dural excision using a #15 blade and Edson forceps (). The left T12 nerve root was sacrificed (). The dural margin was coagulated using a bipolar coagulator, and the dural defect was repaired with artificial dura (). Pathological examination of the tumor confirmed the diagnosis of psammomatous meningioma (). The Ki-67 labeling index of the tumor was less than 1%.", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16542842': 1, '8474655': 1, '7143063': 1, '2671779': 1, '2585075': 1, '5351521': 1, '30627240': 1, '31362237': 1, '22181328': 1, '9225329': 1, '22146282': 1, '22405399': 1, '24045159': 1, '27437022': 2, '25346770': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4949176-1': 1}"}
