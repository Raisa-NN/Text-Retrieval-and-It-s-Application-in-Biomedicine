The initial radiology workup showed no signs of extrahepatic tumors. AFP was 167,000 \u03bcg/L (reference <10 \u03bcg/L) and CA19-9 48 kU/L (reference <30 kU/L). A radical extended resection of the left lobe and segments V and VII was performed in February 2016. The resected tumor included a major lesion with the largest diameter of 27 cm and two satellite lesions sized 25 and 30 mm, respectively. The resection surface was free of cancer.\\nHistology demonstrated a poorly differentiated CHC. There were no tumor areas with ordinary hepatocytes or cholangiocytes, rather all cells had mixed features of both HCC with trabecular growth and CCC with tendency for glandular formation. There was also a vascular invasion. Lymph nodes (two) were free of cancer.\\nImmunohistochemical staining of the primary liver tumor showed positive responses for Arginase 1, AFP and Glypican 3, Cytokeratin 7 and 19, MUC1, and carbonic anhydrase, and Ki-67 in 20%. Negative responses were found for hepatocyte, CK20, vimentin, MUC2, SMAD4, WT1, TTF1, CDX2, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, ER, PR, GATA3, KIT, CD10, CD30, CD31, CD34, inhibin and HCG, OCT3/4, TFE3.\\nImmunohistochemistry was repeated for analysis of MSI in the primary tumor, and this turned out negative, which indicates a normal expression of MMR-proteins; thus, there was no support for MSI.\\nThe patient recovered well from the operation, but at 6 months after surgery, a follow-up computerized tomography (CT) showed 6 metastases in the lungs, with the diameter of the largest nodule being 11 mm. Pulmonary biopsy confirmed metastatic low-differentiated CHC. The pulmonary metastatic tissue was studied for MSI with PCR, but no such signs were found. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated positivity in CD3, CD4, CD8, and abundant infiltration of lymphocytes, and thus many CD8-positive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.\\nPD-L1 analysis using antibody PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx, Dako/Agilent was performed twice in both the primary tumor and the pulmonary metastases and turned out to be negative.\\nSorafenib treatment (400 mg \u00d72) was started in November 2016, but caused angioedema and was therefore stopped after 1 week. Treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin, 1,400 mg (1,000 mg/m2) and 35 mg (25 mg/m2), respectively on day 1 and day 8, and a new cycle on day 29, was started in January 2017. During this treatment, however, there was a doubling of AFP from 710 to 1,590 \u03bcg/L and the treatment was therefore stopped after 2 treatment cycles in late February 2017.\\nA treatment program was then planned with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg b.w. i.v. every third week and was started in March 2017. The first response evaluation by CT after 3 months of treatment showed that the number of pulmonary metastases had reduced from 6 to 3, and the largest diameter had reduced from 11 to 8 mm. The AFP level had dropped from 1790 to 52 \u03bcg/L within 2 months and became normal (<10 \u03bcg/L) within 4 months after the start of pembrolizumab (Fig. ).\\nThe patient had some eye problems with blurring of the sight on the right eye. An ophthalmologist diagnosed a vitreous detachment. This was interpreted as being caused by nearsightedness due to mechanical factors and the ophthalmologist could not see a relation with the medication.\\nAt 6 months following the start of the pembrolizumab treatment, a CT showed reduced sizes of the pulmonary metastases and AFP was stable at 5 \u03bcg/L. After 9 months of therapy, there was a complete radiological remission of the pulmonary metastases.\\nAfter 6 months of pembrolizumab therapy, however, there was a rise in her liver enzymes, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) up to 940 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 765 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 330 U/L, but normal plasma bilirubin and INR. This led to the cessation of pembrolizumab treatment in October 2017. A liver biopsy demonstrated mild portal and lobular inflammation, compatible with hepatitis with inflammatory grade 1\u20132/4. The inflammatory infiltration contained mainly lymphocytes, but also neutrophils, eosinophils and ceroid-containing macrophages. Fibrosis stage varied from 0 to 2/4 according to Batts and Ludwig.\\nAntinuclear antibodies, smooth muscle antibodies, liver-kidney-microsomal antigen-1 antibodies, and anti-mitochondrial antibodies were all negative. Tests for viral hepatitis A, B, C and E, as well as cytomegalovirus were negative. Serum immunoglobulin G level was 1.3 g/L (reference 6.7\u201315.0 g/L). The findings were compatible with checkpoint inhibitor-induced immune-related hepatitis.\\nThe patient was treated with prednisolone, initially 80 mg, then 40 mg, with subsequent dose reductions by 5\u201310 mg. Liver enzymes responded well to high-dose prednisolone, but once prednisolone doses were reduced to 25\u201330 mg/day, there were repeated relapses with rising ALT and AST. Due to the dependency on high-dose steroids, it was decided to start treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in January 2018, initially 500 mg twice daily, and then raised to 1 g twice daily. By this time, around 9 months after the start of pembrolizumab, the patient had also developed nonhemorrhagic diarrhea and leg edema with hypoalbuminemia (19 g/L). All of these side effects, however, resolved by 2 weeks after initiation of MMF treatment. The liver enzymes became normal and have remained normal during follow-up. Prednisolone was slowly tapered, and stopped in September 2018, 11 months after her presentation with hepatitis. MMF was stopped in April 2019. As by January 2020, 33 months after the start of the checkpoint inhibition treatment, the patient is doing well, and AFP remains normal. Liver enzymes are all within reference limits.\\nThe most recent CT of the thorax and abdomen from September 2019 (30 months after the start of pembrolizumab) shows no signs of malignancy.", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15288479': 1, '19638537': 1, '29427729': 1, '12454837': 1, '31239773': 1, '27182157': 1, '26917546': 1, '30607787': 1, '29517954': 1, '29113661': 1, '27039170': 1, '19701074': 1, '31048490': 1, '32508620': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
