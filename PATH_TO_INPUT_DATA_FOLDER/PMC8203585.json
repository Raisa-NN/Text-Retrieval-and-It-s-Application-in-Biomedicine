She had a history of hypertension and balanced diabetes, but no history of heart disease, trauma or dyslipidemia. Physical examination was normal apart from a bruit at right carotid auscultation.\\nCarotid duplex ultrasound (CDU) showed a right thin carotid diaphragm located in the proximal CCA (common carotid artery), (). High peak systolic velocities of 250 cm/second with turbulent color jet were detected at the level of proximal carotid web (), suggesting a greater stenosis then 70%. Velocities in the left internal carotid artery were normal, excluding stenosis. An aneurismal dilatation with approximately 5 cm length was also detected at the lesion. Subsequently under further evaluation, it was confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA) ( and ) showing a transverse, low density strip on proximal part on the right CCA causing lumen stenosis, with post aneurismal enlargement.\\nA carotid stent placement was refused by the patient. The aneurysm location in the proximal CCA increased the technical difficulty of a carotid endarterectomy operation. Medical therapy with anti-platelet (aspirin or clopidogrel bisulfate) was a good alternative.\\nOur patient benefits from a regular follow up and experienced no more neurologic effects.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20636713': 1, '29018133': 1, '28700472': 1, '24447601': 1, '28502339': 1, '25358695': 1, '34158890': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
