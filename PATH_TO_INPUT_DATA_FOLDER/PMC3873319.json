On clinical examination, there was a painful mild swelling of the left mandibular angle area. The pain and swelling had started 1 week earlier but had subsided after medication was administered. A panoramic radiograph revealed a well-defined round unilocular radiolucency surrounding the crown of the left lower third molar before the completion of the cemento-enamel junction (). CBCT images showed a well-defined round radiolucency with no cortical expansion surrounding the underdeveloped crown of a lower left third molar. The mandibular canal was identified inferior and lingual to the lesion (). A provisional diagnosis of odontogenic keratocyst was made, and the lesion was excised with the extraction of the involved tooth. The histopathological examination showed flattened squamous epithelium and inflamed stroma showing extensive odontogenic epithelial remnants, consistent with a dentigerous cyst.", "age": "[[12.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21731287': 2, '18230385': 1, '7018647': 1, '12022092': 1, '11402292': 1, '12405469': 1, '23120487': 1, '22442592': 1, '23714999': 1, '24380070': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3873319-1': 2, '3873319-2': 2, '3873319-3': 2, '3873319-4': 2, '3873319-5': 2, '3873319-6': 2, '3873319-7': 2, '3125666-1': 1}"}
