No ultrasound findings were observed at 21 weeks of gestation. The karyotype of the fetus was 46,XX. Then the CMA detected a 1.445 Mb duplication in the region of 19q13.42q13.43. The couple refused the CMA to confirm the chromosomal origin of the fetus and continued the pregnancy. The pregnant woman finally delivered a female infant at 39w + 2d gestation, whose birth weight was 3300 g and length was 50 cm.\\nWe made a follow up on the postnatal health conditions for all cases, including congenital defects, developmental retardation, body stature, craniofacial dysmorphisms, and skeletal anomalies. All children were in healthy conditions, and no apparent abnormalities were observed till now, but long term follow up analysis was still necessary.", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16824814': 1, '1084117': 1, '18674648': 1, '23401394': 1, '29500522': 1, '9268103': 1, '20531469': 1, '21326309': 1, '28863777': 1, '12362043': 1, '17431920': 1, '18342596': 1, '12496512': 1, '17437325': 1, '29042784': 1, '10951478': 1, '23215555': 1, '25249449': 1, '30221343': 1, '31348322': 2, '28424701': 1, '24764755': 1, '15503276': 1, '31464994': 1, '12446804': 1, '23952617': 1, '33451353': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7809756-1': 2, '7809756-2': 2, '6708658-1': 1}"}
