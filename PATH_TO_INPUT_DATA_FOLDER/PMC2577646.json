The patient complained of vague flank pain. Medical records showed that she had a normal IVU report but also multiple sonographies indicating bilateral hydronephrosis. Her previous physician referred her to us to resolve this apparent incongruity.\\nOn physical examination, no positive finding related to her history was found. Kidney sonography revealed dilated pelvises (Figure ). In view of her history we suspected parapelvic cysts, but sonography did not show the cysts directly, and indirect signs such as the \"convexity sign\" did not help us to differentiate.\\nIVU also was performed and showed normal-looking fornices but stretched infundibuli (Figure ). Then abdominal CT scans with and without contrast were implemented. The non-enhanced CT scan demonstrated dilated calyces and pelvises bilaterally, and no septa were observable (Figure ). Surprisingly, the CT scan with contrast showed multiple, bilateral parapelvic cysts (Figure ).", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28281789': 1, '412864': 1, '31363461': 1, '1502358': 1, '30740344': 1, '26048408': 1, '6978029': 1, '16734865': 1, '29382187': 1, '7465841': 1, '24347451': 1, '26019858': 1, '29636957': 1, '18801196': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
