His hospital course was also complicated by Clostridium difficile infection. In January 2019, during his ICU admission, he again experienced septic shock. Blood culture from central and peripheral lines showed C. gleum and Acinetobacter baumannii bacteraemia. The profile for C. gleum showed sensitivity to levofloxacin, amikacin and cotrimoxazole and intermediate sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. The patient was treated with levofloxacin (750 mg provided intravenously daily for 2 weeks) and piperacillin/tazobactam (to cover Acinetobacter), and the central line was removed. The patient's infection was cured.", "age": "[[73.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24410052': 1, '11897576': 1, '16000421': 1, '14715802': 1, '24060496': 1, '27419074': 1, '25995646': 1, '29188069': 2, '28890506': 1, '28438192': 2, '24796989': 1, '17889369': 1, '28332028': 1, '9420049': 1, '33898043': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5692238-1': 1, '5402668-1': 1}"}
