He also complained of dysuria and intermittent right-sided subcostal pleuritic pain. He denied diarrhea, melena, any recent travels, or any sick contacts. On physical examination, patient had a temperature of 36.7\u00baC, was hypotensive initially with systolic blood pressure in the 70s-80s; however, with aggressive fluid resuscitation, his blood pressure came up and was recorded as 98/52 on admission. His pulse was 90 and respiratory rate was 18 saturating 98% on room air. Remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Pt was anicteric. Lungs were clear on auscultation. Cardiac examination findings were normal. Abdomen was soft, with active bowel sounds. No significant tenderness, guarding or rigidity was elicited in the right upper quadrant of abdomen. There was no costorenal tenderness. Initial laboratory testing revealed a WBC count of 36.6*1000 with bands of 7%; creatinine was 2.1, BUN 54, AST 84, ALT 51, alkaline phosphatase 182, total bilirubin 2.5, direct bilirubin 1.3, albumin 1.7, total protein 5.5, PT 15.1, PTT 38, and INR 1.5. Urinalysis was positive for large leukocyte esterase with marked pyuria of more than 60/HPF. The chest X-ray was unremarkable.\\nPatient was started on empiric intravenous antibiotics with Ampicillin-Sulbactam, and blood and urine cultures were sent. In view of his complaint of intermittent right-sided sub costal pain and a negative chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound was obtained. Interestingly, the ultrasound revealed heterogenous liver masses and associated partial main portal vein thrombosis. To further characterize these findings, a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis was performed []. The CT scan showed multiple low-density liver lesions with enhancing rims as well as perihepatic fluid collections suggestive of multiple hepatic abscesses. There was also associated partial main portal vein thrombosis and right portal vein thrombosis. The presence of diverticulosis was noted as well. The finding of diverticulosis raised the possibility of diverticulitis as the source of infection; however, this could not be determined convincingly. After consultation with the surgeon and radiologist, CT guided drain was placed in the largest hepatic abscess with a view aimed at interval follow up of the lesions. In the meantime patient's blood culture revealed Streptococcus Anginosus (2/2), susceptible to penicillins. Patient continued to do well with mild discomfort intermittently in the right subcostal/ right upper abdominal quadrant. His leukocytosis overall improved with some fluctuations, but did not resolve. His creatinine levels normalised. His abdomen remained benign on examination. The hemodynamic parameters were stable. Repeat blood cultures did not show any growth and the cultures from hepatic abscess drain showed no growth as well. Surprisingly, a repeat CT scan done 6 days after the drain was placed showed that there was overall increased size of the intraparenchymal and extrahepatic abscesses. New interloop abscess were present in the right mid abdomen and in the pelvis. Right portal vein thrombosis was redemonstrated. In view of progression of the disease, decision was made for exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperative findings were consistent with multiple intra-abdominal abscesses and adhesions. The sigmoid colon was noted to be completely adherent to the bladder with extensive fibrolytic area. This was consistent with Sigmoid Diverticulitis with the formation of a colovesical fistula. The patient underwent sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis, repair of the colovesical fistula, enterolysis, and drainage of multiple intraabdominal abscesses.\\nPatient's postoperative course was unremarkable. He showed gradual recovery. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis done 6 days post surgery showed improvement in liver lesions. Patient was discharged home on hospital day 24 to complete a total 4-week course of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate. A follow-up CT scan done about 3 months later did not show any intra-abdominal or hepatic abscess.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9796653': 1, '25197585': 2, '27350946': 1, '31857289': 1, '2649957': 1, '24421818': 1, '28096994': 2, '24917758': 1, '14410219': 1, '30755933': 1, '11317256': 1, '28522912': 1, '30798788': 2, '952571': 1, '2380375': 1, '27170608': 1, '1734062': 1, '34804302': 2, '9709892': 1, '34078290': 2, '15232186': 1, '28942408': 1, '31796454': 1, '34527514': 2, '27447938': 1, '32398999': 1, '21572613': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5224772-1': 1, '8577612-1': 1, '8173975-1': 1, '8433271-1': 1, '6388486-1': 1, '4147201-1': 1}"}
