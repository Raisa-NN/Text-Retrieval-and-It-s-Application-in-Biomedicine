On examination, a 3-mm brown macule was noted. The lesion was punch-excised.\\nThe histological examination revealed a junctional and dermal melanocytic proliferation. The basal epidermal layer was pigmented, with a few junctional nests showing dusty intracytoplasmic melanin pigment. The dermal component showed regular nests of epithelioid cells with central lumen-like structures, reminiscent of ducts and acini (Fig. ). The cells had bland morphology, with round and regular nuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm. There were no proeminent nuclei but few pieces of evidence of differentiation, as all the cells presented the same epithelioid morphology. High-power examination did not show mitotic figures.\\nImmunohistochemically, the glandular structures were negative for pan-cytokeratin, whereas adnexal glandular structures and the epidermis were strongly stained. Colloidal iron did not show any presence of mucin inside the central lumen-like spaces. We performed a melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells 1 (MART-1/Melan-A) immunostain, which confirmed the melanocytic origin of the pseudoglandular structures (Fig. ).", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10472762': 1, '29624714': 1, '9821077': 1, '25407962': 1, '18005169': 1, '11100809': 1, '31700842': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
