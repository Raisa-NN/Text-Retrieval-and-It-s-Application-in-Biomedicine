CT showed round or oval pulmonary nodules, with smooth margin associated with marked enhancement. She was referred for whole body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for detection of primary site and to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. PET/CT showed an intense uptake in the bilateral pulmonary nodules [] with largest nodule located in right lower lobe with a standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 10.5. Some of the lesions did not show FDG uptake patient underwent minithoracotomy and wedge biopsy of the lesion [] and biopsy confirmed PSH []. A diagnosis of bilateral multiple PSH was made and she was advised follow-up.", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22291338': 1, '19415961': 1, '15681603': 1, '25634202': 1, '21467848': 1, '29221270': 1, '17101410': 1, '15828298': 1, '29930720': 1, '13284701': 1, '9843249': 1, '20675249': 1, '25210285': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
