A full spine radiograph revealed an abnormal morphology of the vertebrae at the thoracolumbar junction, most prominent L1 and L2, associated with hyperkyphosis at the thoracolumbar junction, facet dislocation at Th12-L1, L1-L2 and L2-L3 (, white arrows) and spondylolisthesis of Th12 and L2. Anterior beaking of the vertebral bodies L1 and L2 was seen (, arrowheads), resembling a tongue or bullet. A pelvic radiograph as part of the full spine showed bilateral hip dysplasia with underdevelopment of the acetabuli and femoral epiphyses (, white arrows). Medical history revealed recurrent otitis media, upper airway infections, and mild obstructive sleep apnea.\\nBased on the combination of clinical and imaging features a storage disease was suspected and additional examinations were performed. A radiograph of the hand showed a V-shaped deformity of the wrist, hypoplastic morphology of the proximal metacarpals (, white arrows) and a delay in carpal ossification (, asterix). The skeletal manifestations were suggestive of dysostosis multiplex congenita. MRI of the spine showed no spinal stenosis and no cord anomaly and confirmed the vertebrae hypoplasia with posterior scalloping (, white arrows). Urinary examination exposed high dermatan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate levels in keeping with mucopolysaccharidosis VI. The diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis VI was confirmed by enzymatic analysis of arylsulphatase B in leucocytes and homozygosity of the c.937C>G mutation (exon 5 ARSB gene). Both parents were carriers of the same mutation although consanguinity was not known.", "age": "[[6.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30442151': 1, '34693203': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
