The patient\u2019s complaints began after he experienced a fall 7 months ago. At that time, radiography of his shoulder revealed soft tissue trauma, which was treated. However, his complaints showed no improvement, and he visited another hospital 3 days later. After radiography, the patient was administered a sling and analgesic, following soft tissue trauma diagnosis. The patient applied to our clinic approximately 7 months after the initial trauma. Subsequently, his left shoulder was fixed in internal rotation, but his passive shoulder movements were extremely limited and painful. Notably, the patient\u2019s neurovascular examination was normal. Therefore, the patient was believed to have experienced posterior shoulder dislocation, and the clinical diagnosis was confirmed by radiological imaging (). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a reverse Hill-Sachs lesion on the humeral head and on approximately 25% of the joint surface. In addition, no associated fractures were noted. The patient was scheduled for the McLaughlin surgical procedure. Open reduction was performed through a deltopectoral approach. When the posteriorly locked humeral head was difficult to reduce, a small Darrach retractor was used. However, during this procedure, because the osteoporotic humerus showed a collapse of approximately 30% on the posterior articular surface, an iatrogenic Hill-Sachs lesion was added to the reverse Hill-Sachs lesion at the beginning of the humeral head (). When the glenoid was examined intraoperatively, there was minimal cartilaginous damage on the anterior and posterior glenoid rim cartilage. The patient was intraoperatively reevaluated, and previously, planned surgical procedure was performed. The subscapular is tendon was transferred to the anterior defective area of the humeral head with three anchor sutures, and stability was tested with shoulder movements. In external rotation and abduction, the shoulder was found to be anteriorly subluxed. Although the defect in the posterior humeral head covered approximately 30% of the joint surface, the lesion was not deep; this defect was type 2 according to Calandra et al. [] classification system. No anterior glenoid rim defect was noted. Considering the possibility that this partial engaging lesion could develop into a non-engaging lesion, fixation was performed with a Kirschner wire, while the joint was in the reduction position (). The patient was administered a sling, and his left shoulder was immobilized for 4 weeks. 1-month post-operation, the wire was removed, and the shoulder movement was initiated under the guidance of a physiotherapist. At the 62-month follow-up, CT images were transformed into three-dimensional format, and the defective joint surface area was calculated using the Image J program (Version 1.51s, NIH, USA). The measurements revealed a defective area of approximately 25% in the anterior part of the humeral head and 30% in the posterior part (). At the final follow-up, the patient reported no pain and active shoulder movements (flexion: 150\u00b0, extension: 20\u00b0, abduction: 120\u00b0, internal rotation: 60\u00b0, and external rotation 60\u00b0) (). Constant shoulder score was calculated as 84. The patient was pleased with his results and was able to continue his routine activities.", "age": "[[42.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29387470': 1, '3805075': 1, '19186079': 1, '2590322': 1, '14946209': 1, '11027751': 1, '19711163': 1, '23823049': 1, '18709379': 1, '29101634': 1, '28697084': 1, '24384275': 1, '17644006': 1, '31534941': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
