He had limited range of motion of his right elbow due to the severe pain and swelling. Plain radiographs of his right elbow showed an isolated Regan-Morrey type III ulnar coronoid process fracture (). When the soft tissue swelling had reduced, he underwent an examination of his right elbow under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the passive range of movement of the right elbow was <90\u00b0 due to the impaction of the fracture fragment. An open reduction through an anterior approach was performed and Kirschner wires were inserted to fix the coronoid process fracture (). Kirschner wires were opted for the ease of post-operative removal as the patient was not keen to have a retained implant after recovery. Postoperatively, the Kirschner wires were removed after 3 weeks and his right elbow was protected with an above elbow posterior slab for 6 weeks before he started on gradual active range of movement exercises without any complication. Bony union was achieved postoperatively with good outcome based on the MEPS ().", "age": "[[23.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'2193129': 1, '23412150': 1, '20888261': 1, '26815615': 1, '30915298': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6424314-1': 2}"}
