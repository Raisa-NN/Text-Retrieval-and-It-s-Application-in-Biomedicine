On admission, he was intubated and on vasopressors due to circulatory shock. Endotracheal intubation had been performed at an outside facility; mechanical ventilation was reportedly difficult. At examination, no breath sounds were audible on the left side, and the jugular veins were distended. Point-of-care ultrasound showed no lung sliding on the left. Tube thoracostomy was performed and a pigtail catheter placed, with positive air drainage. Chest radiograph showed a well-positioned catheter and good lung expansion ().\\nOn day two, the patient was extubated and transferred to the Intermediate Care Unit. Three days later he had abrupt onset of dyspnea, extensive subcutaneous emphysema, and drainage of serosanguinous fluid through the chest tube instead of air. Chest computerized tomography showed the pigtail within the lung parenchyma and a residual pneumothorax ().\\nThe decision was to remove the pigtail and place a traditional chest tube. The patient had an uneventful course, with complete resolution of pneumothorax. The chest tube was removed after six days, and the patient was discharged without further complications.", "age": "[[92.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10323171': 1, '34158904': 1, '12728150': 1, '30505508': 1, '32064437': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
