On physical examination a firm mass was palpated in that area. Imaging with ultrasound (U/S) scan examination revealed a solid mass measuring 3 \u00d7 2 cm (). Fine needle aspiration of the mass was inconclusive and complete surgical excision was decided. During surgery it was noted that the tumor was attached to the wall of the greater saphenous vein, and it was removed en bloc with a small part of the vein. The resected specimen was submitted for pathologic evaluation. Grossly the specimen consisted of a firm, well-circumscribed, oval shaped mass measuring 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.5 cm. Its cut surface was white in colour and had a whorling pattern reminiscent of leiomyoma. Microscopic examination confirmed the gross impression and proved it to be a smooth muscle tumor (). The diagnosis was also confirmed with immunohistochemical stains (desmin +, SMA +, and S-100 protein \u2212) (). The tumor also had no areas of necrosis. Its cellularity was moderate and there was no significant nuclear atypia. The mitotic activity was low (up to 1 mitotic figure/40 HPF) and the proliferation index Ki-67 was also low (approximately 1%). Morphologically this tumor was a leiomyoma. The patient was discharged on the first postoperative day.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'13595550': 1, '1523438': 1, '9846292': 1, '7149825': 1, '18521408': 1, '18804951': 1, '7860681': 1, '1159575': 1, '24363945': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
