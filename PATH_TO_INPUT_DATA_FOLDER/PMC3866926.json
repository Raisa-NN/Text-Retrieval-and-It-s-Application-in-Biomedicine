Similar episodes were also noticed approximately one month ago. During this time he was hospitalized for community-acquired-pneumonia and was discharged three days later. His other complaints included productive cough with whitish blood-tinged sputum, frontal headache, mild subjective fever and mid-sternal chest discomfort. Past medical history included only hypertension. No home medications were used. He confessed to regularly using cocaine once per week of various amounts for the last 18 years. His last cocaine use was on the night before admission. Other social history included occasional cigarette smoking, but no alcohol or intravenous drug use. He denied hazardous exposure.\\nInitial vital signs revealed a tachycardic (heart rate: 104\u2013110 beats per minute) and hypertensive (blood pressure: 179/121 mmHg) patient, with peripheral oxygen saturation of 86\u201389% on 2 L nasal cannula. Pertinent physical examination finding revealed multiple tattoos, mild nasal erythema without perforation signs of the nasal septum and a previous exploratory laparotomy scar (stab wound several years ago). Cardiovascular and lung examination were significant for jugular vein distention, tachycardia, 2/6 systolic murmur at mitral valve area with radiation to the left axilla and bilateral diffuse coarse crackles. Initial laboratory workup at admission was insignificant except for elevated brain nautriuretic peptide of 894 ng/L and positive urine toxicology screen for cocaine. Electrocardiogram on admission showed sinus tachycardia; left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy and nonspecific T wave abnormalities over the anterior wall leads. Chest X-ray (Figure ) showed bilateral patchy opacities representing pulmonary edema or possible hemorrhage. Computed tomography of chest (Figure ) revealed bilateral peribronchovascular airspace consolidation, ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening and small bilateral pleural effusions. Our differential included an etiology causing pulmonary edema versus a less likely pulmonary hemorrhage or atypical infection.\\nDue to his recent use of cocaine \u03b2-blockers were not used to control the hypertension however we opted to use amlodipine 10 mg daily instead. Pulmonary team was consulted; the impression was consistent with pulmonary edema from questionable congestive heart failure (CHF), which could have been from the history of cocaine use rather than a primary pulmonary cause. The recommendations included initiating a treatment with a diuretic agent, vasodilators and obtaining 2D-echocardiogram. Management consisted of amlodipine 10 mg daily, furosemide 20 mg twice daily, hydralazine 10 mg daily and lisinopril 10 mg daily. The 2D echocardiogram showed moderate left ventricle dilation (left ventricular end diastolic dimension LVEDD of 6.3 cm) without signs of apical ballooning; the left atrium with 4.9 cm moderate-severely dilated, moderate global hypokinesis of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 25%, stage 3 diastolic dysfunction and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (Additional files , , , , and ). By the 4th day he was clinically asymptomatic and the pulmonary examination was unremarkable. Repeat chest x-ray showed almost complete resolution of bilateral patchy airspace consolidation phenomena however with some bibasilar persistence. The cardiology team was consulted for further recommendations, cardiac catheterization and the possibility of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) placement. The patient was taken for cardiac catheterization on hospital day 5 and ischemic cardiomyopathy was ruled out. An association between his symptoms and the binge consuming of cocaine was established. Cardiac biopsy was not recommended at this time. Re-evaluation of all the above findings including reconsidering a cardiac biopsy 5 months after the discharge was arranged. On the 6th day, the psychiatry service counseled the patient; he agreed to undergo a rehabilitation course in an inpatient institution. On the following day he was transferred to the rehabilitation center on his CHF medications.\\nFive months later and after successful completing of the treatment course at the rehabilitation center the patient was re-evaluated. Repeat echocardiogram was performed and showed an improved ejection fraction of 50-55%, improvement of the previously dilated size of the left ventricle (LVEDD from 6.3 cm to 5.4 cm) and mild-moderately dilated left atrium of 4.5 cm. The clinical condition was remarkably better, echocardiographic geometric changes partially resolved. Beta-blocker was added; cardiac biopsy was not done. Evidences for the strong association between previous cocaine abuse and newly diagnosed CHF were clinically confirmed.", "age": "[[38.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19463023': 1, '7750342': 1, '17482989': 1, '30700023': 1, '12197823': 1, '18773229': 1, '20513064': 1, '20109599': 1, '16376443': 1, '17826394': 1, '21605722': 1, '24341463': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
