The lesion persisted till 5-6 months ago with no cure. Since then, the surrounded skin gradually became red, erythematous, and other ulcers appeared on the skin. On physical examination, the left side of the face was edematous and red and some ulcers with purulent exudates were seen. The lesion involved the nose and the lips but nasal and buccal mucosa was intact. CT-scanning of paranasal sinuses showed soft tissue thickness of the left cheek without involvement of the ipsilateral sinuses. Evaluations on exudate specimens revealed branched and aseptate hyphae, indicating mucormycosis. Punch biopsy and then surgical biopsy were done and both showed granulomatos dermatitis accompanying broad branched and aseptate hyphae that invaded the vascular endothelium. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of mucormycosis and therapy with Amphotricin-B deoxycholate was begun. After the patient became stable, extensive repetitive debridement of the involved area were performed. Therapy with amphotricine-B deoxycholate continued for a total dose of 2 g with good outcome and recovery of the lesion. The patient was then referred for plastic surgery.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'703789': 1, '16966176': 1, '10756000': 1, '6928943': 1, '2050857': 1, '23984008': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
