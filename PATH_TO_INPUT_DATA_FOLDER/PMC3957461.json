On physical examination, a 2/4 early, medium-frequency, diastolic murmur was audible at the right mid-sternal border. The remainder of his physical examination was unremarkable and an electrocardiogram was normal. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a type B quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) (three cusps of equal size and one smaller cusp) associated with mild aortic regurgitation by color Doppler imaging, likely from a coaptation defect [ and ].[] The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension measured by M-mode was normal (4.58 cm, z-score + 0.3) with a shortening fraction of 31%. The remainder of the cardiac anatomy was normal, including the origins of the coronary arteries.\\nTwo years later, the patient remained asymptomatic and the echocardiography showed stable, mild aortic regurgitation [], now associated with mild left ventricular dilation []. By M-mode the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension measured 5.82 cm (z-score + 2.8), the end-systolic dimension was 3.7 cm (z-score + 1.9), and the shortening fraction was 35%.", "age": "[[9.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'4698133': 1, '2181849': 1, '12492123': 1, '15311857': 1, '25926908': 1, '24688249': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
