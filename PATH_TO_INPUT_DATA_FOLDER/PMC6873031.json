Past medical history and review of systems were unremarkable. The parents are non-consanguineous and none of his family had similar lesions. Skin examination revealed multiple tiny brownish keratotic pits on both palms (Fig. ). There were no similar lesions elsewhere on his body. Hair, nails, and mucous membranes were normal. Complete blood count with differentials, peripheral blood smear, liver enzymes, urea, creatinine, electrolytes, abdomen and pelvis ultrasound, chest X-ray, and computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were normal. Punch skin biopsy from the lesion revealed epidermal depression with an overlying column of compact orthokeratosis (Fig. ). Based on the above clinicopathological findings, a diagnosis of PPPK type 1 was made. The patient was reassured and started on 40% urea ointment and 20% salicylic acid ointment with little improvement.", "age": "[[59.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29500825': 1, '8349860': 1, '15235186': 1, '29489036': 1, '22503127': 1, '15888140': 1, '17428117': 1, '8651714': 1, '31762743': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
