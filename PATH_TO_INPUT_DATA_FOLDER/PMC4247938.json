Recipient, donor, and graft weight were 51 Kg, 72 Kg, and 774 g, respectively. Graft to recipient weight ratio was 1.52%. During recipient's hepatectomy, thrombosis of the hepatic artery with extensive subintimal dissection until celiac trunk was observed. The use of hepatic artery for graft revascularization was judged impossible. We decided to use the RGEA for arterial reconstruction. The artery was released from the gastric greater curvature, mobilized under the gastric pylorus, and approximated without tension to the liver graft. Despite the discrepancy in size between the donors right hepatic artery and the recipient RGEA, arterial anastomosis was performed successfully in an end-to-end fashion using separate 8\u20130 Prolene sutures. Magnification loupes (6x) were worn by surgeons. A parallel bulldog clamp was used to approximate the arteries during anastomosis (Figures and ). Intrahepatic blood flow was confirmed by intraoperative Doppler (). During postoperative period, patency of arterial anastomosis was evaluated daily by Doppler exam. Patient was discharged on the 16th postoperative day and is in good general condition, 34 months after transplantation.", "age": "[[62.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20818743': 1, '26401076': 1, '11120153': 1, '10830238': 1, '22410041': 1, '10791224': 1, '10148365': 1, '16499596': 1, '25478255': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
