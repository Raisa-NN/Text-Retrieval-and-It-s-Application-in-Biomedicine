This problem started on her right first, second, and third digits, and then both hands were gradually involved. Leukonychia had a significant progress over a period of 6 months []. The patient's history revealed exposure to chemical substances without gloves (detergents and bleaching agent). Past medical and family history was negative. In physical examination, the nail folds were normal. Furthermore, general and skin physical examination was normal. Laboratory tests were performed, and nail biopsy was suggested. However, the patient did not give consent for biopsy. Laboratory tests (complete blood count/differential, fasting blood sugar, phosphorus, calcium, Vitamin D3, antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor) were normal except zinc level (40 mg/dL [normal range: 70\u2013114 mg/dL]).\\nAs the zinc level was low, zinc plus capsules (Euro Vital, Germany) and moisturizing cream were subscribed for 6 months, and the patient was followed up for every 2 months. The patient was also advised not to work with detergents and bleaching agents without gloves.\\nDuring the follow-up period, an improvement was seen, and the progress of leukonychia was stopped []. A repeated blood test showed a normal zinc level.", "age": "[[35.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26955163': 1, '15727678': 1, '19707480': 2, '22565422': 1, '22340696': 1, '22199074': 1, '22937758': 1, '11174421': 1, '27857831': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2729487-1': 1}"}
