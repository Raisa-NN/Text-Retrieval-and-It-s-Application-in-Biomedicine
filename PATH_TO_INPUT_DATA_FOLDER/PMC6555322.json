The tooth was tender on percussion with adherent calculus having grade II mobility characteristic of localized periodontitis.

After checking the subjective and objective numbness, the tooth removal was completed by maxillary anterior forceps. The postextraction instructions were given along with oral analgesics. We found that maxillary canine had three separate roots with three root canals [Figure and ]. We took intraoral periapical radiograph and did access opening to find the number of root canals present [Figure and ].
