He had a positive family history of type 1 diabetes from his mother. During physical examination, he was alert, afebrile, with blood pressure of 126/84 mmHg, pulse rate of 107, respiratory rate 18, with dry mucous membranes and reduced skin turgor.\\nHis lab tests were notable for plasma glucose 479 mg/dL with large amounts of serum and urine ketones, pH 7.15, anion gap 36, lactic acid 2.7 mmol/L, calculated serum osmolality 288 mOsm/L, serum sodium 129 mEq/L, potassium 3.2 mEq/L, bicarbonate 9 mmol/L, chloride 84 mEq/L, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, phosphorous 2.6 mg/dL, magnesium 1.3 mg/dL, HbA1C 14.4%, urine glucose > 1000 mg/dL and urine toxicology negative. Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia and prolonged QT interval (Figure ). He was diagnosed with DKA and was admitted to the intensive care unit.\\nIntravenous insulin was started after magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus replacement. Intravenous insulin was stopped, or dosage reduced several times due to the severity of hypokalemia. A total of 400-450 mEq per day of potassium chloride was administered intravenously and orally during the first three days. Also, total magnesium sulfate 6-8 g was given daily for three days. In the first four days, his daily urine output ranged from 5.5 to 6.5 L. This was repleted with oral and intravenous fluids. Hyperglycemia, ketonemia and anion gap metabolic acidosis resolved after four days.\\nOn day 5, his clinical condition improved, and acidosis resolved. His biochemical tests showed metabolic alkalosis with bicarbonate level of 38 mmol/L, and the patient remained alkalotic without any signs of dehydration. He had no vomiting and did not receive sodium bicarbonate or diuretics throughout hospitalization. He was not on any other medications.\\nFurthermore, despite aggressive repletion of potassium and magnesium, the patient remained hypokalemic and hypomagnesemic. He required 40-80 mEq of potassium chloride and 1 g of oral magnesium daily after acidosis and polyuria resolved to bring the serum potassium and magnesium concentrations to the normal level.\\nOn day 8, while the patient was being discharged from the hospital, his urinary electrolytes and serum electrolytes were checked. The lab results showed potassium 4.5 mEq/L, magnesium 1.5 mg/dL, calcium 9.2 mg/dL, bicarbonate 33 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dL. The urine random studies revealed sodium 32 mEq/L, chloride 54 mEq/L, potassium 79 mEq/L, magnesium 8.5 mg/dL, calcium 6.5 mg/dL, phosphorus 48.8 mg/dL and creatinine 60.3 mg/dL.\\nIn this case, the management of ketoacidosis required high doses of intravenous potassium chloride to obtain normal serum potassium levels. After the management of DKA, the patient showed continued hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia with a new metabolic alkalosis while urine chloride was more than 40 mEq/L.\\nHe was discharged with Levemir\u00ae insulin, lispro insulin, oral magnesium gluconate and potassium chloride. He was also advised to go to the nephrology clinic for follow-up.\\nSeven weeks after discharge, his repeated random urine study revealed sodium 69 mEq/L, chloride 125 mEq/L, potassium 79 mEq/L, magnesium 13.8 mg/dL, calcium 3.5 mg/dL, phosphorus 23.8 mg/dL and creatinine 162 mg/dL. Unfortunately, there were no serum electrolytes obtained since hospitalization.", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19451210': 1, '25880437': 1, '12610073': 1, '7046439': 1, '18667063': 1, '21255074': 1, '24855283': 1, '25012174': 1, '21617100': 1, '11194218': 1, '34941636': 2, '31215303': 1, '12112667': 1, '28003083': 1, '23031616': 2, '33954067': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3470992-1': 1, '8705311-1': 1}"}
