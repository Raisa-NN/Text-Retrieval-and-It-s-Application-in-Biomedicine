The patient had been treated over a 2-year period with focal and scatter laser photocoagulation as well as intravitreal bevacizumab therapy to treat both the proliferative retinopathy and macular edema. Two weeks prior to the onset of his new symptoms, the patient had a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 OS and a new mild vitreous hemorrhage due to PDR in his left eye which was treated with an intravitreal bevacizumab injection. Examination on the day of the patient's new symptoms revealed a BCVA of 20/50 OS. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT, Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) showed a taut anterior-posterior nasal vitreomacular membrane and an adjacent FTMH, measuring 363 \u00b5m at its base (fig. ). The patient was started on topical bromfenac 0.9% OS every 12 h (b.i.d.) for adjunctive retinal edema management. Eight weeks later, the patient's BCVA improved to 20/30 OS and OCT examination revealed spontaneous closure of the macular hole and persistent VMT in the nasal macula (fig. ). The macular hole continues to remain closed 9 months following spontaneous closure.", "age": "[[28.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24108069': 1, '14769600': 1, '18441183': 1, '7785690': 1, '20008730': 1, '18773279': 1, '10896340': 1, '22973980': 1, '15808159': 1, '27099607': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
