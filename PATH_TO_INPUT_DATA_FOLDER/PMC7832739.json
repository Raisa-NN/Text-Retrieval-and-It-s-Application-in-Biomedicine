His vital signs were normal, and general examination was unremarkable. Abdominal examination revealed no clinical signs of bowel obstruction; groin examination revealed a 40 mm irreducible right-sided inguinal hernia with no signs of strangulation; the scrotal examination was normal (Figure ).\\nRoutine blood tests including full blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), liver and kidney functions were all within a normal range, and there was no clinical indication for any imaging modality. Our provisional diagnosis was an incarcerated inguinal hernia. Since these types of hernias are better repaired as soon as diagnosed to avoid strangulation, an attempt to repair the hernia through a standard groin incision revealed a viable caecum and long non-inflamed appendix in the hernia sac (Figure ).\\nHerniotomy was carried out; the patient had an uneventful recovery, was discharged home the following day, and was seen in the clinic six weeks after, and no signs of postoperative complications were noted.", "age": "[[6.0, 'week']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26621139': 1, '9914352': 1, '18186392': 1, '24280148': 1, '19910011': 1, '23476866': 2, '23932620': 1, '18214637': 1, '33510993': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3580932-1': 1}"}
