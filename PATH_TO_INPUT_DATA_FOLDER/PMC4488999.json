She did not have a history of any underlying disease. Skin examination of the second digit indicated a 3-4 cm hyperkeratotic plaque, with a distinct raised annular border and an atrophic center that was compatible with PM. Histopathological analysis showed \u201ccornoid lamella\u201d and confirmed the diagnosis of PM. The lesion was refractory to common treatments. She had not responded to routine therapies like topical corticosteroids, topical tretinoin, topical salicylic acid and various emollients, and keratolytic agent. Cryosurgery and laser ablation did not have acceptable response. Recently the lesion became increasingly large, pruritic, and cosmetically displeasing that induced psychological stress, shame, and anxiety about the general appearance, along with cosmetic concern. Due to the recalcitrance of lesions to common topical treatments after 2 years of appropriate treatment, it was decided that the patient would get treated with excision of the plaque and application of a STSG from her thigh. After a 4-month follow-up, hyperkeratotic lesion was resolved; there was no recurrent lesion and an acceptable result was obtained [].", "age": "[[22.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17092865': 1, '15187342': 1, '23122020': 1, '12705749': 1, '10427514': 1, '23984259': 1, '26199929': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
