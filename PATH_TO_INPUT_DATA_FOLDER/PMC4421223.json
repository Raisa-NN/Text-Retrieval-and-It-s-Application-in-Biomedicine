On admission, massive limb and scrotal oedema, bilateral pleural effusion and mild ascites were noted, without other relevant physical signs. BP was 115/70 mmHg. Renal function was normal, with serum creatinine (sCr) of 1.05 mg/dL (92.82 \u03bcmol/L) and BUN of 29 mg/dL (10.35 mmol/L). Urinalysis showed >100 RBC/hpf and abundant hyaline and granular casts. Proteinuria was 20\u201333 g/day, with typical hypoalbuminaemia. Serum C3 and C4 were normal at 0.98 and 0.2 g/L, respectively. No anaemia or other haematological abnormalities were present. Antinuclear Abs were positive at a titre of 1:320 and homogeneous pattern, while anti-ds-DNA Abs were positive at 1:320 (212,00 WHO U/ml). Upon aggressive i.v. diuretic treatment (up to 250 mg furosemide/day) sCr and BUN increased over 8 days to 6.6 and 62 mg/dL (583.4 \u03bcmol/L and 22.13 mmol/L), respectively. The patient was then transferred to our Nephrology ward, where renal vein thrombosis was ruled out by Doppler ultrasound, and accurate fluid management stabilized renal function. A renal biopsy was immediately obtained.", "age": "[[62.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'7747733': 1, '12371978': 1, '12631361': 1, '9573563': 1, '9158203': 1, '26064516': 2, '12244123': 1, '11961029': 1, '9158204': 1, '7564073': 1, '32173580': 1, '9761542': 1, '25983887': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4438411-1': 1}"}
