Dermatological examination\\nrevealed a brown-blue irregular, well defined macule, with approximately 8 mm, with\\nblack-brown dots on the periphery ().\\nOn dermoscopy, there was a black-brown lesion, in a homogenous pattern, composed of\\nstructureless areas and with streaks in the periphery and satellite gray-blue\\nlesions (). Due to the suspicion of\\nmelanoma, an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathology revealed spindle-shaped\\nand dendritic, strongly pigmented melanocytes, amid dense fibrous stroma and\\nmelanophages, predominantly occupying upper and mid dermis (). Satellite lesions were seen in the adjacent skin,\\nconstituted by melanocytes similar to the central lesion, forming small aggregates\\nlocated close to the dermal vessels ().\\nThe diagnosis was of common blue nevus with satellitosis.", "age": "[[15.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22826721': 1, '19841410': 1, '11843220': 1, '19461250': 1, '24163656': 2, '10583181': 1, '10871065': 1, '10826091': 1, '20180029': 1, '29875860': 1, '29267439': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3806697-1': 1}"}
