Diagnosed with severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type, she is dependent in all activities of daily living, including mobility out of bed. She is able to respond to others with subtle facial expressions but has no comprehensible verbal output. She has hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and deep venous thrombosis. She has a cardiac pacemaker, which was placed due to sick sinus syndrome. Her maintenance medications included amiodarone, metoprolol, rivaroxaban, and patch rivastigmine. Quetiapine was sparingly administered at half to one tablet of 25 mg, as necessary for insomnia and restlessness.\\nIn particular, the patient has been on rivastigmine transdermal patch since April 2009 at a dose of 4.6 mg/24 hours, and which was increased to 9.5 mg/24 hours in August 2009. In these doses of rivastigmine, no note of adverse events occurred. Because of the progression of her dementia symptoms, the rivastigmine dose was increased to 13.3 mg/24 hours in March 2014.", "age": "[[81.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23561545': 1, '19893314': 1, '12640593': 1, '11577800': 1, '18029952': 1, '23179184': 1, '10071118': 1, '25786075': 1, '23684446': 1, '21507139': 1, '25202036': 1, '4418481': 1, '19597088': 1, '26313774': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
