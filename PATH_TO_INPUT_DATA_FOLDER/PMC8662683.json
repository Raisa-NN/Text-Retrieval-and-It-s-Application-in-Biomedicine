Immediately after the surgery, she experienced shoulder and elbow paralysis and hoarseness. Examination indicated severe upper trunk plexopathy, brachial plexus injury with upper trunk rupture, and right recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. She was referred to Sina Hospital, Tehran, Iran in winter 2020 after 30 sessions of unsuccessful physiotherapy to reconstruct.\\nAll the procedures and possible outcomes discussed and she and her parents signed informed consents to start reconstructive treatments. During first surgery, through medial proximal right arm incision, nerve fascicles transferred from the ulnar nerve to the biceps brachii of the musculocutaneous nerve and from the median nerve to the brachialis branch of the musculocutaneous nerve ().\\nAbout three weeks later, in the second surgery, via posterior approach, with a transverse incision in upper scapula border the spinal accessory nerve was transferred to the suprascapularis nerve under the microscope coaptation (). Next, through an incision of posterior arm, the radial branch of the long head of the triceps brachii was identified using the nerve stimulator and eliciting triceps muscle contraction, and this nerve was transferred to the anterior branch of the axillary nerve under the microscope (). She had been under strict nerve stimulation and physiotherapy for about 4 months and fortunately gained most of shoulder and elbow activities accordingly.", "age": "[[15.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'7604091': 1, '16701009': 1, '18971731': 1, '17973214': 1, '34912676': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
