The patient had a family history of TN; both her father and sister reported having the condition of the clinical exam hyperesthesia in the left V2 and V3 was demonstrated. An MRI exam showed vascular compression of the cisternal portion of the left trigeminal nerve. Oral medication had no effect on the patient\u2019s symptoms. Trigeminal nerve microvascular decompression was performed. Surgical findings: arachnoid adhesions were found at the cerebellopontine angle. We observed compression of the trigeminal nerve by the SUCA. We placed Teflon sponges in the areas of contact. Five months after the procedure, the patient presents with the same symptoms as well as left hemifacial hyperesthesia. A re-intervention was performed. Surgical findings: We found multiple arachnoid adhesions, and a misplaced Teflon sponge. The Teflon sponge is replaced. Following the surgery, the patient reports no further pain.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17690851': 1, '21128738': 1, '23771276': 1, '3975754': 1, '34000891': 1, '2301931': 1, '31069052': 1, '29201285': 1, '32923920': 1, '31928344': 2, '28347576': 1, '3750201': 1, '29867726': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7366428-1': 1, '7366428-2': 1, '7366428-3': 1, '7366428-4': 1, '7366428-5': 1, '7366428-6': 1, '7366428-7': 1, '7366428-8': 1, '7366428-9': 1, '7366428-10': 1}"}
