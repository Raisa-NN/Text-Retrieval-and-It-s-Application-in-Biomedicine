The neurological examination showed a left hemiplegia (MRC 2/5) with the right-sided neurological weakness without sensory abnormalities. The Preoperative Nurick Grade was V.\\nThe CT [ and ] and MR [] studies showed cervical ankylosis with a severe retro-odontoid pannus and craniocervical stenosis with myelomalacia. There was also a fracture of the anterior syndesmophytes at the C2\u2013C3 level (e.g., indicative of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis [Forestier disease]).\\nThe patient underwent an urgent posterior C0\u2013C5 arthrodesis with C1 and C2 laminectomy and bilateral lateral mass screws at C1, C3, C4, and C5 levels and with bilateral pars screws at C2 []. The procedure went uneventful.\\nThe postoperative course was uneventful and the neurological symptoms improved rapidly with normalization of strength in the right arm and leg and a clear improvement in the left arm and leg (MRC 4/5). Within 3 weeks, he was able to walk independently (i.e. Nurick Grade II).\\nPostoperative imaging [] showed an excellent craniocervical decompression with pannus regression and adequate fusion.", "age": "[[79.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16925083': 1, '17120898': 1, '24048650': 1, '16382308': 1, '19179910': 1, '11358595': 1, '32494387': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
