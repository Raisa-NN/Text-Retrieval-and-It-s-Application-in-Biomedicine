The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging which revealed findings concerning for malignancy. Biopsy revealed prostate cancer w/Gleason score of eight. To evaluate for metastatic disease, both computed tomography (CT) chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone scintigraphy were ordered. The CT report commented on a bony lesion in the right ileum with no lymphadenopathy. Bone scan showed diffuse uptake consistent with osseous metastatic disease, Paget\u2019s disease, and degenerative disease. Due to the increased sensitivity of the bone scan, the patient was able to be started on the appropriate medications and has responded well to therapy.", "age": "[[87.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'3181194': 1, '24003400': 2, '7629588': 1, '24163523': 2, '981622': 1, '9031768': 1, '981663': 1, '32939203': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3800309-1': 1, '3759312-1': 1}"}
