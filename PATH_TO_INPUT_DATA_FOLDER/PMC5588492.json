The patient was noted to be in severe shock despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. Initial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed severe metabolic acidosis (pH: 6.725, PaCO2: 13.6 mmHg, HCO3: 1.7 mmol/l), but the lactate level was too high to measure (using Rapidlab 1265-SIEMENS\u2122). She was given intravenous sodium bicarbonate (bolus followed by infusion), and repeat ABG after an hour showed pH of 7.005 with bicarbonate of 4.6 mmol/L []. Due to persistent metabolic acidosis with severe hyperlactatemia, renal replacement therapy was initiated. After initial dialysis, pH improved to 7.179 with a measurable ABG lactate of 21.72 mmol/L. Dialysis was continued and lactate got reduced to 13.98 mmol/L in <24 h. The patient also had hypoglycemia requiring dextrose infusion. Complete hemogram done showed pancytopenia, and ultrasound abdomen revealed enlarged kidneys which was similar to earlier computer tomography report. With the above features, Type B lactic acidosis, secondary to malignancy, was considered as a possible etiology, and \u0101 hematologist was consulted and bone marrow biopsy was performed. Over the next 48 h, the patient's hemodynamic and clinical status improved and was extubated. Bone marrow biopsy revealed lymphoma.", "age": "[[21.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'1935152': 1, '17120408': 1, '4522886': 1, '17510092': 1, '9387092': 1, '15621814': 1, '11745277': 1, '8712068': 1, '20069124': 1, '1901099': 1, '28904487': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
