The patient had undergone laser treatment and intravitreal preserved triamcinolone acetonide injection for clinically significant diabetic macular edema in the right eye 4 years previously. Anterior segment examination revealed a posterior chamber intraocular lens with no other remarkable findings. Mild non-proliferative diabetic retinal changes were present in both eyes. The right eye showed focal laser scars in the macula and several shiny refractile crystalline deposits []. Optical coherence tomography localized these deposits to the posterior hyaloid []. These deposits were isofluorescent and not associated with specific angiographic abnormalities []. The patient has been followed for two additional years without any change in the visual acuity or status of the macula. Although a posterior vitreous separation has not developed, the crystals have been observed to migrate slowly in distribution.", "age": "[[59.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17006679': 1, '20547944': 1, '26688764': 2, '23685493': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4672105-1': 1}"}
