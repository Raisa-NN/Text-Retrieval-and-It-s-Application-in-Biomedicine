J. is a 3-year-old boy who presented with 28 months history of constipation. He passed meconium after 24 h but within 48 h. Constipation was noticed from 6 months of live. Initially, bowel motions were 2\u20133 times a week but reduced to once per week (and only after castor oil administration). The patient strains at defecation had associated significant abdominal distension with colic. There is also a failure to thrive despite intact appetite. Examination showed the abdomen was distended with normoactive bowel sounds. Digital rectal examination was unremarkable. Full-thickness rectal biopsy confirmed Hirschsprung's disease and barium enema (done before the biopsy) showed the transition zone in the sigmoid colon. The patient was optimized for surgery and had LATEP. He had uneventful postoperative period and he was discharged postoperative day 5.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26662159': 1, '26269680': 1, '20099775': 1, '19019295': 1, '26566484': 1, '24973940': 1, '22182845': 1, '21478586': 1, '17336194': 1, '32165842': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7041351-1': 2}"}
