Her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) had declined from 1.0 (20/20) to 0.4 (20/50). Further examination revealed CNV with serous retinal detachment (Fig. ). She was treated with as-needed injections for 2 years; however, she experienced a recurrence during which her vision deteriorated to 0.2 (20/100). Therefore, we switched to a bimonthly regimen that continued for 6 years. No recurrence was noted during that time, and her left visual acuity remained 0.2 (20/100). In total, the patient received 34 anti-VEGF injections in 8 years (bevacizumab \u00d7 2, pegaptanib \u00d7 2, ranibizumab \u00d7 11, aflibercept \u00d7 19, in that order).\\nThe patient\u2019s central visual field was assessed using the mean deviation (MD) value on a Humphrey field analyser with a 10\u20132 SITA standard program (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA). The MD values decreased similarly in both eyes (Fig. ). The slope of the MD values during the 8-year treatment period was \u2212 0.68 dB/year in the right eye (without CNV) and \u2212 0.32 dB/year in the left eye (with CNV). Although her peripheral visual field loss was noted to have progressed based on Goldmann perimetry tests, her visual field in the left eye was preserved even after 8 years (Fig. ). No serious adverse events were observed during treatment.", "age": "[[56.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23093773': 1, '17113430': 1, '20885857': 1, '20049508': 1, '25925748': 2, '33461530': 1, '29180701': 1, '19274531': 1, '34828423': 1, '11045344': 1, '30217183': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4482192-1': 1}"}
