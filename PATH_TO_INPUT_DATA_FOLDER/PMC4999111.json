Physical examination revealed erythematous annular\\npapules and plaques with a pigmented and atrophic central area on both thighs.\\nLaboratory tests showed normal blood counts without eosinophilia, ANA (-), ENA (-).\\nGiven the persistence and increasing size of the lesions, extending to the forearms\\nand frontal and posterior surfaces of both thighs and legs, a skin biopsy was\\nperformed. Histopathological findings included dermal edema, interstitial and\\nperivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes and eosinophils, and mast cell increase, all\\nconsistent with urticaria. An ad hoc diet was instated for one\\nmonth, together with antihistamine and oral prednisone (1mg/Kg). Initially, a good\\nresponse to corticosteroids with a reduction of skin lesion sizes was observed, but\\na relapse shortly thereafter was recorded. Hence, hydroxychloroquine 50mg/day was\\ninitiated. The patient responded favorably, but presented a new outbreak (). A second skin biopsy was performed,\\nshowing a dense, superficial and deep perivascular inflammatory infiltrate composed\\nof lymphocytes and abundant eosinophils, without \u00a8flame figures\u00a8 consistent with\\neosinophilic annular erythema ().\\nCurrently, the patient is under maintenance doses of hydroxychloroquine (50mg/day)\\nwith a sustained, positive clinical response.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'32930857': 1, '21920240': 1, '11319382': 1, '22731886': 1, '21411048': 1, '20738966': 1, '27579748': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
