Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a 25-mm enhanced nodule in the middle to inferior portion of the CBD accompanied by proximal dilatation of the bile duct (fig. ). Tumor markers such as DUPAN-2 and SPAN-1 were increased to 9,700 and 160 U/ml, respectively. Carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were within normal limits. ERCP, intraductal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed that the nodule was papillary, accompanied by PBM (fig. ). In transpapillary histological biopsy, a papillary structure with edematous interstitial tissue was observed. Plasmacyte and lymphocyte migration was observed, but neoplastic lesions and epithelial dysplasia were not identified. No atypical cells were identified in cytological specimens of bile juice. Considering the findings of PBM, we suspected bile duct neoplasms, including bile duct cancer or IPNB. We performed pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD). Macroscopically, we found a 6-mm polyp in the middle CBD (fig. ). Gallstones were not found. Microscopically, we identified a normal ductal structure with multiple plasmacyte migration (fig. ). Immunostaining did not show proliferation of p53-positive or MIB-1-positive cells. The patient was finally diagnosed with an inflammatory polyp in the CBD accompanied by PBM.", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'14534681': 1, '22722902': 1, '12143235': 1, '5548431': 1, '3956441': 1, '21160820': 1, '1161661': 1, '25969675': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
