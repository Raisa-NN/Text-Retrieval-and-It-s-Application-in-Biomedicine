Digital rectal examination revealed a palpable mass extended for 3 cm on the right-anterior wall of the rectum, 5 cm away from the anal verge.\\nInvestigating patient's clinical history and his sexual preferences, we knew he had no relevant medical history, had an ongoing homosexual relationship, and denied recent unsafe sexual behaviour.\\nAn urgent colonoscopy was arranged and confirmed a single large ulcerated lesion, occupying one-third of the visceral circumference; biopsy specimens were sent for histological analysis.\\nThe patient underwent a complete staging in the suspect of rectal malignancy; the computed tomography was negative for metastases to thoracic and abdominal parenchymal organs. The MRI showed a pathological, 2 cm deep thickening of the rectal wall, starting at 4 cm from the anal verge and extended proximally for about 6 cm, with a possible infiltrative behaviour to the mesorectal fat and significant postcontrast signal enhancement but no hyper intensity in the diffusion-weighted images (b = 800, 1000); two centimetric lymphadenopathies were also identified in the perirectal fat, a possible expression of nodal metastases. A Positron Emission Tomography reported a focal [F-18]FDG accumulation in the rectal wall, expression of a lesion with high glucose metabolism, and in five spots in the mesorectal space, suggestive for nodal spread.\\nAt last a transanal ultrasound was performed and documented a uT3 level of invasion and an N+ involvement, without involvement of levator ani muscle.\\nNo evidence of neoplastic cells was found in bioptic specimen; subsequently the patient underwent two more endoscopic procedures with extensive sampling of the ulcerated lesion, always obtaining the result of a chronic inflammatory process, with a negative research for HSV 1/2, CMV, and HHV-8 antigens.\\nOnly at this point the patient was screened for genitourinary infectious diseases; he was positive for syphilis on serological testing, and Warthin-Starry stain allowed direct visualization of spirochetes on biopsy specimen; thus diagnosis of rectal syphilitic ulcer was made.\\nThe patient was then addressed to the Infectious Diseases Division where he was treated with 2.4 mega units of Benzathine Penicillin with subsequent complete remission of the disease.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20191023': 2, '16702449': 1, '21437679': 1, '33628227': 1, '21607150': 1, '16326843': 1, '18936624': 1, '16224168': 2, '12039830': 1, '34544383': 1, '20872077': 1, '19895599': 1, '30159159': 2, '15054187': 1, '18313998': 1, '26451271': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2779291-1': 1, '2824876-1': 1, '6109197-1': 1}"}
