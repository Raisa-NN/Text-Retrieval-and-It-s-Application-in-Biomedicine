FAF imaging revealed hyperautofluorescent lesion with central hypoautofluorescence [Fig. and ]. NIR imaging revealed hyperreflective lesion with a hyporeflective halo [Fig. and ]. EDI-OCT [Fig. and ] showed lobulated hypo/isoreflective choroidal lesion with loss of vascular pattern and dome-shaped elevation of the overlying retina. Characteristic \u201cincreased transmission effect\u201d was seen beneath the lesion. A small cap of subretinal fluid at the apex of lesion was noted in the right eye. Antituberculous therapy resulted in systemic improvement and regression of choroidal tubercles [Figs. and -].", "age": "[[39.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20597103': 1, '27347644': 1, '27726520': 1, '25105317': 1, '23246121': 1, '25932546': 1, '31492008': 1, '28513488': 1, '29941748': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
