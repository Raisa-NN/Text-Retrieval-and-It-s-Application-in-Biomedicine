Three-dimensional angiomesenteric computed tomography (3D-AMCT) showed five fusiform and saccular aneurysms in her inferior PDA, dorsal pancreatic, and transverse pancreatic arteries (Figures and ). The aneurysms were managed by open surgical resection and anastomosis and clipping. The CA stenosis was left in situ. Pathologic examination of the resected aneurysm showed fibrosis and myxoid degeneration of the arterial wall. Follow-up 3D-AMCT was performed at 6-month to 1-year intervals until 66 months postoperative but showed no evidence of aneurysm recurrence with unchanged CA stenosis. Notably, the collapsed common hepatic and splenic arterial take-off segments were reconstituted from the immediate postoperative follow-up (Figures and ).", "age": "[[37.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18756691': 1, '16936911': 1, '3701947': 1, '2653973': 1, '21315542': 1, '17913522': 1, '28238917': 1, '22578409': 1, '8985299': 1, '31275470': 1, '28479427': 1, '30367314': 1, '28746184': 1, '8464103': 1, '17276102': 1, '26366387': 2, '26404648': 1, '28815097': 2, '16701092': 1, '31126761': 1, '23880423': 1, '17559685': 1, '27868061': 1, '11752963': 1, '32596287': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5549485-1': 1, '4559620-1': 1}"}
