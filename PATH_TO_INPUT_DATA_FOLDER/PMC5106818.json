The patient had been vaccinated against Yellow Fever. At medical examination, no other symptoms and signs were recognized. Laboratory tests showed leukopenia (leukocyte count 3.5 \u00d7 109 cells/L, range 4.00\u201310.80 \u00d7 109 cells/L) with lymphopenia (lymphocytes 11.0 %, range 20.0\u201340.0 %) only. Pregnancy test was negative. An indirect immunofluorescence assay resulted negative (<1:20 for both IgM and IgG) for ZIKV and Chikungunya, while IgG titer for Dengue Virus was weakly positive, probably because of cross-reactivity with previous yellow fever vaccination. RT-PCR for Flavivirus genus resulted positive both in serum and urine, samples were sequenced and ZIKV was confirmed. The patient received a counseling about potential of ZIKV sexual transmission, the need to delay a possible pregnancy and appropriate methods to reduce this risk. The symptoms resolved spontaneously in one day. A follow up ZIKV serologic testing, performed at day 11 after symptoms onset was positive for both IgM (1:80) and IgG (1:160), pan-flavivirus RT-PCR was negative on serum whereas was still positive on urine (see Table ).\\nFor all patients, the presence of ZIKV-specific neutralising antibodies in serum samples was also confirmed by a virus neutralization assay.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12995440': 1, '15664052': 1, '18020965': 1, '31041548': 1, '18445417': 1, '27171034': 1, '24721538': 1, '18605910': 1, '31337150': 1, '26859285': 1, '26866485': 1, '26796813': 1, '24507467': 1, '25818036': 1, '24739982': 1, '21900425': 1, '27835966': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5106818-1': 2, '5106818-2': 2}"}
