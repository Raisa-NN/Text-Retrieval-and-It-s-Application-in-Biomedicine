She had no history of ovarian or thyroid disease. Physical examination revealed slight abdominal distension with no palpable pelvic mass or signs of ascites. The serum tumor marker, cancer antigen (CA)-125, was slightly increased at 4 IU/ml (reference value <35 IU/ml). Her pregnancy test was negative. Pelvic ultrasound revealed a right-solid cystic ovarian mass measuring 2.5 \u00d7 5.0 \u00d7 8.0 cm with intracystic vegetations ().\\nExploratory laparotomy by a Pfannenstiel incision found a multiloculated complex right- cystic ovarian mass. The left ovary and the rest of the abdomen appeared to be free of disease. Subsequently, a right ovarian cystectomy was performed (). Her postoperative course was uneventful and was discharged on day 2. Histopathological analysis of the surgical specimen revealed a cystic wall with thyroid follicles containing irregular and encapsulated colloid, confirming the diagnosis of a benign SO. Eight months of follow-up with ultrasonography and CA-125 at regular intervals has shown no evidence of recurrence.", "age": "[[27.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15350384': 1, '10366477': 1, '9062167': 1, '9922205': 1, '2404159': 1, '26997461': 1, '17196426': 1, '8253550': 1, '19471561': 1, '33343869': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
