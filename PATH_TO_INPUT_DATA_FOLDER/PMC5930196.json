Previous ultrasound in first trimester was normal. History and physical examination were unremarkable. She defaulted before further evaluation, but represented to us 5-months after vaginal delivery in a secondary hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was then performed and showed Bosniak IV complex cystic left renal mass (Fig. ) necessitating left radical nephrectomy a month thereafter (Fig. ). Histology confirmed multilocular cystic RCC of low malignant potential (T3a, N0, M0). She was counseled on contraception and is still on routine follow-up in our urology out-patient clinic, 30-months after the nephrectomy.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28326245': 2, '12770739': 1, '10751870': 1, '19280497': 1, '27408760': 1, '23624999': 1, '28979646': 1, '26945939': 1, '29744074': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5345512-1': 1}"}
