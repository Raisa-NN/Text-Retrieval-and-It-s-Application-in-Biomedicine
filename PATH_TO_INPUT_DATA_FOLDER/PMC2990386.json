The abdominal computerized tomography showed a nodular tumor-like lesion on the upper left pole of the kidney. Partial nephrectomy was performed. The surgical specimen weighted 78,0 g and measured 5,5 \u00d7 4,5 \u00d7 2,5 cm. On gross examination, there was a poorly circumscribed yellow soft nodule with central degeneration, measuring 3,0 \u00d7 2,0 \u00d7 2,0 cm.\\nMicroscopically there was a suppurative chronic intersticial nephritis with a lymphoid and neutrophilic infiltrate, central necrotic zone surrounded by foamy macrophages and giant multinucleated cells, tubular atrophy, periglomerular fibrosis and global glomerular sclerosis. The inflammatory process has extended to the medulla and perinephric fat. Next to the central necrotic zone were several spherical laminated rings admixed with macrophages (). These ring-like laminated structures resembled psammoma bodies or an ova of a parasite. The rings had an amorphous, central core surrounded by a double layered wall, accentuated with PAS () and negative von Kossa, Grocott and trichrome stains. Under polarized light the rings were nonbirefringent. The findings were diagnostic of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis with Liesegang rings.", "age": "[[51.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16311365': 1, '1950318': 1, '19627542': 1, '2956899': 1, '10647674': 1, '16586244': 1, '2387210': 1, '3418229': 1, '19274580': 1, '11138554': 1, '24917755': 1, '23094171': 2, '2061888': 1, '3341276': 1, '10834005': 1, '21151725': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3474220-1': 1}"}
