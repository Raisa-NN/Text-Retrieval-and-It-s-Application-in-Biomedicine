During endoscopy, she was found to have a one centimeter subepithelial, white nodular lesion in the distal part of the esophagus, 30 cm from the oral cavity, which was further evaluated by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS; see Figure ).\\nFurther evaluation using EUS confirmed the presence of a 10.3 x 6 mm well-demarcated hypoechoic lesion confined to the submucosa without invasion into the muscularis propria (Figure ).\\nThe lesion was successfully resected en bloc by a cap-assisted EMR technique (Figure ).\\nThe mucosal defect was subsequently closed with three endoclips. Careful observation of the excised specimen confirmed the complete removal of the lesion. The cross-section was composed of pink polypoid tissue measuring 0.9 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 0.5 cm in volume. A microscopic analysis revealed large polygonal cells with abundant granular cytoplasm. Cytoplasm, as well as the cell nuclei, showed diffuse Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) positivity. The immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis exhibited strong reactivity for S-100 protein, thus confirming the GCT diagnosis (Figure ).\\nInformed consent has been obtained from the patient.
