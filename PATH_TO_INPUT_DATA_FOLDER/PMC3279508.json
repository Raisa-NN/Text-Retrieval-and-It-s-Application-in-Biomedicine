Chest radiography disclosed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and air-space consolidation in at both lung fields and a 5 x 3 cm soft tissue lesion at left apex (). A 12-lead ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm without ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities.

All remaining laboratory examinations were normal. After admission, brain CT was arranged and it showed neither abnormal intracranial hemorrhage nor density change except brain atrophy. Twenty-four-hour Holter ECG was checked for arrhythmia related syncope and the results showed sinus rhythm with scattered atrial/ventricular premature beats.
