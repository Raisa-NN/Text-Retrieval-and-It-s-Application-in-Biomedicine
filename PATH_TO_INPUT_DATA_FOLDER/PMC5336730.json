His LVEF was 29%. He had already been treated with coronary artery bypass grafting and heart failure therapy comprising \u00df-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics. ECG revealed a sinus rhythm (61 beats/min), which was not eligible for cardiac resynchronization therapy. Holter ECG demonstrated intermittent sinus bradycardia and rare sinus-atrial blocks.\\nThus, a dual-chamber ICD was indicated for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death and for antibradycardiac pacing. During the ICD implant procedure, intraoperative phlebography revealed that the patient had PLSVC with an absence of the right SVC (). The dual-chamber ICD was successfully implanted. Optimizer implantation with three leads was performed 6 weeks later through the right subclavian vein and PLSVC. Peri- and post-procedural device interrogation revealed no cross talk.\\nFollow-up data at 4 years after implantation revealed a mild increase in LVEF (33%) and a significant improvement of dyspnea symptoms (NYHA II). Spiroergometry revealed an improvement in peak oxygen uptake from 10.4 mL/kg/min at baseline to 13.6 mL/kg/min at last follow-up. During follow-ups, the patient felt well without any cardiac decompensation and need for hospitalization because of cardiac issues.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22948517': 1, '15100109': 1, '18270213': 1, '24265466': 1, '24975782': 1, '25662055': 1, '23801822': 1, '22611136': 1, '13208900': 1, '21315216': 1, '26898253': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
