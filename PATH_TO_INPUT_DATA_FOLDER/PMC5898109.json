CT of the head revealed a 1 cm mixed density lesion, associated with 1.5 cm midline shift and effacement of the basal cisterns. Unfortunately, she had been given 1 mg IV hydromorphone for headaches before the scan, and subsequently deteriorated, becoming obtunded with a right fixed, dilated pupil. She was promptly intubated, and 50 g of mannitol was given. Her exam improved \u2013 pupils were reactive bilaterally, and she was following simple commands in all four extremities. Although initial International Normalized Ratio was 9, this was corrected to 1.3. A repeat CT of the head was similar to the prior scan, except for a new \u201cDuret\u201d hemorrhage in the pons, suggesting a herniation event []. Drainage was recommended, and consent was obtained for the off-label use of the Integra Camino bolt []. Once the device was applied, approximately 40 ml of chronic-appearing blood was cumulatively collected. A follow-up CT of the head revealed near complete resolution of the midline shift and a significant contraction of the chronic component of the subdural collection, from 10 to 5 mm in the axial plane []. Following extubation, the patient exhibited an intact neurological exam. Her headache also improved. She was discharged home on postprocedure day 10 and promptly returned to work within 2 weeks. At 3 months, complete resolution of the right SDH was noted on a follow-up scan [].", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20001585': 1, '16408582': 1, '10048060': 1, '21909694': 1, '23259822': 1, '12810784': 1, '23485050': 1, '24785319': 1, '12748020': 1, '29682038': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5898109-1': 2}"}
