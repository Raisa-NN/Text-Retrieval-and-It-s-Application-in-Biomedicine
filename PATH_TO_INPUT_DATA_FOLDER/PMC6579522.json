Color Doppler ultrasonography revealed a large nodule posterior to the left carotid bifurcation and ligature of the right common carotid artery that had been performed during a previous surgical procedure. The patient was nevertheless asymptomatic neurologically. Arteriography ( A) identified a hypervascularized glomus tumor with a maximum diameter of 5 cm, located posterior to the left carotid bifurcation and primarily fed by the ascending pharyngeal artery, in addition to occlusion of the right carotid artery ( 11D). Furthermore, a 4 mm saccular aneurysm was observed involving the left ophthalmic artery. The patient reported having had dermatological surgery previously in the right cervical area, which had involved complications causing her to be admitted to intensive care. However, she had no report or history providing details of that event. Having diagnosed the glomus tumor and contralateral carotid occlusion on the basis of imaging findings, the decision was taken to perform resection of the tumor after preoperative embolization.\\nEmbolization was conducted by infusion of the Onyx\u00ae copolymer embolic agent (Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA) 2 days before surgery, via superselective catheterization of the artery feeding the tumor, located at the carotid bifurcation.\\nThe \u201cpressure cooker\u201d technique ( \\n ) was employed via a femoral artery puncture, with selective catheterization of the left common carotid artery ( A). Next, a 1.3-F Marathon\u00ae microcatheter (Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA) was positioned in the ascending pharyngeal artery, occluding the proximal region. A 1.5-F Apollo \u00ae microcatheter (Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA) was then positioned distal of the Marathon\u00ae catheter. The Apollo\u00ae microcatheter has a mechanically detachable distal tip. It was used to inject Onyx\u00ae until arterial reflux was identified on fluoroscopy ( B). Next, Gluebran\u00ae was injected via the 1.3-F microcatheter to secure the tip of the Apollo\u00ae microcatheter and achieve arterial occlusion to prevent reflux into the carotid artery. Once the ascending pharyngeal artery had been obstructed, infusion of copolymer was resumed via the Marathon\u00ae catheter, to progress in the anterograde direction and fill the hypervascularized lesion ( 33C). Since the hypervascularized tumor had not been completely filled ( C) by endovascular embolization, the unfilled part of the glomus tumor was directly punctured, percutaneously with a 22G needle, guided by the roadmap and fluoroscopy, and percutaneous polymer embolization was used to fill the remaining space ( \\n , D).\\nThree days after embolization, surgical excision was performed through the longitudinal cervical incision typical of carotid endarterectomy, exposing an enlarged ganglion with a great deal of adherent tissues and signs of inflammation. After identification and isolation of arteries and nerves, a tumor with approximate dimensions of 3 cm x 2 cm was dissected without major bleeding or arterial damage, the dissection planes were identified, and rigorous hemostasis was achieved by ligation of the tumoral vessels and the ascending pharyngeal artery ( ). After excision, a soft silicone vacuum drain was attached and the dissection planes were drawn together. The results of pathology and immunohistochemical assays provided evidence of a paraganglioma with follicular lymphoid hyperplasia and reaction pattern.\\nInitially, during the immediate postoperative period, systemic pressure was difficult to control, with hypertensive peaks, and intensive monitoring was needed for 5 days. After this period, the patient began to recover gradually, with a reduced need for antihypertensives, and was discharged 7 days after the surgical procedure. The late postoperative period went well, with no neurological events, good wound healing, no stenosis or expansive lesions, and no swellings. Imaging exams conducted as part of a reevaluation 3 years after the procedure did not show any sign of relapse whatsoever ( ).", "age": "[[64.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'10849634': 1, '22090179': 1, '3950716': 1, '5127724': 1, '2218758': 1, '24426745': 1, '4343508': 1, '6245477': 1, '22079824': 1, '14835205': 1, '31934642': 1, '26019391': 1, '23730577': 1, '31236106': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
