The patient works in a financial company. She has been smoking 10 cigarettes per day for 11 years. She only drinks alcohol occasionally. The medical history was free. The dental history was free apart from routine dental procedures, such as fillings and prosthetics. The patient was 64 kg weight and 164 cm height. The burn incident, as described by the patient, happened the moment she bit and chewed a near the center of the pie part, which caused her extreme pain before she could spit the bite out. The still remaining cheese elements in the mouth cavity prolonged the feeling of pain, as they remained extremely hot. The clinical examination that followed revealed erosive lesions of the lateral palate. The lesions could be described as oval-shaped or circular pattern erosions, with erythematous borders surrounding whitish damaged mucosa (Figure. , ).\\nThe recommended treatment included 0.12% chlorhexidine mouth-rinse for one week and preventive measurements. It was suggested to avoid smoking and drinking or eating very hot and acidic foods (vinegar, lemon juice, e.t.c) and alcohol. On the other hand, it was recommended to drink non-carbonized cold fluids and to brush carefully the teeth without injuring the erosive areas.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'10439160': 1, '15808175': 1, '7360215': 1, '30736423': 1, '8909750': 1, '9232290': 1, '18826623': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
