The pain was aggravated by breathing. Physical examination revealed maximal pain and tenderness in the RUQ of the abdomen. No pain and tenderness were observed in the lower abdomen. The vital signs were stable without fever. The blood test results were unremarkable, except for the C-reactive protein levels (21 mg/dL). Urinalysis detected 10-20 leucocytes. Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) in the RUQ abdomen and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) were performed sequentially (). On POCUS, no abnormal findings were observed in the gallbladder, hepatic parenchyma, and right pleural space. On the other hand, in the right subcostal scan, the hepatic capsule was observed to be abnormally bright and thickened (). According to the scan angle and the patient\u2019s respiration, the thickened hepatic capsule was observed as three layers (hyperechoic layer-hypoechoic layer-hyperechoic layer; ). In the arterial phase of the CECT, hepatic capsular enhancements were observed on the right side of the liver (). The patient was diagnosed as having FHCS on the basis of her symptoms, physical examination, and imaging findings. She was treated in accordance with the PID treatment guidelines. After 3 days of oral antibiotic therapy, she visited the outpatient clinic without symptoms. The treatment was completed without complications.", "age": "[[18.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8405645': 1, '17235003': 1, '15055246': 1, '12016380': 1, '31620583': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
