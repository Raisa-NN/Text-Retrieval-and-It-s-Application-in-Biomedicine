There was no significant family history of hematologic disease, and on clinical examination he was found to have massive splenomegaly, mild hepatomegaly, and cervical lymphadenopathy. A complete blood count showed leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and that myeloblasts accounted for 1% of all nucleated cells, as shown in Table . Examination of bone marrow aspirate revealed that it was hypercellular with granulocytic proliferation and a decreased ratio of megakaryocytes, while myeloblasts were not substantially increased in number. Analysis of a peripheral blood sample revealed negativity for the BCR/ABL fusion gene, while a molecular study investigating genes often shown to be aberrant in JMML showed a mutation in somatic KRAS.\\nThe patient received 2 courses of protocol contained homoharringtonine and cytarabine (homoharringtonine 2.5 mg/m2 for 7 consecutive days, cytarabine 40 mg/m2 for 7 consecutive days) and 3 courses of a decitabine protocol (20 mg/m2 over 1 hour intravenously (i.v.) for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 4 weeks). The patient suffered from platelet transfusion refractoriness, and was then transferred to the pediatric surgery department, where a splenectomy was performed. There were no complications after the operation, and approximately 2 weeks later he had a good response to platelet transfusion. Eleven months after the diagnosis, the patient underwent haploidentical stem cell transplantation from his mother, with a 4-human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA)-mismatched umbilical cord stem cell sample used for complementary therapy. The conditioning regimen administered to the patient was myeloablative, including busulfan (4.8 mg/kg/d i.v. for 4 days), cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/d for 2 days), F-ATG (5 mg/kg/d i.v. for 3 days), and melphalan (140 mg/m2/d i.v. for 1 day). The numbers of CD34+ cells and monocytes infused during transplantation were 5.0 \u00d7 106/kg and 6.6 \u00d7 108/kg, respectively, while the umbilical cord blood stem cells infused were 1.65 \u00d7 105/kg of CD34+ cells and 7.2 \u00d7 107/kg of monocytes. The prophylaxis to combat GVHD included methotrexate (15 mg/m2 on day 1 and 10 mg/m2 on days 3, 5, and 11), cyclosporine (3 mg/kg/d during the conditioning regimen), and mycophenolate mofetil (250 mg orally bid from day 1 to day 44). Neutrophil engraftment was noted on day 14, with platelet engraftment seen on day 16. On day 20, the patient's total blood cells were 99.73% donor cells, and by day 30, a test to detect the KRAS mutation was negative. One month after HSCT, the patient developed grade I GVHD of the skin on day 58 in the form of an erythematous rash, which responded to oral methyl-prednisolone (4 mg orally bid). Two months after the transplant, we administered decitabine prophylactically (20 mg/m2 over 1 hour i.v. once a month) to guard against disease relapse. Twenty-six months after transplantation, the patient's blood tests were normal, the molecular genetic analyses were negative for mutations, and complete chimerism was observed.", "age": "[[10.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27322988': 1, '28179213': 1, '15353481': 1, '11960345': 1, '26720758': 1, '23926304': 1, '22976832': 1, '25564399': 1, '24322499': 1, '24734223': 1, '19299654': 1, '25163700': 1, '27913534': 1, '18397212': 1, '33327329': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
