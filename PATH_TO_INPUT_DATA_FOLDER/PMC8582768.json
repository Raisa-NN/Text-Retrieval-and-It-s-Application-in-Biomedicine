The past medical history was significant for schizoaffective disorder; tobacco use disorder; constipation; vitamin D deficiency; and metabolic syndrome characterized by obesity, dyslipidemia, and prediabetes. Current medications included clozapine 150 mg by mouth at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily, docusate 100 mg by mouth twice daily, and cholecalciferol 2000 units by mouth daily. He tried and failed multiple antipsychotics prior to initiation of clozapine 4 years ago. His mental health had been stable since initiating clozapine, and he resides in a group home. He gained 9.5 kg the year after clozapine was initiated, and then weight stabilized. He had difficulty controlling his diet at the group home and ate what was prepared for him. Despite lifestyle education, he continued to visit the vending machine frequently for soda (2 cans per day), candy bars (1 per day), and chips (1 bag per day). He was referred to a dietitian but was unable to successfully implement dietary changes. He did not have access to exercise equipment at his group home and did not walk outside due to inclement weather. He was referred to an exercise program located in the same facility as the clozapine clinic but did not attend the appointments. Metformin initiation for weight management and prediabetes was recommended at several appointments, but he declined because he preferred not to take more medications. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day and was not interested in smoking cessation services.\\nHis resting BP was elevated at his past 2 appointments (136/84 and 136/86 mm Hg), so the nurse at his group home had been recording daily BP readings in a log. His BP log revealed an average BP of 138/86 mm Hg. Pertinent vital signs and fasting laboratory results from the appointment were as follows: height: 5 feet, 10 inches; weight: 104.5 kg; BMI: 33 kg/m2; BP: 138/88 mm Hg; pulse: 79 bpm; hemoglobin A1c = 6%; TC = 225 mg/dL; LDL = 136 mg/dL; triglycerides = 395 mg/dL; HDL = 27 mg/dL; clozapine level = 132 mcg/L; norclozapine level = 135 mcg/L; white blood cell count = 8.4 thousand cells/mcl; and absolute neutrophil count = 5.1 thousand cells/mcl.\\nClozapine is considered high risk for causing increases in weight, lipids, BG, and BP. This patient had already tried and failed multiple antipsychotics, and his mental health had been stable for 4 years on clozapine. Switching to an antipsychotic with lower liability for metabolic AEs is likely not a feasible option for this patient. Lifestyle interventions are a first-line treatment approach, but the patient had been unsuccessful with altering his diet, exercising, or attempting smoking cessation. Therefore, medically treating the metabolic AEs was necessary.\\nHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are considered the cornerstone of treatment for lipid lowering due to evidence demonstrating they can prevent ASCVD. There are 4 categories of patients that may benefit from statin therapy, including those with clinical ASCVD, LDL \u2265190 mg/dL, diabetes aged 40 to 75 years, and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk score \u22657.5%. An online ASCVD risk estimator can be located at . Individuals with an ASCVD risk score of 7.5% to <20% are considered intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event, and a moderate-intensity statin can be initiated if risk enhancers favor it. Examples of risk-enhancing factors include but are not limited to metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disease (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, HIV), ethnicity (eg, South Asian ancestry), and persistently elevated triglycerides (\u2265175 mg/dL). Individuals with an ASCVD risk score \u226520% are considered high risk, and statin initiation should be considered with a goal to reduce LDL by at least 50%. Moderate-intensity statins are expected to lower the LDL by 30% to 49% and high-intensity statins by \u226550% ().\\nStatins are most effective for lowering LDL, but they can also lower triglycerides (22% to 45%) and increase HDL (5% to 10%). Fibrates and niacin are effective for reducing triglycerides but have a mild LDL-lowering effect, and there is not enough evidence to routinely support their use as add-on medications to a statin. Adding a fibrate or omega-3 fatty acids to a statin is recommended for patients with persistently elevated severe hypertriglyceridemia (\u2265500 mg/dL) to prevent pancreatitis. Fenofibrate is preferred over gemfibrozil in patients being treated with a statin due to lower risk of myopathy. The dose of the statin is another important consideration. The largest percentage of LDL lowering is achieved with the initial dose., Each doubling of the statin dose should then lead to an additional 4% to 7% reduction in LDL., Clinical experience indicates that starting statins at a low dose and titrating up does not lead to the same level of LDL lowering as starting at a moderate- to high-intensity dose. Initiation of a lower intensity statin may be considered if there is a history of statin intolerance.\\nStage 1 hypertension is defined as systolic BP 130 to 139 or diastolic BP 80 to 89 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension is defined as BP \u2265140/90 mm Hg. At least 2 resting BP readings obtained on 2 separate occasions should be used to estimate the BP. A log of home BP readings can provide a more accurate estimation of BP if proper techniques are used. For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults, nonpharmacologic therapy and treatment with an antihypertensive is recommended for individuals with stage 2 hypertension or stage 1 hypertension and a 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or higher. Initiation of 2 antihypertensive agents from different classes is recommended for individuals with stage 2 hypertension. A BP target of <130/80 mm Hg is recommended. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are first-line treatments for hypertension due to evidence demonstrating that they reduce clinical events. There is inadequate evidence to support beta blockers as a first-line treatment for hypertension in the absence of certain cardiovascular comorbidities, such as heart failure or ischemic heart disease. Patient-specific factors, such as comorbidities, concurrent medications, age, race, and medication adherence, should be taken into consideration when selecting an initial antihypertensive.\\nThe optimal treatment for hypertension in individuals with metabolic syndrome has not been clearly defined. Thiazide diuretics can increase insulin resistance and accelerate conversion to diabetes mellitus.,, They can also worsen dyslipidemia., The European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension guidelines list metabolic syndrome as a possible contraindication for use of thiazide diuretics. The ACC/AHA guidelines note that small increases in BG levels are possible but also state there are no data available demonstrating deterioration in cardiovascular outcomes in patients with metabolic syndrome who are treated with thiazide diuretics. When no compelling indications or contraindications are present to help guide treatment selection, preference may be given to an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or CCB in patients with metabolic syndrome to help avoid increases in BG. Age and race can also help with treatment selection. Thiazide diuretics and CCBs are preferred in Black adults without heart failure or chronic kidney disease because they are more effective than ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Older adults may also respond better to thiazide diuretics and CCBs due to a declining number of nephrons and lower plasma renin levels.\\nUsing an average BP of 138/86 mm Hg, the patient in this case had a 10-year ASCVD risk score of approximately 17.5%, placing him into a statin benefit group. His known risk-enhancing factors included metabolic syndrome, characterized by persistently elevated triglycerides, obesity, and elevated BP. He also smoked cigarettes. Lifestyle modifications continued to be encouraged, and a risk-benefit discussion about statin therapy was conducted. He was willing to initiate a statin and was started on atorvastatin 20 mg by mouth daily. A moderate-intensity statin was appropriate based on his 10-year ASCVD risk score. His triglycerides were elevated but not enough to warrant addition of a nonstatin therapy. His BP readings in the clinic and at home indicated he had stage 1 hypertension, and his 10-year ASCVD risk score was greater than 10%. The patient did not have any compelling indications or contraindications to help guide selection of an antihypertensive. Given his age, race, and history of metabolic syndrome, initiation of an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or CCB may be most appropriate. After review of the potential AEs associated with each medication class, the patient elected to start amlodipine 5 mg by mouth daily.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26509694': 1, '21894153': 1, '20207521': 1, '16423166': 1, '30165516': 1, '24222017': 1, '16855461': 1, '16082416': 1, '22711171': 1, '20459883': 1, '28580898': 1, '28237639': 1, '15998156': 1, '19653979': 1, '20425584': 1, '18515465': 1, '17940236': 1, '16062095': 1, '19512978': 1, '29133356': 1, '24636967': 1, '30879355': 1, '15876898': 1, '4337477': 1, '30586774': 1, '19293950': 1, '30034973': 1, '18504319': 1, '31860457': 1, '27147592': 1, '23846733': 1, '19931306': 1, '31913424': 1, '15855345': 1, '18245179': 1, '15313959': 1, '21300937': 1, '15949648': 1, '15056602': 1, '15876905': 1, '20102893': 1, '9205036': 1, '34824956': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
