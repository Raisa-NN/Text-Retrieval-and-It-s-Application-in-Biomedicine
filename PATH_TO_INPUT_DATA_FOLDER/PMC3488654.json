The original impression was intramedullary astrocytoma. The patient's motor power was intact, and pathological reflexes were not found. The outside MRI showed HSI lesion with the cord swelling at the level of 4-6th cervical spine and a focal nodular enhancement confined to dorsal segment at C5 (). The SEP study described increased latency and wave attenuation, whereas the MEP was normal. CSF findings were within the normal range, and no evidence of autoimmune disease was found. Similar to case 1, total IgE was elevated and the response to D. farinae was active in the serum study. IgG for Toxocariasis antigen was also positive. With the impression of eosinophilic myelitis by laboratory, radiological and clinical findings, steroid and albendazole were administered. Three months later, the cord HSI lesion was markedly improved in the follow-up MRI (). The clinical symptom was improved and stable for 8 months.", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12557017': 1, '11136359': 1, '33815594': 1, '10064169': 1, '19949655': 1, '2895221': 1, '20538303': 1, '11166798': 1, '19447576': 1, '28757876': 1, '16782129': 1, '29472889': 1, '17430865': 1, '27084369': 1, '23133734': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3488654-1': 2}"}
