The loin pain was associated with frank haematuria. On examination, he had severe tenderness to his left hypochondrium and renal angle. He was tachycardic and blood pressure was elevated at an average of 160/90 from a baseline of 130/80. A CT abdomen (Figures , , and ) revealed a large left sided haemorrhage surrounding the polycystic kidney which extended into the retroperitoneum. The renal lengths and volumes were 15.7 cm and 571 mL, respectively, on the right and 16.0 cm and 732 mL, respectively, on the left. He was managed supportively with intravenous fluids (0.9% sodium chloride solution, 125 mLs/h), analgesia (including paracetamol and codeine), and haemodynamic monitoring. Twelve hours after presentation his haemoglobin dropped from 132 g/L to 60 g/L with an associated fall in haematocrit, but with maintenance of blood pressure. This was treated with a blood transfusion (3 units packed red cells) and radiological embolization of the bleeding source (Figures , , and ). Renal function remained stable and the patient improved without the need for further intervention. He was advised to avoid contact sports in future and his haematuria and pain resolved within two weeks.", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26150605': 1, '2137671': 1, '8957030': 1, '3805395': 1, '30384834': 2, '8321262': 1, '11703580': 1, '9335384': 1, '1496966': 1, '22344503': 1, '31467817': 2, '31938078': 1, '29181208': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6211544-1': 1, '6706258-1': 1}"}
