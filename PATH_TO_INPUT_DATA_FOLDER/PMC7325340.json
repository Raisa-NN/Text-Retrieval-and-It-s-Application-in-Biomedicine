She had initially seen her primary care physician in the outpatient setting and was ruled out to have pulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal etiology, and was subsequently referred to cardiology clinic for evaluation of cardiac etiology for her consistent chest pain symptoms despite being on medical therapy.\\nThe patient reported progressive worsening of chest pain for a few months. She described radiation of the chest pain to jaw and left upper chest along with left upper extremity and shoulder area. She denied any specific association of pain with scale of activity and pain occasionally happened at rest as well. She was recently given nitroglycerin sublingual tablets for relief of her chest pain syndrome. Physical exam revealed normal cardiac findings with regular rate and rhythm. She had no murmurs and jugular venous pressure was not elevated. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm and left axis deviation (Figure ).\\nA chest X-ray was unremarkable for any acute cardiopulmonary process (Figure ).\\nAn echocardiogram was ordered, which showed normal left ventricular size with an estimated ejection fraction of 55%. She had concentric remodeling of the left ventricle. Echocardiogram was positive for akinesis of myocardial segments (Figure ).\\nGiven her abnormal echocardiogram and high pre-test probability of ASCVD and symptoms concerning for unstable angina, she was offered a left heart catheterization and coronary angiography to further delineate her coronary anatomy.\\nShe was brought to the catheterization laboratory in the fasting state. Coronary artery angiography and left heart catheterization were performed via right radial artery access without complications. It revealed an anomalous left main coronary artery from single right coronary ostium (Figure ).\\nIt further revealed significant obstructive multi-vessel coronary artery disease involving distal left main artery, proximal left anterior descending artery, left circumflex and right coronary arteries (Figure ).\\nThe patient had a right dominant system with absent left coronary cusp (Figure ).\\nShe had a normal left ventricular end diastolic pressure as well. She had a high Syntax score of 34, and subsequently a Heart Team approach was pursued. She had acceptable Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk, and hence was referred for multi-vessel surgical revascularization.", "age": "[[65.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'32069111': 1, '12653465': 1, '32117665': 2, '32454021': 1, '25714217': 1, '27370010': 2, '34183908': 1, '30123279': 2, '32617251': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7029822-1': 1, '6079552-1': 1, '4930572-1': 1}"}
