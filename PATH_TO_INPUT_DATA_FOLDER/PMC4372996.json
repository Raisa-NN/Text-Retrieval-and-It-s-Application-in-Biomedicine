There was no associated vomiting, diarrhea or respiratory symptoms. He ate fresh peas from the garden without a reaction. He also tolerates soy, and beans. There was a history of a similar reaction to peanut three years prior to the pea reaction, and he had been avoiding peanut since. Skin testing was positive to boiled pea (9 mm) but negative to raw pea. Skin testing to fresh peanut was borderline (2 mm). Specific IgE to peanut was 0.4 kU/L but was not done to pea. Environmental testing done at time of assessment was completely negative (including to birch). He has avoided cooked peas and peanut since assessment, and carries an epinephrine autoinjector.", "age": "[[13.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11398088': 1, '18727474': 1, '19810019': 1, '22555630': 1, '11428743': 1, '19788021': 1, '10518837': 1, '11527247': 1, '11031348': 1, '15544600': 1, '18594152': 1, '11039834': 1, '15740064': 1, '9826012': 1, '21464707': 1, '23224442': 1, '7189181': 1, '9826013': 1, '2918186': 1, '25810727': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4372996-1': 2, '4372996-2': 2, '4372996-3': 2, '4372996-4': 2}"}
