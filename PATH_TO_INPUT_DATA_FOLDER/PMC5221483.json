The patient had right-sided epiphora and discharge over a duration of 2 years. The complaints started after the patient had a road traffic accident with resultant orbital fractures of the medial wall and floor. Lacrimal evaluation was suggestive of right complete NLDO. The left lacrimal system was suggestive of a partial obstruction of the NLDO. The 3D CT DCG showed a regularly dilated right lacrimal sac and an abrupt obstruction at the level of the sac\u2013duct junction (). The DCG findings of the left lacrimal apparatus showed multiple areas of stenosis at the sac\u2013duct junction and within the nasolacrimal duct (). IGDL could obtain the precise location of the lacrimal sac in relation to the endoscopic lateral wall anatomy (). Following exposure of the presumed lacrimal tissues during the endoscopic DCR, intraoperative IGDL was able to successfully delineate the lacrimal apparatus from the surrounding areas of intense scarring (). The surgery was completed safely without any complications.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9843278': 1, '1550180': 1, '18645455': 1, '11897953': 1, '34880576': 1, '19929681': 1, '26020716': 1, '2013022': 1, '28115826': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5221483-1': 2, '5221483-2': 2}"}
