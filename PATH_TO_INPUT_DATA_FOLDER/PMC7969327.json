He had chest pain that started 30 minutes ago. He was unconscious shortly after arriving in the ED, and VF was observed on the ECG. Despite repeated defibrillation of 200J and adherence to Advanced Cardiac Life Support, VF was sustained. After the 3 times of 400J DSD, he recovered a spontaneous circulation (Fig. A,1B). ECG rhythm was arrhythmia including early ventricular contraction. Vital signs were stable (Fig. -C). After emergency coronary angiography, he was admitted to the ICU. Coronary arteriography findings were total occlusion of a left anterior descending artery and 80% tubular occlusion of a right coronary artery. He was transferred to the general ward 2 days later. On the 8th day, he was discharged home with the CPC Scale 1.", "age": "[[38.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'14411374': 1, '25970000': 1, '15451582': 1, '26848018': 1, '10825615': 1, '2301797': 1, '12479765': 1, '14987781': 1, '33081529': 1, '10486418': 1, '15457303': 1, '8214853': 1, '27077941': 1, '20956220': 1, '33725873': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7969327-1': 2, '7969327-2': 2}"}
