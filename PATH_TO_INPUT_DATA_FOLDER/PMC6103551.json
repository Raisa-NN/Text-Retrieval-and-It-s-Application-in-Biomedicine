Over the last few weeks, he has been getting a burning sensation and pressure in his chest. The pain is exacerbated when he walks quickly or goes up the stairs, but improves with rest. Pain is located in the left chest and travels to bilateral shoulders. The pain is not worse with deep inspiration or change in position, but it is associated with nausea and diaphoresis. He is unsure if it feels similar to his gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He went to work this morning, but his pain did not improve while sitting at his desk and so he presents for evaluation.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16467540': 1, '24712683': 1, '22968795': 1, '20417055': 1, '23687548': 1, '14985204': 1, '28151877': 1, '24405350': 1, '21240777': 1, '10478693': 1, '25155021': 1, '6690891': 1, '8542492': 1, '19642147': 1, '28116003': 1, '30519138': 1, '20339952': 1, '30154677': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
