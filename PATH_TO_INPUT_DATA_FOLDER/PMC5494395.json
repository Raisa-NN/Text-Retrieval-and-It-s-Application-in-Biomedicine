She had a right pleural effusion on chest X-ray, and CT showed a well-demarcated huge mass, which pressed on the right lower lobe significantly (Fig. ). Her serum insulin and growth hormone levels were low (0.1 \u03bcU/mL and 0.11 ng/mL, respectively). We excised the right lower lobe with as much of the tumor as possible; the tumor had enlarged like the spokes of a wheel (Fig. ). There were spindle cells with high cellularity and prominent mitoses in the specimen microscopically (Fig. ). The cognitive disorder disappeared postoperatively. The patient has had no recurrence and remains in good condition 4 years after the operation.", "age": "[[81.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22768352': 1, '25113505': 2, '34221165': 1, '34423005': 1, '24934576': 2, '21958732': 2, '32793734': 1, '17866430': 1, '16702745': 1, '28680608': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5494395-1': 2, '4067084-1': 1, '4267432-1': 1, '3193814-1': 1}"}
