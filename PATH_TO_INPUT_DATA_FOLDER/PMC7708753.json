He had undergone left Vim thalamotomy 4 years ago for his right-side tremor. His head MRI and CT scan were performed before the stereotactic surgery. His UPDRS score before the surgery was ON 13 and OFF 42 with oral medications (L-dopa, trihexyphenidyl, pramipexole and ropinirole). He consented to undergo right Vim thalamotomy with VLT using the Cosman G4 radiofrequency system (electrode active tip 4 mm, diameter 1.1 mm, 70 \u00b0C for 30 s) (). His evaluation after the surgery revealed that the tremor in the left hand had improved.
