The nodular lesion was well-circumscribed, firm with surface ulceration. The patient attended Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) clinic with a clinical suspicion of malignancy. On physical examination, the lesion was not fixed to the underlying bone and no inguinal lymphadenopathy was detected.\\nFine-needle aspiration was performed using a 22-gauge needle. Cytological smears were cellular, showing clusters of basaloid cells having round to oval nuclei, nucleated squamous cells, and anucleated squames. Few fragments of shadow cells adherent to basaloid cells were also noted [Figure and ]. A cytological diagnosis of pilomatrixoma was made.\\nExcision biopsy and histopathologic examination of the resected specimen showed typical features of pilomatrixoma with basaloid cells in the periphery, shadow cells toward the center, and a few foreign body-type giant cells [Figure and ].", "age": "[[35.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'13700704': 1, '17718128': 1, '21769234': 2, '12203865': 1, '10355837': 1, '20514848': 1, '14184485': 1, '17011283': 1, '19554149': 1, '21552399': 1, '21131775': 1, '32908727': 1, '11507698': 1, '23766616': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3129122-1': 1}"}
