A Case Report", "patient": "A 48-year-old male patient with a history of alcohol abuse started to show progressive difficulties walking and a tremor of both hands starting 6 years earlier. Additionally, the patient presented with dysarthria and peripheral neuropathy. Repeated neurological examinations showed a wide-based gait, dysmetria in both upper and lower extremities, intention tremor, and dysdiadochokinesia. The increasing gait difficulties ultimately led to the use of a walking aid. Brain imaging (MRI) showed a mild degree of frontoparietal atrophy as well as diffuse, cerebellar atrophy without signs of Wernicke's encephalopathy (Fig. , , ). His clinical presentation was repeatedly considered to be alcohol related. In 2010, genetic testing showed a premutation in the FMR1 gene (87 CGG triplets). The testing was carried out because two cousins of maternal origin were diagnosed with FXS. The patient is the only child of two healthy parents. The mother has three siblings, two sisters and one brother, who are all healthy. At age 46, the diagnosis of FXTAS was made and genetic counseling for the patient and his family initiated. The patient has a son who is healthy.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25620899': 1, '14747503': 1, '25606366': 1, '15065016': 1, '27414076': 1, '19574929': 1, '33442376': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
