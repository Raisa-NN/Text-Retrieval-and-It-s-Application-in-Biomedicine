Prior to anesthesia, an appropriate size reusable laryngeal mask airway (LMA) (2.5) was selected according to the instructions of the manufacturer (appropriate for usage until 30 times based on factory recommendation). Patient didn\u2019t have any previous history of medical disease or drug use. Anesthesia induction was performed with remifentanil 1 \u03bcg/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, lidocaine 1mg/kg and atracurium 0.2 mg/kg after premedication with midazolam 0.15 mg/kg. Ventilation was maintained with bag mask and after reaching sufficient depth of anesthesia completely deflated LMA was inserted with the standard method. Later the cuff was inflated with 10 ml air according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Ventilation was pursued with manual bag ventilation; however, effective ventilation and chest rise was not achieved. Consequently, LMA was removed after deflation of the cuff and ventilation was continued with bag/mask ventilation. Repeatedly the same LMA was introduced and cuff was inflated but effective ventilation was not observed and the saturation started to decrease necessitating emergent LMA removal without cuff deflation. After removal of LMA, a baby cuff [] was observed which was created after inflation of the cuff. Finally, patient's airway was secured with another LMA successfully. Operation was completed and patient was discharged without any complication.", "age": "[[6.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19691691': 1, '24353586': 1, '16492872': 1, '18647269': 1, '9822002': 1, '23098746': 1, '9768795': 1, '24571772': 1, '24471683': 1, '25191199': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
