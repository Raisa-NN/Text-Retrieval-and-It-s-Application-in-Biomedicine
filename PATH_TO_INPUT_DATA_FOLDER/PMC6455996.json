There was no vomiting, diarrhea, melena, changes in bowel habits, rashes, or toxic ingestions reported. Parents denied sick contacts and recent travel history.

Other routine test results, including blood glucose, renal function, liver enzymes, electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin were within normal reference ranges. Urinalysis, stool testing, and cardiogram were also unremarkable. US of abdomen showed unremarkable. Abdominal CT scan was performed on account of physical examination and laboratory data, indicating enlarged appendix in diameter without intraluminal stones (Fig. ).

The patient's symptoms gradually improved on the second day after she was given antibiotics. On the 7th day of hospitalization, the patient was discharged in an asymptomatic condition. She was followed up after discharge without any symptoms, and appendicitis has not recurred yet.
