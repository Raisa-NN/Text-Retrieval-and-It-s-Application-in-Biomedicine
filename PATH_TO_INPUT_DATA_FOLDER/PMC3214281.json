On exploratory laparotomy, a low sigmoid diverticular perforation was found and a Hartman\u2019s performed. Two months later, a reversal was planned. During this surgery, the same difficulty of passing the stapler transrectally was encountered, as in the above case. As in the previous case, there were considerable perirectal adhesions which required meticulous dissection. After multiple futile attempts, a reverse stapling technique was attempted based on the previous experience. The similar steps were repeated and the anastomotic integrity confirmed. Postoperatively, the patient is doing well and is on regular follow-up since two years.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'7331368': 1, '2806031': 1, '28684934': 1, '3940811': 1, '443911': 1, '6753346': 1, '7227138': 1, '2765828': 1, '11177781': 1, '7025670': 1, '31214375': 2, '453950': 1, '28179015': 1, '22091338': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6535867-1': 1}"}
