The patient was initially in normal sinus rhythm (Figure ). After diuretics were initiated, his renal function worsened over 72 hours with an elevation in blood urea nitrogen/creatinine (from baseline of 39/2.8 to 96/4.3 mg/dL) and potassium increased from 4.7 to 5.8 mEq/L. Other electrolytes (serum sodium (137-142 mEq/L), calcium (8-9 mg/dL) and magnesium (1.8-2.6 mg/dL)) remained within normal limits. The patient developed severe sinus bradycardia, with competing junctional rhythm at 52 bpm. Also noted were bigeminal atrial premature complexes (APCs) conducted with an incomplete left bundle branch block (QRS interval 110 ms), at regularly coupled intervals of 600 ms, along with peaked T waves (Figure ). He was hemodynamically stable but admitted to the cardiac care unit where he was treated with hemodialysis resulting in restoration of normal sinus rhythm with resolution of APCs and normalization of T waves. However, the patient continued to have an episodic junctional rhythm (Figure ), but at a rate of 60 bpm, with atrial quadrigeminy coupled at 550 ms with normal T waves despite normal serum potassium (4.6 mEq/L) the next day and subsequently resolved over the next few days.", "age": "[[73.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'33100565': 1, '10037089': 1, '1110340': 1, '17243264': 1, '5338052': 1, '4691340': 1, '34712571': 1, '11207412': 1, '31998568': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
