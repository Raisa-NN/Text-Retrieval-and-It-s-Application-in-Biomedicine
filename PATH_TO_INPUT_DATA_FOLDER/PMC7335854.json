His last CD4 demonstrated 674 cells and a viral load of 417 copies. He presented erythematous-brown, infiltrated plaques on the face, trunk, and arms, as well as areas of multiple non-healing alopecia, with poorly defined borders, present in the occipital region of the scalp (). A biopsy of the cutaneous lesion was performed. The anatomopathological examination described an intact epidermis, a dermis with superficial and deep perivascular neural inflammatory lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, presence of foci of inflammatory aggression to nervous filaments, and formation of epithelioid granulomas, without Langhans giant cells. He had been diagnosed with syphilis, with Venenearal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL) = 1/512. The dermoscopy (, ) of the scalp lesions revealed empty hair follicles (3A), vellus hair (3B), follicular hyperkeratosis (3C), peripheral black dots (3D), dilated and tortuous vessels (3E), reddish-brown background (3F), and depigmented capillaries (3G). He was treated with benzathine penicillin, evolving with prompt regrowth in the areas of alopecia.", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29085722': 1, '16326843': 1, '29177154': 1, '22749730': 1, '26139324': 1, '25324910': 1, '32482551': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
