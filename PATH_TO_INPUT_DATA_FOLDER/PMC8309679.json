Endoscopic ultrasound revealed a mass of \u223c23.8 \u00d7 24.7 mm arising from the muscularis propria (). Computed tomography (CT) showed that the mass was 4.2 \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 5.2 cm located in the lower esophagus; no enlarged lymph nodes were discovered ().\\nSTER was conducted for the mass as previously described []. During the operation, we found that the main part of the mass was protruding into the mediastinum and near to the vagus (). Therefore, we resected it carefully in the mediastinum and the mass was completely resected (). The patient was discharged from hospital 5 days after STER, without complications including perforation and bleeding. The pathological result of the mass was leiomyoma. The follow-up showed no recurrence or adverse events during the routine gastroscopy and CT scan ().", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22056087': 1, '28059965': 1, '23765425': 1, '23955726': 1, '31368327': 1, '34316378': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
