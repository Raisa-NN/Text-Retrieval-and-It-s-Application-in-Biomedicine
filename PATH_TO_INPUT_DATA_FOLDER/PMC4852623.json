One month ago, he had slipped and been collided with head and back. On admission, he was alert without neurological deficit. He had no history of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medication. The serum coagulation tests were all within the normal range. Brain computed tomography scan revealed isodense subdural hematoma in right hemisphere without midline shifting (). There is no evidence of vertebral fractures. Spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed high signal intensity on T1-weighted image (WI) and low signal intensity on T2-WI in the L2-5 (). Because of no neurological deficit and no prominent mass effect, the patient was treated conservatively. Two weeks after admission, SSDH in the L2-5 was disappeared in follow-up lumbar MRI () and his symptoms were relieved.", "age": "[[62.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15292426': 1, '14985009': 1, '15070147': 1, '24527196': 2, '33912263': 2, '12486364': 1, '20828301': 1, '20700748': 1, '19190440': 1, '8114151': 1, '8837281': 1, '17353109': 1, '23006875': 1, '16528209': 1, '27857928': 2, '17473646': 1, '20505298': 1, '6879409': 1, '10358985': 1, '27169053': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8065266-1': 1, '8065266-2': 1, '8065266-3': 1, '3921281-1': 1, '5110909-1': 1}"}
