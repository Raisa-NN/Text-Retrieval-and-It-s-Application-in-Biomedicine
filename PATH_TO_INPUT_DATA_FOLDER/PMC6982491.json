The infant was born by cesarean section, and no complication associated with his birth was documented.\\nPhysical examinations indicated a long firm and painless hyperkeratotic projection on his left arm, which had approximately 1 cm in width and 2.5 cm in height with a black-colored top, brown-colored middle, and yellow-colored base.\\nThe lesion was excised and a punch biopsy was attained from its base. The hyperkeratotic part, and also the lesion base, was sent for accomplishing histopathologic examination. Although pathologic analysis indicated dense monomorphic foamy histiocytic infiltration, and also scattered eosinophils, there were no Touton giant cells (Figure ). Since the immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD68/factor XIIa and negative for S100/CD1a/langerin (CD207), the juvenile xanthogranuloma diagnosis was established for the patient.\\nNo abnormality was found in ophthalmologic examination.", "age": "[[6.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17958822': 1, '23235892': 1, '29624716': 1, '23461689': 1, '4621595': 1, '8493173': 1, '18489034': 1, '21679804': 1, '3115685': 1, '28329596': 1, '2515528': 1, '1536764': 1, '2039721': 1, '27904287': 1, '7094399': 1, '20083694': 1, '31998488': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
