He was found to have microscopic ipsilateral mediastinal adenopathy. He received adjuvant chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin followed by radiation therapy for his pathologic stage IIIA (pT2aN2M0) adenocarcinoma of the lung. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan in February 2013 did not show any evidence of malignancy.\\nOne year after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, in October 2013, the patient developed headaches. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was consistent with four intracranial metastases. PET/CT scan revealed several subcentimeter metastatic pulmonary nodules. EGFR/ALK/ROS1 testing at that time did not reveal any targetable mutations. He underwent whole brain radiation therapy.\\nIn the next two years, the patient had progression of disease (POD) in the lung through several lines of chemotherapy. He also developed CNS progression with three new lesions in December 2014, for which he underwent stereotactic radiation therapy (SRS). Six months later, the patient developed two more intracranial lesions for which he again received SRS. New intracranial subcentimeter metastatic disease was identified in September 2015 which was not amenable to further radiation. Immunotherapy with the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab was initiated in November 2015 ( and ).\\nEosinophil counts dating back to 1998 had always been within normal limits except for a brief period of mild increased eosinophilia after adjuvant chemotherapy in 2012 which spontaneously resolved. Four weeks after initiation of nivolumab, his absolute eosinophil count was noted to be elevated at 2.86 \u00d7 109/L; all other hematopoietic cell lines remained unaffected. He had denied any travel within the previous five years and denied any exposure to any known allergens, new products, or new medications. He was asymptomatic, and on physical examination, there was no evidence of skin rash or splenomegaly.\\nOn a follow-up visit in April 2016, after eight cycles of nivolumab, the peripheral blood smear revealed markedly increased eosinophils, but no other significant findings.\\nFurther work-up of the eosinophilia was performed and was unrevealing. Multiple stool samples were obtained, and testing for culture, ova, and parasites remained negative on three separate occasions as was testing for Clostridium difficile toxin. Serum IgG for Strongyloides and serum QuantiFERON test were negative. Liver function tests, thyroid function tests, cortisol, and B12 levels were also normal. Echocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and EKG did not reveal any abnormalities. Evaluation with bone marrow biopsy or molecular/cytogenetic testing was not pursued as it was felt that there was a clear temporal association of eosinophilia with nivolumab administration. MRI of the brain in February 2016 revealed continued mild progression of metastatic lesions and a new lesion in the left temporal lobe. The PET/CT at that time was consistent with systemic progression in the bone and lung. Given the degree of eosinophilia and evidence of progression, the decision was made to hold further nivolumab therapy in March of 2016.\\nAs the eosinophilia (3.5 \u00d7 109/L) was significant and persisted despite discontinuation of nivolumab, the patient was started on prednisone 10 mg daily in May 2016. Repeat MRI of the brain revealed an increase in the size of known intracranial metastases within the infratentorial and supratentorial regions. There was also a new area of edema and gyral-based enhancement with associated mass effect within the superior posterior left temporal lobe; this pattern of enhancement was considered atypical for metastatic disease. The differential included radiation related necrosis, encephalitis/cerebritis, or postinflammatory process.\\nGiven the concern for possible immune-mediated encephalitis/cerebritis, the patient was started on dexamethasone 4 mg twice a day at that time which was later increased to 4 mg three times a day, with a resolution of eosinophilia in two weeks. Two weeks later, in June 2016, the patient started developing thrombocytopenia. Evaluation of the peripheral smear confirmed thrombocytopenia with myelocytes, metamyelocytes, few nucleated red cells, and teardrop cells which was felt to be consistent with a possible myelophthisic process from marrow infiltration of the tumor. A repeat MRI of the brain two weeks later revealed a decrease in edema, the mixed response of lesions with some increasing and some decreasing in size, and the greater confluence of the left temporal lobe lesion which however remained stable in size.\\nThe next day, the patient presented to the emergency room with worsening shortness of breath. The computerized tomography angiogram of the chest was consistent with marked progression of the disease. Despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive treatment in the intensive care unit, the patient expired one week after his admission with the progression of the disease.
