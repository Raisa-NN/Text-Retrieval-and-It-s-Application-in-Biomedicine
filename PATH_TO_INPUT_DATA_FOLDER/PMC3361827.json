Grid laser treatment was performed in both eyes seven months ago. In spite of seven months of follow-up after grid laser with good systemic control, persistent CSME was found in both the eyes with central macular thickness (CMT) of 311 \u03bcm and 452 \u03bcm in the right and left eye respectively [Figs. and ]. Intravitreal bevacizumab was given in the left eye and the right eye was kept under observation. Four weeks after bevacizumab injection, CMT was reduced to 355 \u03bcm in the left eye with persistent CSME observed with maximum macular thickness (MMT) of 461 \u03bcm []. CMT increased in the right eye to 350 \u03bcm []. Intravitreal dexamethasone implant was injected in the right eye whereas second bevacizumab injection was given in the left eye. At six weeks of follow-up, CMT returned to 261 \u03bcm in the right eye [] whereas CMT and MMT were 306 \u03bcm and 420 \u03bcm respectively in the left eye [].\\nHigh intraocular pressure was recorded in the right eye (26 mmHg) and patient was kept on antiglaucoma medications. Patient also reported snake-like floater in the right eye. There was no other significant adverse effect noted during this short follow-up.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19410949': 1, '20417567': 1, '23901252': 1, '27147895': 1, '20980427': 1, '29784048': 1, '24492507': 1, '20507016': 1, '21188153': 1, '18662829': 1, '17398322': 1, '20855114': 1, '30634940': 1, '22569393': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
