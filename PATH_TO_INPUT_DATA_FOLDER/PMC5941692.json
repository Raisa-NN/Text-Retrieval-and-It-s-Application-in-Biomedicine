He had undergone Doppler study of the scrotum elsewhere, which revealed grade one varicocele with no evidence of Epididymo-orchitis. There was no other significant pathology in the Doppler. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics, parenteral and oral analgesics and scrotal elevation for around ten days. He had no relief and continued to have excruciating, severe pain. Pain was constant, continuous, with radiation from the scrotum to the inguinal region. Pain was not alleviated even with analgesics. There were no further aggravating factors. Clinical examination revealed normal looking scrotum with no features of inflammation. In view of pain out of proportion to clinical features, exploratory surgery was planned. Exploration revealed normal testis with blue prominent, tense and turgid varicoceles (red arrows in Fig. ). Patient underwent left Varicocelectomy. Postoperatively patient had immediate pain relief. Histopathology showed prominent varicocele with lumen completely occluded by thrombi adherent to the wall with no retraction space (Fig. ). A varicocelectomy specimen (done for primary infertility) was used for comparison and showed veins with in- vitro clots. The clot was not attached to the wall and there was clear retraction space between the clot and wall (Fig. ).", "age": "[[68.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11296657': 1, '28378166': 1, '4020995': 1, '33591903': 1, '24173817': 1, '19393542': 1, '27695590': 1, '20810018': 1, '32547738': 1, '2359164': 1, '29739377': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
