In the previous 2 months, she had experienced nausea without vomiting and weight loss (not measured).\\nComputerized tomography was performed for staging which revealed a large mass of 20.8 \u00d7 16.5 \u00d7 10.6 cm (1,902.6 cm3) in size with multiple areas of central necrosis and significant neovascularization in the left adrenal topography without a cleavage plane with pancreas and left kidney and thrombus in the inferior vena cava (fig. , fig. ). No other lesions were visualized. The patient was submitted to surgery with en bloc resection of the mass, body and tail pancreatectomy, splenectomy, left nephrectomy and thrombectomy of the inferior vena cava (fig. , fig. ). She was discharged from hospital on the fourth postoperative day with no complications.\\nHistopathology revealed an adrenal carcinoma, a solid pattern, associated with low grade, 20 \u00d7 18 cm in size, and Ki67 of approximately 5%.
