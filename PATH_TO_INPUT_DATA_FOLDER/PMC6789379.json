About one year ago, she received Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy.\\nThere was no significant past personal history or family history. Her physical examination was unremarkable.\\nHer laboratory tests only revealed an elevated blood platelet count of 370 \u00d7 109/L (normal reference range: 100-300 \u00d7 109/L). Blood coagulation, liver function, renal function, electrolyte, tumor marker, cholesterol, blood sugar, anti-autoantibody, urine, and conventional stool test results were all within normal limits.\\nA computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen showed no abnormality.\\nEndoscopic findings of all lesions are shown in Figure . The gastric mucosa showed grade C-2 atrophic gastritis according to the Kimura-Takemoto classification[] (Figure and ). A small, type 0-IIa (superficial elevated) submucosal tumor-like lesion, approximately 6 mm in diameter and with a whitish mucosal surface, was found on the anterior wall of the gastric corpus. The mucosa surrounding the lesion did not show atrophy. Narrow-band imaging showed an irregular microvascular pattern and dilatation of microvessels with branching architecture (Figure and ). The second lesion was on the gastric fundus and was approximately 4 mm in diameter. White light endoscopy revealed a flat, 0-IIb (superficial flat) lesion with a whitish mucosal surface. The mucosa surrounding the lesion did not show atrophy. Narrow-band imaging showed regular and dilated microvessels (Figure and ).", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20410811': 1, '23110017': 1, '30666417': 1, '33097069': 1, '27129734': 1, '26185396': 1, '23782334': 1, '24011952': 1, '23208952': 1, '25820416': 1, '17610477': 1, '29225256': 1, '34925726': 1, '22472957': 1, '26962407': 1, '24338239': 1, '31616705': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
