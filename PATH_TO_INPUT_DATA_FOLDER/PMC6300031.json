Brain DWI revealed multiple fresh infarcts in the right thalamus, occipital lobe, and bilateral frontal and parietal lobes (Fig. ). Brain MRA revealed stenosis of the right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) (Fig. ). The carotid CTA, TEE, and ambulatory electrocardiography findings were normal. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed no malignancies. Pelvic MRI showed an inhomogenenous mass in the uterus (Fig. ), suggesting of adenomyosis. This was comfirmed by histopathological study when hysterectomy was performed five months later. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated D-dimer (12,040 \u03bcg/L; normal range, < 500 \u03bcg/L), CA125 (546.5 U/mL; normal range, < 35 U/mL) and CA19\u20139 levels (1076.6 U/mL; normal range, < 37 U/mL). The hemoglobin level was 121 g/L. The levels of D-dimer, CA19\u20139, and CA125 re-evaluated 1 week later were 2200 \u03bcg/L, 213.7 U/mL, and 193.9 U/mL, respectively. After hysterectomy, the levels of D-dimer, CA19\u20139, and CA125 returned to within normal ranges, and no infarction recurred.", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27520610': 1, '22142777': 1, '30286732': 2, '12439560': 1, '32450843': 2, '20965437': 1, '1492807': 1, '29102541': 1, '33430804': 2, '27329260': 1, '15955949': 1, '29108806': 1, '27543913': 1, '16515887': 1, '30567506': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6300031-1': 2, '6300031-2': 2, '7798234-1': 1, '6171147-1': 1, '6171147-2': 1, '7249642-1': 1}"}
