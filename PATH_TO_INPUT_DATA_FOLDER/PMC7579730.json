Five years earlier, he began treatment with entecavir. In the past 9 mo, he experienced unexplained weight loss (approximately 10 kg).\\nHis physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities, except for liver palmar and spider nevus.\\nPlasma tumor marker levels, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and liver function appeared normal.\\nAbdominal ultrasound revealed a solid tumor, which was considered to be an HCC (38 mm \u00d7 35 mm), occupying the segments 4/8 of the liver. Abdominal dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion in the segments 4/5/8 (45 mm \u00d7 41 mm) of the liver, with multiple satellite nodules. The lesions invaded the middle hepatic vein (Figure ). MRI also revealed liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. No extrahepatic metastasis was observed on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT).\\nThe patient had a history of smoking for over 20 years.\\nFollowing a preoperative examination, the patient underwent resection of the liver segments 4/5/8. Postoperative pathological results revealed an SHC with satellite nodules, neurologic invasion, and no definite intravascular thrombus formation (Figure ). Immunohistochemical (IHC) results revealed the following: Cytokeratin (CK, +), Vimentin (+), Hepatocyte antigen (-), Arginase-1 (-), Cytokeratin 7 (+), Cytokeratin19 (CK19, partial +), Cytokeratin18 (CK18, +), Cytokeratin 8 (CK8, +), Glypican-3 (-), CD34 (vascular +), hepatitis B surface antigen (-), polyclone carcinoembryonic antigen (-), glutamine synthetase (partially +), and Ki-67 (30%).
