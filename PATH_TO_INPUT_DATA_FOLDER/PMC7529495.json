In 2018, he presented a painless polypoid lesion in the left popliteal fossa region with rapid growth, reaching 1.5 cm in diameter (Figure ). An excisional biopsy was performed and histopathological analysis reported a vascular proliferation with immunohistochemistry positive for cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), negative for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), 20% Ki67 and focal areas of stroma of necrotic aspect, suggesting a diagnosis of AVP versus angiosarcoma (Figure ). Due to the diagnostic uncertainty, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the c-myc gene was performed with negative results, confirming the diagnosis of AVP and reasonably ruling out the possibility of secondary angiosarcoma. At the clinical follow-up in 2020, after two years of resection of the vascular lesion, the patient remains free of relapses.", "age": "[[21.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20949568': 1, '24113311': 1, '21909081': 1, '16359542': 1, '30056201': 1, '23221487': 1, '24310944': 1, '16006792': 1, '15229481': 1, '26158365': 1, '20004841': 1, '24384851': 1, '7801888': 1, '21532879': 1, '17357996': 1, '19886715': 1, '24744928': 1, '31669437': 1, '20138394': 1, '18551753': 1, '33029459': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
