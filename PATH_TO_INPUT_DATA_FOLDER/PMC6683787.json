The physical examination showed three hypertrophied lobules covering the tip of the nose with deep pores and fine telangiectasia (Figures and ). The patient had been complaining of rosacea for years without receiving treatment.\\nSurgical excision was performed under local anesthesia using 2% lidocaine, which was injected into the nose. After the local anesthetic was infiltrated, the hypertrophied tissue was debulked using a number 10 scalpel. The excess tissue was removed layer by layer, with attention to preserve part of the basal appendages overlying the perichondrium to avoid the possibility of scarring. Hemostasis was achieved using bipolar electrocautery to reduce bleeding from the denuded area at a setting of 10-12 watts. Topical mupirocin ointment was applied to the wound, and the area was secured with a tie-over dressing.\\nThe dressing was removed after 72 hours, and the wound was left exposed to heal by secondary intention. The excised tissue was sent for histopathological study, and the diagnosis of rhinophyma was confirmed. Follow-up was continued with weekly visits until healing was completed by the fourth week ().", "age": "[[65.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34707790': 1, '20525327': 1, '18580161': 1, '24778841': 1, '12172152': 1, '29140869': 1, '15337973': 1, '32698277': 2, '25987948': 1, '18212550': 1, '11816064': 1, '31428506': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7317162-1': 1}"}
