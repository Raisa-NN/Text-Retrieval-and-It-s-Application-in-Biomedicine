Sensing and pacing parameters were adequate at implantation (R-wave 15 mV, impedance 670 \u03a9, and threshold 0.38 V at 0.24 ms). An increase in the pacing threshold was detected at 3 months of follow-up (R-wave of 12 mV, impedance of 560 \u03a9, and threshold 2.5 V at 0.24 ms) with an expected battery longevity of 38 months. Follow-up was performed by RM (Medtronic MyCareLink\u00ae Model 249562). The device reached the elective replacement time (ERI) in July 2019. A new LPM (LPM2) was implanted at a higher septal position with appropriate pacing parameters (R-wave 20 mV, impedance 1010 \u03a9, and pacing threshold of 0.5 V at 0.24 ms) (Figure , Panel A). The LPM1 was abandoned and programed in \u201cOFF\u201d (mode OOO). Unexpectedly, in the first programed RM follow-up, no data from the LPM2 were received. Therefore, the patient was scheduled for in-hospital face-to-face evaluation. Positioning of the transmitter head of patient in-home monitor over the left pectoral region (\u201cregular position\u201d) get communication only with the abandoned LPM1 but no data was transmitted. To obtain communication with LPM2, the transmitter head was moved across the patient\u2019s chest and back until satisfactory data transmission was achieved in the left scapular region (Figure , Panel B).", "age": "[[90.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'33664915': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
