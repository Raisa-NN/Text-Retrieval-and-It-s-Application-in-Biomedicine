Weight loss of over 10 kg in 2 months was also reported. On physical examination she was afebrile, and abdominal examination revealed a distended and tender abdomen with a right lower quadrant mass.\\nSubsequently she underwent radiological investigation of her chest and abdomen. CT abdomen revealed distension of the stomach as well as grossly distended loops of the small bowel. There was a lead point noted in the right iliac fossa with an ileoileal intussusception (). CT of her chest showed a large heterogeneous soft tissue density in the left upper lobe with associated left hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy.\\nAn emergency laparotomy was performed that confirmed an ileal intussusception, which was irreducible (). There were numerous small-to-moderate-sized pigmented deposits throughout the bowel and mesentery. A total of 40 cm of the jejunum and the corresponding mesentery with lymph nodes was removed. Histopathology confirmed metastatic melanoma with 6/6 mesenteric lymph nodes positive for metastatic disease. A staging CT brain showed two enhancing lesions in the right frontal and frontoparietal regions consistent with metastatic disease given her history. She was discharged home 10 days after laparotomy with plans for palliative treatment. The patient, however, died 2 months later.", "age": "[[47.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9632155': 1, '33552470': 1, '19410196': 1, '18590949': 1, '665907': 1, '12682534': 1, '17619936': 1, '10563199': 1, '32047590': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
