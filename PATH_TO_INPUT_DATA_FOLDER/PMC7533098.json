The brain MRI also showed deformation of the mesencephalon-midbrain due to severe brain sagging along with bilateral thick subdural hematomas. As a spinal CSF leak was suspected on the cervicothoracic MRI [], a myelo-CT was performed. When the myelo-CT demonstrated a microspur with dural leak ventrally at the T1/2 level; a targeted EBP was performed. Eighteen days later, when the orthostatic headaches and brain sagging recurred on the subsequent brain MRI, the patient underwent T1/T2 microspur removal with dural repair [- and ]. Six months postoperatively, the patient continued to do well.", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30055363': 1, '23144179': 1, '24949904': 1, '28192268': 1, '27552236': 1, '33024605': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7533098-1': 2}"}
