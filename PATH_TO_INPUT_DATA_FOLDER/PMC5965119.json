The patient\u2019s initial electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm with peaked T-waves ().\\nLaboratory data were significant for hyperkalemia of 8.8 and new-onset renal failure with a creatinine of 7.2. A repeat EKG was obtained and showed an incomplete right bundle branch with Brugada pattern of ST-segment elevation in leads V1 and V2 ().\\nThe automated EKG reading was an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; however, the lack of reciprocal changes made the ED team discount that. Cardiology was contacted for consultation and concurred, advising that the EKG change was likely secondary to hyperkalemia.", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'28326201': 1, '17188975': 1, '19322892': 1, '29849278': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
