He demonstrated minimal language development at the time of his acquired brain injury. As with participant 3, a diagnostic outcome of MCS was agreed across all four measures, however, items within behavioral domains show widely divergent outcomes across the different measures. MATADOC provided higher ratings than all other measures on two items: Visual responsiveness (Emerging) and Verbal commands (MCS). The CRS-R rated auditory responsiveness lower (VS) than the CNC and MATADOC (MCS). The PCC measure rated motor responses higher (MCS) than the other two measures that rated this domain. Agreement between authors for the MATADOC motor item was difficult to reach as the ratings were highly variable between and within raters, suggesting that the child\u2019s responsiveness bordered somewhere between VS and MCS levels. Inconsistent responses are a typical clinical presentation in DOC populations. We reached consensus on the more conservative rating of \u201cVS\u201d by giving greater weight to inter-rater and test\u2013retest agreement across all possible rating occasions for this item. The participant\u2019s responses can be seen to be highly variable across behavioral domains, spanning VS, MCS, and Emerging.\\nOverall inter-rater agreement was 73%. Unlike the other cases presented here, the observer\u2013rater rated much higher than the therapist\u2013rater in both live and video conditions: Live: observer\u2013rater 17% higher compared to therapist\u2013rater rating higher for just 5% occasions; Video: observer\u2013rater rated higher 18% than the therapist\u2013rater who rated higher for just 4% of opportunities. Test\u2013rest agreement was 80% overall. The principal subscale items performed particularly well for both inter-rater and test\u2013retest agreement: Visual responsiveness and arousal: 100%; Auditory responsiveness and Awareness of musical stimuli: 87.5% in both agreements. It is significant that these agreements were reached for behaviors that spanned across VS, MCS, and even Emerging. \u201cChoicemaking\u201d (Item 10) performed well on both inter-rater and test\u2013retest agreement (75% for each). Other items that performed well for test\u2013retest agreement were items rating \u201cEmotional response\u201d (Item 14) and \u201cChoicemaking\u201d (Item 10), both at 75% rating behaviors across VS and MCS. \u201cMusical response\u201d (Item 7) also had high agreement however mostly for absent responses, aside from ratings for \u201cTimbre\u201d which were for both mixed level responses.", "age": "[[5.9, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'14580666': 1, '18835749': 1, '33897341': 1, '31616268': 1, '16350962': 1, '8664760': 1, '25186739': 1, '24134739': 1, '19622138': 1, '24556655': 1, '11011813': 1, '19835239': 1, '1622317': 1, '19404190': 1, '23302033': 1, '24655034': 1, '21112421': 1, '24691354': 1, '32792456': 1, '11839831': 1, '24590150': 1, '23134422': 1, '7818633': 1, '8873704': 1, '4136544': 1, '33935868': 1, '24399950': 1, '11068163': 1, '21674197': 1, '16186042': 1, '15605342': 1, '21040571': 1, '24052091': 1, '16178024': 1, '12724701': 1, '10340973': 1, '24655307': 1, '16924995': 1, '22227888': 1, '15671590': 1, '26074850': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4443649-1': 2, '4443649-2': 2, '4443649-3': 2}"}
