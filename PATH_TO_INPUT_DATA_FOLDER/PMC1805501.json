Multiple biopsies reported to be a tentative diagnosis of multiple carcinoid tumors. He had never been diagnosed as having multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) or other multiple tumor syndromes. His family history was not contributory. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Serum serotonin level was within normal range, 221 ng/ml. Tumor markers were within normal limits, CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) 2.3 ng/ml, CA (carbohydrate antigen) 19-9 <2.0 U/ml. Computed tomographs of the brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis did not show any abnormality. He underwent abdominoperineal resection. Pathology revealed carcinoid tumors for about 30 submucosal nodules, which especially concentrated in the lower rectum (Figure , Figure ) and diffuse ganglioneuromotosis (Figure ). Both carcinoid tumors and ganglioneuroma located within the mucosal and submucosal layer. There was neither metastasis to the liver nor the lymph node. The patient had an uneventful recovery and is maintaining good health at 6 months after surgery at this writing.", "age": "[[69.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1643994': 1, '11330589': 1, '25342710': 2, '10717': 1, '16773283': 1, '25667620': 2, '31666465': 1, '25717261': 1, '29770149': 2, '34629921': 2, '9843346': 1, '25485211': 1, '2446733': 1, '23113855': 1, '15810633': 1, '30197486': 2, '17306015': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4650972-1': 1, '8493302-1': 1, '4316863-1': 1, '5889855-1': 1, '6127664-1': 1}"}
