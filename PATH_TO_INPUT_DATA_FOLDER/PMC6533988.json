At first, Bernard-Soulier syndrome was suspected due to\\nmacrothrombocytopenia and tendency of bleeding. When he was 17 years old,\\nhearing loss and hypertension were detected along with mild renal failure,\\nmicrohematuria and nephrotic-range proteinuria. Renal biopsy could not be\\nperformed due to risk of bleeding (platelets count: 7000/\u00b5L). Cataracts were\\nexcluded by ophthalmological evaluation. Due to the clinical suspicion of\\nMYH9-RD, genotyping of the patient and of his parents was\\nperformed. A de novo missense mutation in exon 1 of the\\nMYH9 gene [c.287C > T; p.Ser(TCG)96(TTG)Leu] was\\ndetected (). Actually, neither his\\nparents nor his brother and sister had clinical manifestation of\\nMYH9-RD. Enalapril (20 mg/day) was initiated for renal\\nprotection. The patient did not adhere to treatment and was lost to follow-up.\\nTwo years later, he returned to the outpatient clinic complaining of foamy\\nurine, peripheral edema, and hypertension (160/120 mmHg).
