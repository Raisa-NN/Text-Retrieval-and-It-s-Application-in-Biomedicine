He reported a history of positive RF in his early years, although he had no specific physical or surgical illness. He did not report any regular medication or alcohol consumption. Left knee radiographs (lateral and anteroposterior views) showed reduction of the medial joint space and osteophyte formation at the medial and lateral joint lines. A start of posterior osteophyte formation was also observed, thus indicative of HL grade 3 IA. The patient\u2019s MRI scan revealed a left to mid-meniscus tear, which was confirmed by diagnostic arthroscopy. A partial meniscectomy was performed at the time of arthroscopy. In his recent follow-up visits, the patient has reported aggravated left knee joint pain and swelling along with phalangeal pain in both hands.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21520254': 1, '21279996': 1, '18050309': 1, '16325089': 1, '25363757': 1, '3841640': 1, '18203762': 1, '21788902': 1, '27977731': 1, '18975039': 1, '9848593': 1, '11426019': 1, '20602810': 1, '12905471': 1, '22225630': 1, '21508866': 1, '24886556': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4031898-1': 2}"}
