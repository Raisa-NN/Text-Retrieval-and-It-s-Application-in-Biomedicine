For the prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia, monthly inhalation of pentamidine (a dose of 300mg in a nebulizer) was used and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was not given. She also had been taking methylprednisolone (1.9 mg/kg, daily), cyclosporine (1.4 mg/kg, daily) and mycophenolate mofetil (7.1 mg/kg, daily) for the treatment of BMT-induced graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD).\\nOphthalmic examination revealed visual acuity of 20/60 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left. There were mild cellular reactions in the anterior chambers and vitreous humors of both eyes. Densely opaque, yellow-white curvilinear infiltrates of 2 disc area size were observed with a small satellite lesion at the posterior retina of her right fundus. A similar infiltrate was also identified temporal to the macula in her left eye (). No retinal hemorrhage was found. Blood test showed positive CMV antigenemia (12/200,000 WBC). Necrotizing retinitis in the posterior pole with CMV antigenemia in this immunocompromised patient prompted us to make diagnosis of CMV retinitis. However, despite 2 weeks treatment with intravenous ganciclovir (2.5 mg/kg daily, dose adjusted to her glomerular filtration rate), her retinal lesion worsened and new satellites appeared (). In addition her vision had decreased to 20/400 in the right eye, and 20/60 in the left.\\nA subsequent blood test revealed the negative conversion of CMV antigenemia, but showed positive for serum toxoplasmosis antibody (both IgM and IgG by ELISA). At this time, the patient's mental status changed for the worse and a brain imaging was performed. The finding of multifocal, ill-defined nodular enhancing lesions in cerebral, cerebellar hemispheres and basal ganglia was consistent with toxoplasmic involvement of CNS (). The cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal in cell counts, protein and glucose and the CSF culture for fungus and bacteria were all negative.\\nWith a presumed diagnosis of concomitant toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis and encephalitis, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 5 mg/kg PO BID and clindamycin 600 mg PO QID were started. One week later, the cellular reaction in her anterior chambers and vitreous cavities had disappeared, and the size and thickness of her retinal infiltrates were decreased markedly. Brain MRI showed improvement as well. The inflammatory retinal lesion became inactive following six weeks of therapy; however her right vision failed to improve because of macular involvement (). Visual acuity at the last follow-up was 20/400 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left eye. Brain MRI taken after 6 weeks of therapy showed little evidence of any lesions. At four months after discontinuation of treatment, there was no evidence of ocular or intracranial recurrence.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12180115': 1, '27883376': 1, '8127570': 1, '23568271': 1, '1252177': 1, '8460279': 1, '32095610': 1, '8129664': 1, '18784451': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
