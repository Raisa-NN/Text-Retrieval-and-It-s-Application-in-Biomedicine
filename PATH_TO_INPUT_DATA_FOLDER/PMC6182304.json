In the last year, he developed an involuntary protrusion of the tongue out of the mouth, especially during eating. Despite this lingual dystonia, he did not have any difficulty moving the food inside the oral cavity or retaining the bolus of food inside the oral cavity. However, he did have difficulty pushing the bolus of food down his throat. For the same reason, he switched to a semisolid diet and had lost 5 kg over 6 months. A video fluoroscopic barium swallow study similar to the other patient was performed. The study revealed a delay in only the initial part of swallowing ( in the online-only Data Supplement). The patient was started on THP and tetrabenazine (TBZ), after which there was a 50% improvement in swallowing, and he gained 3 kg over 2 months.\\nThe other 5 cases had similar presentations and courses of illness; the details of which are listed in .", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11413266': 1, '17156419': 2, '23893444': 1, '31556260': 1, '25874059': 1, '19938148': 1, '2392232': 1, '26238914': 1, '30304925': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6182304-1': 2, '1702536-1': 1, '1702536-2': 1, '1702536-3': 1, '1702536-4': 1, '1702536-5': 1}"}
