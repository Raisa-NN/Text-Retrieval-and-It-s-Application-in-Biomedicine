Physical examination revealed multiple firm erythematous\u2013violaceous papules clustered in an annular pattern and distributed along the abdomen and lower extremities (). A 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) was identified as a possible trigger, since it had been administered 12 days prior to the onset of the skin lesions. A skin biopsy of the abdominal lesion was performed. Histopathological examination revealed foci of chronic interstitial inflammation and collagen necrobiosis with an associated lymphohistiocytic infiltrate ().\\nThe patient was diagnosed with generalized GA following pneumococcal vaccination based on the clinical appearance of the lesions, histopathological findings, and temporal relationship between the vaccinations and skin lesions. Treatment using mometasone furoate cream was initiated; however, no improvement was apparent after one month. The lesions eventually resolved spontaneously within two months of their initial appearance.", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22346267': 2, '24438149': 1, '9729059': 1, '34495491': 1, '15324406': 1, '11737453': 1, '12428851': 1, '23373894': 1, '29373237': 1, '16164728': 1, '33267970': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3276786-1': 1}"}
