On clinical examination, there was no motor weakness or sensory deficit. The patient was afebrile. On laboratory examination, the patient had normal hemoglobin levels, normal liver function test results, and normal results on uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, and urine analyses. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 15 mm/hour (normal, 0-10 mm/hour) and C-reactive protein (CRP) increased to 3 mg/dL (normal, 0-0.3 mg/dL). A written informed consent was obtained from the patient.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed marrow edema within the dens, anterior arch of C1 and pathological contrast enhancement at periarticular soft tissue (Figure 1a-d). Computed tomography (CT) revealed periodontoid calcified deposits suggesting CPPD (Figure 1e). Magnetic resonance imaging also demonstrated bone marrow edema on C4-5 facet joint and perivertebral signal alteration adjacent to the facet joint (Figure 2). The patient was diagnosed as CPPD disease and started systemic antiinflammatory treatment (oral colchicine). At one-year follow-up, the neck pain gradually improved.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'29526151': 1, '15856241': 1, '22325558': 1, '8915074': 1, '31796457': 1, '30190520': 1, '12221374': 1, '22428450': 1, '30415946': 1, '20646716': 1, '8657894': 1, '15795202': 1, '14994403': 1, '22933691': 1, '32584744': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
