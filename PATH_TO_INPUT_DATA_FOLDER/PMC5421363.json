Physical exam was normal; whereas the brain imaging demonstrated a huge intraaxial mass in the parietooccipital lobe originating from lateral ventricle associated with calcification [Figure and ]. Preoperative lab tests, including coagulopathy tests, were normal.\\nThe patient underwent craniotomy in the semilateral position. The head was fixed on Mayfield head fixation, and after craniotomy, total resection of tumor was done without any intraoperative complication. Postoperation, the patient was extubated and transmitted to the recovery room and then to neuro ICU. In ICU, generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure occurred suddenly and progressed to status epileticus. Despite administration antiepileptic agents, as seizure continued, the patient was intubated again after taking anesthesia. The postoperative CT scan showed the hemorrhage in the surgical field and in the cerebellar sulci in favor of RCH [Figure and ]. The control CT scan showed a raised amount of hematoma in cerebellar sulci []. All lab tests, including PT, PTT, and INR, were normal. The conservative treatment did not respond for the patient. He deteriorated during the following days and later he expired. The histopathologic finding of the tumor was compatible with ependymoma.", "age": "[[21.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16484416': 1, '8938765': 1, '11838798': 1, '30305969': 2, '16028781': 1, '10929723': 1, '28540120': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5421363-1': 2, '6165595-1': 1}"}
