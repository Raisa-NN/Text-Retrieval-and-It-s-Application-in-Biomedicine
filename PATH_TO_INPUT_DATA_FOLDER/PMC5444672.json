He had never smoked and had been treated for refractory asthma and chronic sinusitis for several years. He had no known exposure to any occupational respiratory hazards except that he had worked in a nuclear power plant in Taiwan since 1977. Physical examination revealed crackles and inspiratory and expiratory wheezes in both lungs on auscultation. Chest radiography showed mildly increased interstitial markings. He was admitted due to his symptoms and progressively worse airway obstruction. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed bronchiectasis, centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud opacities bilaterally suggesting diffused panbronchiolitis (DPB) (). A transbronchial lung biopsy confirmed the pathology for DPB. This patient received macrolide therapy with clarithromycin 1000 mg daily. Over the next 18 months after the initiation of macrolide therapy, he experienced a dramatic improvement. A chest CT scan was performed 18 months later to confirm the clinical improvement ().", "age": "[[64.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19454804': 1, '24219326': 1, '28069906': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
