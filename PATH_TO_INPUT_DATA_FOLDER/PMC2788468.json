There was no history of any surgical interventions in the past. Physical examination revealed tenderness in right lumbar region, with mild guarding. The general examination was normal. Hernial orifices and the genitalia were also normal. Ultrasound examination revealed an echogenic mass in the right lumbar region, anterior to the colon, with the appearance of abnormal fatty tissue. The right iliac fossa appeared normal. Blood investigations showed a total leukocyte count of 4780/cmm with predominant neutrophilia, and the other laboratory tests were within normal limits. A CT scan revealed fat stranding anterior to the ascending colon in right lumbar region with normal findings in the region of the appendix []. Laparoscopy revealed gross inflammation of parietal peritoneum over anterior abdominal wall. A segment of greater omentum, measuring 12 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2 cm, was rotated around its longitudinal axis at the base. The omentum distal to the twisted segment was discolored, edematous, inflamed, and adherent to the anterior abdominal wall. Minimal free fluid in the pelvis was noted, but the appendix could not be visualized. A segmental omentectomy was done. The postoperative period was uneventful. The histopathology report was suggestive of acute omentitis with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.", "age": "[[11.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26550064': 1, '25121029': 1, '10819485': 1, '33959253': 2, '5505870': 1, '14618528': 1, '8652207': 1, '15529836': 1, '30008978': 1, '14654645': 1, '8491897': 1, '20011502': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8087459-1': 1}"}
