His past medical history was remarkable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, diabetic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, hyperlipidemia, anemia, low back pain, left inguinal hernia, pruritus of the skin, psoriasiform dermatitis, obstructive sleep apnea, anxiety, depression. His current medication included glyburide, ibuprofen, lisinopril, metformin, methimazole, and simvastatin.\\nCutaneous examination of the nails on his hands showed a midline ridge with a linear split of the right thumbnail extending from the distal lunula to the end of the nail plate (Figure ). His other fingernails and toenails were without dystrophy. A roentgenogram of his right thumb did not reveal any abnormalities of the soft tissue or bony structures.\\nA biopsy of the right thumbnail matrix was performed. Microscopic evaluation of the tissue specimen showed islands of basophilic calcium salts present in the sclerotic connective tissue of the dermis (Figure ). The periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for hyphae.\\nThe pathologic findings were interpreted as calcification within the dermis. Correlation of the clinical presentation and pathology established a diagnosis of subungual calcinosis cutis. His nail dystrophy was attributed to the effect of the calcium present in the nail matrix.", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22741938': 1, '21654339': 1, '2406419': 1, '24079579': 1, '14001803': 1, '14943266': 1, '21679810': 1, '17097384': 1, '28010889': 1, '6662727': 1, '23182670': 1, '34650869': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
