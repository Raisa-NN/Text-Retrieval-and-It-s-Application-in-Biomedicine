SARS-CoV-2 infection was suspected. Admission Blood tests showed severe hypoxemia in arterial blood gases, leukocytosis, and elevated acute phase reactants; the SARS-CoV-2 RT- PCR was positive. The admission chest X-ray (Figure ) and CT (Figure ) revealed generalized, bilateral, and patchy ground-glass opacities. The patient's clinical condition worsened and developed an acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) with respiratory failure type I and he was transferred to the ICU. The patient required the support of mechanical ventilation for the next ten weeks. A control chest CT was performed two months later, disclosing bilateral lung cystic lesions and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (Figure ). There were no bacterial superinfections. After three months in the ICU, the patient was transferred to the general wards and discharged a week after with oxygen by nasal cannula and oral steroids with progressive tapering until discontinuation. In his 3-month follow-up and to this day, the patient is in acceptable general conditions, the supplemental oxygen was weaned, and he has not presented pneumothorax or emergency visits.", "age": "[[56.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'33456035': 1, '32664179': 2, '32101510': 1, '33728014': 1, '32500509': 1, '32207255': 2, '34381949': 1, '32358406': 2, '34033648': 1, '32105637': 1, '32951046': 1, '32874972': 1, '34374591': 1, '17110851': 1, '27180915': 1, '33095680': 1, '34909313': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7440163-1': 1, '7440163-2': 1, '7360306-1': 1, '7183834-1': 1}"}
