Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a large mass lesion in the body and tail of pancreas with associated necrotic retroperitoneal lymph nodes, multiple liver metastases. Fine-needle aspiration cytology and biopsy from liver lesion confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma from pancreas. In view of metastatic disease, patient was started with FOLFIRINOX based palliative chemotherapy, but due to intolerance to chemotherapy he had to shift to gemcitabine and erlotinib based 2ndline chemotherapy. He received seven cycles of weekly chemotherapy and after that re-evaluation with CT scan whole abdomen showed significant partial regression in bulk of pancreatic mass and liver lesions. After cycles gemcitabine was stopped and he continued on maintenance therapy with erlotinib.\\nDuring an outpatient visit for follow-up, patient reported with abnormal growth of eyelashes in both eyes. Patient was advised for trimming of eyelashes as and when required.", "age": "[[39.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23801914': 1, '19954400': 1, '21655160': 1, '21483009': 1, '17237698': 1, '18612164': 1, '25114450': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
