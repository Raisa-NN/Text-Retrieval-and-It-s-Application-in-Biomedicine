The patient was receiving etanercept 50 mg per week, prednisolone, and methotrexate for the past five years and her arthritis was currently in remission. According to her history, she firstly noticed a small ulcer on her foot, approximately ten months ago. She consulted her physician, who considered it as a local infection and prescribed local antimicrobial and antifungal treatment, with no improvement.\\nDuring the next months the ulcer slowly progressed and she was referred to our hospital, where she underwent mycologic and bacteriologic examination. Gram stains and cultures obtained from the ulcer were negative. A 3 mm punch biopsy of the lesion was performed and histological examination revealed the presence of a SCC. The lesion was surgically excised on healthy boundaries with removal of the fifth toe ().
