Subsequently, he noticed an itchy skin eruption and visited our dermatology department on 1st September, 2010. The patient had a childhood history of varicella. Physical examination revealed sparsely distributed vesicles, some with umbilication, and small erythematous erosions on the face, anterior chest, upper back, and upper extremities [Figure , ]. A tense bulla was also present on the left thigh. A total of seven lesions were observed. Histological analysis of a vesicle showed an intraepidermal blister containing degenerated balloon cells [Figure , ]. Within a few days, there was widespread eruption of vesicles and bullae over the body [Figure , ] and the fever became continuous. Zosteriform lesions were not observed.\\nHe was admitted for intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg/day) for 5 days, with a reduced dose as the patient had renal dysfunction of an unknown cause. The skin lesions responded promptly to therapy: no new skin lesions developed and the bullous lesions began to scab, though some lesions remained active. In addition, the fever decreased. The patient was discharged after 5 days of intravenous acyclovir, with oral valacyclovir (20 mg/kg/day) advised for a further 9 days. By September 21, most of the skin lesions had scabbed.\\nWe measured the serum levels of anti-VZV IgG and anti-VZV IgM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Enzygnost Anti-VZV/IgG and Enzygnost Anti-VZV/IgM, Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL, USA) on days 3 and 33 after the appearance of the skin eruption. The values of anti-VZV IgG were expressed in international units (i.e., mIU/ml, with values <57.0 mIU/ml being considered negative); the measurement of anti-VZV IgM were expressed as a cut-off index (i.e., <1.0: negative, 1.0\u20132.0: indeterminate, and >2.0: positive). Serum anti-VZV IgG was negative on day 3 and 260 mIU/ml on day 33. Serum anti-VZV IgM was negative on both days 3 and 33. Based on the clinical and serological findings we diagnosed VZV reinfection.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'6321605': 1, '11407342': 1, '17162216': 1, '18640569': 1, '6302208': 1, '18979611': 1, '12930392': 1, '23112365': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
