Case series", "patient": "A 7 year-old female was referred to our Ophthalmologic Unit because of a two year history of ocular burning and lacrimation with photophobia, usually worse from March to October. Clinical signs of VKC were found (giant limbar papillar conjunctivitis and Horner-Trantas dots). Slit lamp exam also detected keratic precipitates and a positive Tyndall sign (cell grading: 2), consistant with bilateral uveitis. No infections and/or systemic associated diseases were detected and the diagnosis of idiopathic uveitis was made. VKC was successfully controlled with topical 1% cyclosporin A (1 drop per eye twice a day), but frequent uveitis relapses required several topical steroid courses (dexamethasone: 2 drops per eye three times a day) and cyclopegic drugs (1 drop per eye once a day). For this reason and on the basis of the previous two cases, 0.1% topical treatment with FK-506 eyedrops was started (1 drop per eye three time a day), with a prompt recovery of both the diseases within 10 days. Topical tacrolimus was maintained at full dosage for three months before tapering and then discontinued after six months. VKC and uveitis were still in remission off therapy after a follow-up of one year. No sign or symptom compatible with a rheumatic disease later appeared.", "age": "[[7.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12063032': 1, '10321319': 1, '17294385': 1, '17467532': 1, '12774069': 1, '18484686': 1, '10525040': 1, '16704708': 1, '10857837': 1, '18476802': 1, '18676502': 1, '18221998': 1, '33498753': 1, '3994956': 1, '8373003': 1, '12269651': 1, '318121': 1, '28286787': 1, '15829797': 1, '16987901': 1, '22047067': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3221618-1': 2, '3221618-2': 2}"}
