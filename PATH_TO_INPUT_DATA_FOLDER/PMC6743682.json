On examination, he had a left-sided partial foot drop (extensor hallucis longus dorsiflexion 3/5) and sacral hypoesthesia. The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed severe L4\u2013L5 stenosis, and two lumbar cysts: cyst I was located in the left foramen, while Cyst II was situated between the dura and ligamentum flavum; there was no evidence of instability [Figures and ]. A transforaminal endoscopic approach revealed that cyst I was attached to the left facet joint; indeed, it proved to be a synovial cyst []. A full endoscopic interlaminar approach was utilized to excise cyst II; this huge epidural cyst with marked adhesions was not connected to either the ligamentum flavum or the dura []. []. Postoperatively, the patient had immediate pain relief and remained asymptomatic 6 months later [].\\nCyst I originated from the facet joint and had a synovial lining consistent with a synovial cyst. The \u201cSpontaneous Degenerative Epidural Cyst II,\u201d located in the epidural space between the dura and the ligamentum flavum, showed granulation tissue with microcalcifications, woven bone formation, hemosiderin pigmentation, and focal cystic changes [].", "age": "[[74.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21808679': 1, '4826604': 1, '18275873': 1, '32724694': 2, '23859245': 1, '31528396': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7382722-1': 1}"}
