Patient was unable to stand from sitting posture and was unable to walk without support. During normal conversation his speech was not understandable. Patient also suffered from insomnia, urinary dysfunction, sexual dysfunction and constipation. Blurred vision and heaviness in eye were also present. The disease was progressive in nature that first affected lower limbs and then his upper limbs. Patient suffered from the disease since last 16 years. Patient had consulted neurology department of AIIMS New Delhi and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital New Delhi 14 years before coming to us. The diagnosis using genetic mapping indicated SCA-2, i.e. Autosomal Dominant Cerebellar Ataxias (ADCA-1). Patient had strong family history with anticipation. Due to unavailability of satisfactory treatment and failing to get any response from allopathic treatment, the patient decided to take Ayurvedic treatment. Patient was diagnosed for V\u0101ta vy\u0101dhi (group of various neurological disorders) and was admitted in male Pancakarma ward of National Institute of Ayurveda, Jaipur India for administration of Pancakarma procedures.\\nOn physical examination patient was found to be anxious with reduced sleep, had moderate appetite, visam\u0101gni (unstable digestive functions), bowel constipated, burning micturition with reduced frequency, tongue clean, voice clear, skin rough and lean body built. His intelligence was normal and had a v\u0101tapitta prakrti with madhyama s\u0101ra (medium purity of body tissue), madhyama samhanana (medium body built), sama pram\u0101na (equal body proportions), avara s\u0101tmya (least homologation), madhayam sattva (medium mental strength), avara vy\u0101y\u0101m\u015bakti (least physical endurance), madhyama \u0101h\u0101ra\u015bakti and jaraan\u015bakti (medium food intake and digestive power). Majj\u0101v\u0101ha srotodusti (pathology in bone marrow) was more prominent. On eye examination, ocular apraxia was found, saccades and pursuits were affected. On motor examination, facial, truncal and upper limbs fasciculation was found. The bulk, tone and power of muscles were normal. Stretch reflexes were normal and plantar flexor, sensory examination was normal. Cerebellar signs (such as intention tremor, past pointing in the finger nose test, dysdiadochokinesis and truncal ataxia) were positive. Skin, cardio respiratory, musculoskeletal and genitourinary system examinations were normal.\\nA detail of the case study and follow up is given in .\\nPatient was a known case of SCA 2. It was previously confirmed by genetically mapping. In an M.R.I. scan of brain, cerebellar atrophy was revealed. Previous hematological investigation and electrophysiology were normal. Patient suffered from gadgadatva (impaired speech) kampa (tremor), k\u0101layakha\u00f1jat\u0101 (Limping with tremor at the starting of movement), anidr\u0101 (insomnia), m\u016btranigraha (urinary dysfunction), pur\u012bsa-apravrtti (constipation), paribhram (vertigo and imbalance), sphurana (fasciculation) etc. These diseases are counted in n\u0101n\u0101tamaj v\u0101ta vy\u0101dhis (disease only due to v\u0101ta dosa).[] Hence this disease is a group of n\u0101n\u0101tmaja v\u0101ta vy\u0101dhis and v\u0101ta vy\u0101dhi was concluded to be the Ayurvedic diagnosis.

This reduced to 15 after treatment. After 2 months of treatment, the patient was able to stand from the sitting position. He was able to walk without support []. He was able to turn during walking []. His speech was improved and it was easily understandable []. Autonomic dysfunctions improved. Heaviness in the eye, insomnia and constipation was relieved.
