He described the sudden onset of pleuritic anterior chest pain radiating to his back and throat with associated transient left arm paraesthesia. He did not report any preceding symptoms. He reported ongoing pain despite administration of intravenous morphine and sublingual glyceryl trinitrate on arrival. He took no regular medications. He had never smoked, drank minimal amounts of alcohol and denied illicit substance use.\\nExamination revealed a thin male in visible discomfort. His heart rate was 60 bpm, blood pressure 170/100 mm Hg and 155/100 mm Hg on the left and right arm, respectively, with normal oxygen saturations and respiratory rate. There were no features of Marfan syndrome. Radial pulses were equal in volume bilaterally and there was no radial\u2013radial delay. Heart sounds were dual with no murmurs nor carotid bruits, and his lung fields were clear to auscultate. The neurological examination was unremarkable.\\nExamination of the abdomen was performed with the patient in the supine position with arms resting at his sides to relax the rectus muscles. On light manual palpation, his abdominal aorta was easily appreciated, though it was not distensible to suggest aneurysmal dilation. On deeper palpation in the central abdomen over the abdominal aorta, the patient described immediate and reliable reproduction and exacerbation of his chest pain.", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21549622': 1, '20459208': 1, '9842019': 1, '10685714': 1, '8969580': 1, '29167214': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
