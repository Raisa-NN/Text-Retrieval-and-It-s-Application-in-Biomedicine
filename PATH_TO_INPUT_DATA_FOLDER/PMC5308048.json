Before biopsy, he underwent MP-MRI, which demonstrated two intraprostatic lesions suspicious for harboring prostate cancer suitable for targeted biopsy. Both lesions were classified as low-suspicion for harboring clinically significant prostate cancer. Following the diagnostic MP-MRI, the patient underwent targeted biopsies through MRI/US fusion-guidance using the UroNav software fusion platform (InVivo, Philips, Gainesville, FL, USA) in addition to standard 12-core extended sextant biopsy. On fusion biopsy, pathology showed low-volume Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 (Grade Group 1), acinar adenocarcinoma involving one core as well as PIN-like ductal adenocarcinoma involving a separate core. We questioned whether this patient could be considered a safe candidate for AS given the presence of PIN-like ductal adenocarcinoma.", "age": "[[66.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26742998': 1, '25044687': 1, '18496142': 1, '25626035': 1, '23727310': 1, '4091189': 1, '23821585': 1, '19996627': 1, '25897467': 1, '26674305': 1, '25754621': 1, '28216939': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
