The physical examination and laboratory studies were unremarkable.\\nErect posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the chest showed a well marginated anterior mediastinal mass in the entire right lung zone, compressing the lower trachea, right bronchus, and heart toward the left side (). CT scan of the chest demonstrated a 20\u00d716\u00d710 cm-sized, cystic mass with focal heterogeneously enhanced solid portion anteromedially in the anterior mediastinum. Direct invasion of the anterior chest wall and pericardium by the mass was suggested, because pericardial fat plane was obliterated and the margin between the mass and the adjacent right anterior chest wall and pericardium was indistinct (). Minimal amount of right pleural effusion and pericardial effusion were associated.\\nAt surgery, after aspiration of fluid within the cystic mass, pericardial invasion was noted. Thus, partial resection of the mass was done. Histologically, squamoid tumor cells formed cords or solid sheets within the fibrous stroma admixed with mucin-secreting epithelium lining gland-like spaces (). The final pathologic diagnosis was poorly differentiated mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the thymus. The patient died in one year after surgery despite postoperative radiation therapy.", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34158908': 1, '1991250': 1, '1631879': 1, '9266892': 1, '1950860': 1, '7113703': 1, '2006719': 1, '12376602': 1, '16482933': 1, '24533423': 1, '25364536': 1, '24444077': 2, '1734461': 1, '11159089': 1, '7793481': 1, '15308855': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3938068-1': 1}"}
