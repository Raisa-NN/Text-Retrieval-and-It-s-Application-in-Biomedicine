She was diagnosed with a Grade 2, lymph node-positive, ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive lobular carcinoma. Her CA-15.3 and bone profile were within normal limits.\\nThe patient\u2019s isotope bone scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease () but an X-ray of the pelvis showed sclerotic lesions mostly localized in the iliac wings (), and CT scan of the thorax and abdomen showed multiple small sclerotic nodules throughout the entire skeleton (). In the clinical context, the radiologist suggested that these lesions likely represented metastatic deposits, but that a benign cause such as osteopoikilosis should be considered.\\nThe Breast MDT opinion was that given the normal bone scan, CA-15.3, bone profile and absence of bone-related symptoms, a diagnosis of bone metastasis seemed unlikely. Therefore it was explained to the patient that the bony abnormalities detected on X-ray and CT were most likely to be due to osteopoikilosis. She was subsequently treated with adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy to the left chest and left supraclavicular fossa, alongside hormonal therapy. Three years later, there has been no evidence of disease recurrence. Further CT scans performed in 2013 and 2014 showed stable appearances in the bones.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9354811': 1, '18684881': 1, '3054417': 1, '15801069': 1, '16034900': 1, '22381091': 1, '24745681': 1, '24663043': 1, '23593539': 1, '22461100': 1, '1624505': 1, '11764303': 1, '30363150': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6159113-1': 2}"}
