He had a 4-day history of high fever and diffuse skin rash. According to his medical history, he was previously healthy except for the right tibia fracture sustained after a skiing accident 2 weeks before admission. The family history was unremarkable.\\nOn admission, seizure was treated and stopped with administration of one dose of midazolam and phenobarbital. Detailed physical examination revealed maculopapular rash on the face, trunk and extremities, nonpurulent conjunctivitis, cracked, fissured lips, and cervical lymphadenopathy. He had a fever of 39\u00b0C. Meningeal signs were negative. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable.\\nIn , the laboratory findings on admission and after the intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) therapy are shown. shows the results of immunological analysis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed WBC of 1/mm3, protein 225 mg/dl (up to 50), glucose 4.84 mmol/l (blood glucose 5.02 mmol/l), chloride 118.0 mmol/l, and 118\u2013132 lactate 2.5 mmol/l (1.1\u20132.8). Results of blood, CSF, and urine bacterial cultures were negative.\\nSerological tests for viruses IgG and IgM (adenovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, influenza A and B, parvovirus B19, anti-HCV, HBsAg, coxsackievirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex type 1 and 2) were negative except for positive IgG antibodies to cytomegalovirus and adenovirus. CSF viral screening for herpesvirus was negative. Urine analysis was normal. Computed tomographic scan of the brain was unremarkable. The results of a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram, and a transthoracic echocardiogram were normal as well as the levels of kinase isoenzyme (creatine kinase-muscle/brain), cardiac troponin I, and plasma N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. Neck ultrasound revealed cervical lymph nodes of 15 mm diameter bilaterally. An electroencephalogram showed cerebral dysfunction with delta frequency slowing in the parietal\u2013temporal\u2013occipital areas bilaterally.\\nThe patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Initially, he was treated with phenobarbital, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and osmotic therapy with mannitol to decrease suspected cerebral edema.\\nOn the 2nd day of hospitalization, the patient remained febrile, with further impairment of consciousness and GCS score of 6. Due to the development of respiratory failure, he was intubated with initiation of mechanical ventilation.\\nOn the same day, urgent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [] was performed. Axial diffusion-weighted image showed hyperintense areas scattered throughout the brain parenchyma, including the basal ganglia (A). These areas showed restricted diffusion on the apparent diffusion coefficient drop and slight hyperintensity on the axial T2-weighted (T2W) image, suggestive of cytotoxic edema (B, C). Three-dimensional time-of-flight (3D-TOF) MR angiography revealed discrete narrowings of middle cerebral artery but no aneurysms (D). Susceptibility-weighted imaging images did not reveal the presence of microhemorrhages and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage (not shown).\\nBased on all the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with KD complicated with cerebral vasculitis and encephalitis. Treatment with IVIG as a single infusion of 2 g/kg along with acetylsalicylic acid (50 mg/kg/day) was started. Within 24 h, the fever resolved with disappearance of skin rash and mild improvement in the level of consciousness.\\nOn the 3rd day of hospitalization, the patient was successfully extubated. Acyclovir treatment was discontinued after laboratory investigations for herpesvirus proved to be negative. On the following days, the boy was confused, occasionally extremely irritable and delirious with persistence of GCS score in the range of 8\u201310, and recurrence of fever. Brain MRI on the 6th day of hospitalization showed progression of initially noted changes [].\\nTherefore, on the 9th day of hospitalization, the patient was started on the intravenous steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for 5 days) followed by oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day). The response to steroid therapy was excellent with significant improvement in neurological status. Full motor function recovery was noted on the 15th day of hospitalization. Improvement of cognitive function was slower but continuous and complete by the time of hospital discharge. Periungual desquamation of the fingers was noted in the 3rd week of illness. Repeated echocardiogram was normal. The patient was discharged after 45 days of hospitalization.\\nThe patient did not have a functional neurological disorder symptom, and he had normal cognitive functions when he was discharged from the hospital. No antiepileptic drugs were used. The dosage of corticosteroids was gradually decreased and then stopped completely after the 3rd month. Follow-up brain MRI, 2 months after the onset of the disease, did not reveal areas with restricted water diffusion (A, B). T2W image showed parenchymal atrophy (C). 3D-TOF MR angiography confirmed normalization of the cerebral circulation [].", "age": "[[7.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'2223179': 1, '17028804': 1, '9660380': 1, '17156704': 1, '21691693': 1, '22964445': 1, '19167633': 1, '20616737': 1, '15505111': 1, '22100015': 1, '6638393': 1, '32713710': 1, '7395511': 1, '6062087': 1, '32189869': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
