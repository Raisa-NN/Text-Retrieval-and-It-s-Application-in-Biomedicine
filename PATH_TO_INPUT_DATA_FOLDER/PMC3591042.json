The swelling had gradually increased in size to reach a size of 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm at the time of examination. Local examination revealed an asymptomatic mass present at the left angle region of the mandible that was firm and non-fluctuant. The overlying skin was normal in color and texture. The swelling was more prominent with the teeth clenched and while contracting the masseter, and it extended from the posterior border of ramus toward the anterior border.\\nThere was no intraoral extension of the swelling.\\nUltrasonography report was suggestive of a lipoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study showed a well-defined, oval-shaped, hyperintense signal in T1- and T2-weighted images involving the masticator space, adjacent to the masseter muscle and the superficial lobe of the parotid gland of the left side [].\\nThe tumor was excised under general anesthesia via an extraoral submandibular incision. Wide excision of the entire lesion was performed. The excised specimen appeared pale yellow in color with a lobulated surface []. Histologic examination showed the mass to consist of mature adipocytes separated by fibrous septae, and a diagnosis of lipoma was made []. There has been no recurrence in 2 years following surgery, and we continue to monitor the patient regularly.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26981479': 2, '23139554': 1, '12653233': 1, '16359147': 1, '19721405': 1, '14144187': 1, '20566915': 1, '26752882': 2, '23483080': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4691992-1': 1, '4772569-1': 1}"}
