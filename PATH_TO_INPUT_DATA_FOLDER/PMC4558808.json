The patient presented with recurrent attacks of headache associated with a complete ophthalmoplegia on the right side. The patient could not tolerate carotid occlusion on the right side as well. The patient was operated using a high flow by-pass (external carotid artery to MCA using a radial artery graft). The internal carotid artery was then completely ligated for tumor resection. Postoperative computed tomography angiography revealed the flow on the side with the by-pass to be very good, in fact better than, the normal side because of a patent high flow by-pass graft.", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23208054': 1, '21691988': 1, '23378386': 1, '15658104': 1, '16148974': 1, '22607318': 1, '23230693': 1, '15271247': 1, '21107186': 1, '21623323': 1, '22102946': 1, '22935820': 1, '22456648': 1, '22921036': 1, '22278357': 1, '23084349': 1, '22846792': 1, '19953378': 1, '23407293': 1, '21298453': 1, '22668888': 1, '15157302': 1, '23228360': 1, '17297373': 1, '21600500': 1, '23454690': 1, '26425161': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4558808-1': 2}"}
