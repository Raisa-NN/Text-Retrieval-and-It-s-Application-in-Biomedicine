She reported a history of recent ambient, but not direct, exposure to nitrous oxide of certain quantity and an experience of flu-like symptoms 1 month prior to developing clinical symptoms. Her family history was significant for multiple sclerosis in her mother. Her two sisters, 26 and 29 years of age, were at their baseline health as described below (Figure ).\\nThe proband first complained of reduced finger dexterity and gait disturbance described as \u201cdifficulty balancing.\u201d During subsequent weeks, she developed severe paranoid delusions, blurred vision, and worsening gait. Over the next 3 months, the patient required admissions to two local hospitals for evaluation and management of acute psychosis and neurologic deterioration, including a voluntary admission to an inpatient psychiatric hospital. T2/FLAIR brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) was notable for diffuse periventricular white matter changes and basal ganglia involvement. T2/FLAIR spine MRIs showed extensive dorsal white matter involvement extending from C4 to C5. Diagnostic evaluations for common infections, cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands, myelin basic protein, and paraneoplastic autoantibodies were negative. Serum vitamin B12 levels were normal. She was treated with methylprednisolone for a presumed autoimmune disorder. During one hospitalization, she was diagnosed with a provoked deep venous thrombosis complicated by a pulmonary embolism. A thrombophilia evaluation was negative for abnormalities in protein C, protein S, factor V Leiden, antithrombin III, and prothrombin. She was treated with enoxaparin and apixaban.\\nThe proband was admitted to our institution, 4 months after her initial presentation, for further diagnostic evaluation and management of severe progressive psychiatric symptoms and neurological deterioration. On presentation in the emergency department, she was unable to ambulate independently, developed urinary retention, had worsening paranoid delusions, severe perseverative speech, frequent panic attacks, and transient catatonia with cerea flexibilitas. Her neurologic exam was significant for poor attention, perseverative and distractible conversation, and inability to name days of the week forward or backward. Her upper extremities showed normal muscle tone, strength, and deep tendon reflexes (DTRs). Examination of her lower extremities was notable for normal strength, increased muscle tone, and increased DTRs with bilateral sustained patellar and ankle clonus with upgoing toes. Her sensory examination was remarkable for absent proprioception to her knees and absent vibratory sense to her waist, with preserved pinprick and temperature sensation. A dilated ophthalmologic examination was unremarkable. Neurologic exam localized to the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, and was concerning for diffuse cortical involvement. Multiplanar, multisequence T2/FLAIR MRIs of the brain and whole spine with and without intravenous (IV) contrast identified diffuse periventricular white matter changes, prominent basal ganglia involvement, and extensive dorsal white matter lesions extending from C2-T10 of the spinal cord (Figure A,B). Her laboratory evaluations revealed a normal serum vitamin B12 (391 pg/mL; normal 232-1245 pg/mL) and increased folic acid (>20 ng/mL; normal >4.7 ng/mL), significantly elevated serum levels of MMA (165.8 \u03bcmol/L; normal 0.045-0.325 \u03bcmol/L) and tHcy (201.9 \u03bcmol/L; normal 0-12.2 \u03bcmol/L). Her plasma methionine level was 20 \u03bcmol/L (normal 16-34 \u03bcmol/L). A gene-testing panel for intracellular cobalamin metabolism defects identified two pathogenic variants in MMACHC: c.271dupA; p.Arg91LysfsX14 and c.389A > G; p.Tyr130Cys (Figure ).\\nSibling 3 is the 26-year-old sister of the proband (Figure \\n). She was on a regular diet. She had not experienced any acute or chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms or thromboembolic complications. Her physical examination was unremarkable. Her brain and spine MRI imaging were normal. Her biochemical evaluations were notable for normal serum vitamin B12 (1189 pg/mL; normal 232-1245 pg/mL), significantly elevated serum MMA (28.5 \u03bcmol/L; normal 0.045-0.325 \u03bcmol/L) and tHcy levels (162.98 \u03bcmol/L; normal 0-12.2 \u03bcmol/L). She was confirmed to be a compound heterozygote for the same two pathogenic variants in MMACHC as the proband by gene testing (Figure ).\\nSibling 1 is a 29-year-old older sister of the proband (Figure \\n). Her medical history included a hearing impairment of uncertain etiology, unilateral renal hypoplasia, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency (stage 3a). She was on a regular diet. She had not experienced any acute or chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms or thromboembolic events. Her physical examination was unremarkable. Her brain and spine MRI imaging were normal. Her biochemical evaluation was notable for normal serum vitamin B12 level (705 pg/mL; normal 232-1245 pg/mL), elevated serum MMA (60.7 \u03bcmol/L; normal 0.045-0.325 \u03bcmol/L) and tHcy (215 \u03bcmol/L; normal 0-12.2 \u03bcmol/L). She was confirmed to be a compound heterozygote for the same two pathogenic variants in MMACHC as her two siblings by gene testing (Figure \\n).\\nThe proband was started with hydroxocobalamin injection at 1 mg/day (0.02 mg/kg/day), betaine at 250 mg/kg/day, and folic acid at 1 mg/day, which resulted in rapid reduction in serum tHcy and MMA levels during the first three weeks (Figure A,B). After this initial period, however, her serum tHcy and MMA levels plateaued above the normal ranges. The hydroxocobalamin injection dose was then increased to 25 mg daily (0.5 mg/kg/day) to maximize therapeutic effects. Metanx (L-methylfolate, pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate, and methylcobalamin) was also added to the treatment regimen. Her serum tHcy and MMA levels rapidly normalized in about 3 weeks and remained within normal range at 6 months on this regimen, (Figure A,B). Her plasma methionine level increased to 31 \u03bcmol/L (normal: 16-34 \u03bcmol/L) after 2 months of treatment. Her serum vitamin B12 levels were significantly elevated to the range of 1 \u00d7 106 pg/mL (normal, 232-1,245 pg/mL).\\nAfter less than 2-months of high-dose hydroxocobalamin injection, her psychosis was completely resolved. Her urinary function was normalized. The patient was able to ambulate using a walker. Her neurologic examination was notable for retained strength, lower extremity spasticity, few beats of clonus at the bilateral patellae and ankles, and normalized vibratory and proprioceptive sensory functions. A repeat brain MRI at 3 months showed much reduced periventricular white matter lesion burden and less conspicuous T2 hyperintense signals in the basal ganglia (Figure C). A repeat spine MRI showed similar dorsal column involvement but with a much smaller cross-section extending from C2-T10 levels (Figure D). The patient's neurological status continued to improve with high-dose hydroxocobalamin treatment and intensive physical rehabilitation. After 4-months of treatment, she was able to ambulate unassisted; however, her lower extremity spasticity persisted. Neurocognitive testing showed IQ within the normal range. Her high-dose injections are being continued at 25 mg/day until she has achieved a full neurologic recovery or has shown no further improvement for several months.\\nSiblings 1 and 3 were treated with the same hydroxocobalamin injection regimen at 25 mg daily, together with oral supplementation with betaine, folic acid, and Metanx. Both patients tolerated this regimen without any complications. Their abnormal serum MMA and tHcy levels were corrected within 3 weeks of treatment (Figure C,D). Their hydroxocobalamin injections were successfully spaced out to 25 mg weekly and their serum MMA and tHcy levels remained in good metabolic control (Figure C,D).", "age": "[[28.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'30197982': 1, '12210350': 1, '21748409': 1, '23301732': 1, '16311595': 1, '9266389': 1, '30863077': 1, '9470012': 1, '19370762': 1, '19821145': 1, '21697092': 1, '33324334': 1, '30782345': 1, '24599607': 1, '31092259': 1, '20632110': 1, '27905001': 1, '25398587': 2, '18245139': 1, '23746552': 1, '34652574': 1, '27252276': 1, '31497484': 1, '8492341': 1, '16990190': 1, '3257264': 1, '32071835': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4255922-1': 1, '4255922-2': 1, '4255922-3': 1}"}
