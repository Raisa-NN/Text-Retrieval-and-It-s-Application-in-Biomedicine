A 4 cm mass in the right ascending colon, near the hepetic flexure was found and biopsied by colonoscopy and pathology confirmed it as adenocarcinoma. The pathology report also revealed BRAF-wild type, Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS)-wild type and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumor, and a diagnosis of lynch syndrome was made. A presurgical staging 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose-PET/CT (FDG-PET/CT) found increased metabolic activity in the cervical, axillary, mediastinal, supraclavicular, para-aortic and mesenteric lymph nodes [Figures and ]. He underwent a right hemicolectomy. Fine needle aspiration of the cervical, axillary, mediastinal, supraclavicular, and para-aortic lymph nodes was done and the results were consistent with metastatic colon adenocarcinoma. He had chemotherapy with folinic acid (leucovorin), fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan (FOLFIRI). After 12 cycles of FOLFIRI, a restaging FDG-PET/CT found interval decrease in size and metabolic activity in cervical, mediastinal, axillary, supraclavicular and mesenteric lymph nodes [Figures and ]. Four additional cycles of chemotherapy are planned for this patient.", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20631828': 1, '21681432': 1, '20138539': 1, '21468765': 1, '10813118': 1, '9632287': 1, '16518827': 1, '25253942': 1, '25161766': 1, '17327285': 1, '26420998': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
