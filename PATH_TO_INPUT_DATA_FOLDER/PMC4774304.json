Clinical examination of the newborn revealed the presence of a pink, bilobed, pedunculated, nontender smooth surfaced mass with a firm consistency arising from the right side of the maxillary alveolar ridge []. Respiratory distress was not evident, but the child had sucking problems. In discussion with the pediatrician and anesthetist, surgical excision was planned under general anesthesia. After preoperative evaluation, surgical excision of the mass was done by the use of cautery after orotracheal intubation under general anesthesia [] on the 5th day of life without any complications. The examination of the resected specimen showed a bilobular, encapsulated, smooth mass which was pedunculated. On histological examination, the tissue was seen to be composed of sheets of large polygonal granular cells with distinct borders, having abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and predominantly eccentrically located vesicular nuclei with conspicuous nucleoli [Figures and ]. Infant was able to commence feeding on the second postoperative day and was discharged on his 8th day of life with normal closure of the mouth and was able to suck normally. The postoperative period was uneventful with infant not showing any signs of recurrence after 4 months of follow-up.", "age": "[[3.0, 'day']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12961042': 1, '4175298': 1, '14370780': 1, '18424116': 1, '11158496': 1, '6282735': 1, '12940383': 1, '2732884': 1, '15635567': 1, '34719988': 2, '9431537': 1, '12731638': 1, '17011257': 1, '15533573': 1, '18556098': 1, '20130770': 2, '8355095': 1, '26980979': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2809329-1': 1, '8562647-1': 1}"}
