Pre-operative investigations included an X-ray pelvis to document pubic diastasis, X-ray spine and ultrasonography abdomen for upper tract evaluation. After obtaining informed and written consent, child was operated under general anaesthesia. Ureteric cannulation tried with no 5 infant feeding tubes but could not be negotiated due to stenotic ureteric orifice. Hence, ureteric catheters (3 Fr) were cannulated bilaterally. Circum bladder incision was given. The incision was deepened from the cephalad extent and a plane was created between the peritoneum and the bladder wall to allow an accurate dissection of the bladder muscle off the edge of the rectus abdominus on either side. Bladder plate mobilized completely after dividing the bladder ligaments. Metaplastic mucosa excised and bladder closure carried out in two layers after placing no 14 Mallicot's catheter as suprapubic cystostomy. Both the ureteric catheters and Mallicot's catheter were fixed to bladder wall and skin. A prevesical corrugated rubber drain was placed and wound closed in layers. Epispadias and bladder neck repair was not attempted.\\nFirst post-operative day was uneventful with all stents draining with urine output more than 1 ml/kg/h. On day 2, child started having mild abdominal distension and tachypnea for which X-ray abdomen and chest antero-posterior view was done. Both the ureteric catheters were normal in position and there was blunting of right costo-phrenic angle due to hydrothorax []. As the severity of symptoms increased rapidly over few hours, urgent ultasonography was carried out, which showed gross urinary ascites with a right pleural effusion, bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and migration of right ureteric catheter to the right thoracic cavity. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis was carried out, which showed features of metabolic acidosis. Urgent tapping of 150 ml fluid was carried out from an abdomen and a pleural cavity. A chest and abdomen X-ray were carried out, which showed clearing of pleural effusion on the right side and right ureteric catheter was found to be migrated to the right thoracic cavity and left ureteric catheter was found just below the left diaphragm []. Ureteric catheters were removed and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies were carried out under ultrasonographic guidance []. ABG parameters improved within few hours. Respiratory distress and abdominal distension also improved within 24 h. Rest of hospital stay in the post-operative period was uneventful.", "age": "[[2.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18715589': 1, '11371991': 1, '9719305': 1, '34246259': 2, '10492227': 1, '10971283': 1, '25659564': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8272335-1': 1}"}
