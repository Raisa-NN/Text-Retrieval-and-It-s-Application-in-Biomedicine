She described it as sharp, stabbing pain of 8/10 on severity scale. She mentioned that she has experienced this type of pain before, but it has been three years since her last episode. She was unable to consume solid foods without \u201cdebilitating\u201d nausea, but denied vomiting. The patient mentioned that her first episode of pancreatitis was at the age of seven when she underwent surgery for pancreatic cyst drainage. Family history was also unremarkable. She has an 11 pack year smoking history but denied alcohol intake. Her vitals were as follow: blood pressure of 132/80 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, 94% oxygen saturation, and a temperature of 98.6 F. Patient weighed 247 lbs with a BMI of 36.49. Abdominal examination revealed a large scar in the center of the abdomen with bowel sounds present in all quadrants. Her abdomen was soft, and non-distended but presented with guarding and tenderness, which was especially tender in the left and right upper quadrants radiating to the umbilicus. She had a negative Murphy sign. Her labs were consistent with elevated lipase and amylase. Computed tomography examination conducted in 2010 and 2017 showed evidence of pancreatitis. In the CT study performed in 2017, there was a 10-mm calcification discovered in the head of the pancreas that was not seen in the 2010 study. We suggested magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) radiological analysis for the patient which displayed a dilated pancreatic head with a maximal diameter of 6-mm. The MRCP findings demonstrated a small amount of fluid between the pancreatic head and proximal descending duodenum, as well as the posterior border of the liver and diaphragm consistent with pancreatitis. The MRCP also showed evidence of a small remnant communication between the dorsal duct (which becomes the main source of drainage in pancreatic divisum) and the ventral duct.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'32963664': 1, '12508340': 1, '23946595': 1, '18442507': 1, '23264525': 1, '32733571': 1, '19037565': 1, '34163563': 1, '34038204': 2, '29375942': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8161893-1': 1}"}
