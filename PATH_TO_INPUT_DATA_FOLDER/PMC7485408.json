A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen (Figure ) demonstrated diffuse low-density ascites in the pelvis, left flank (white arrows) and the perihepatic space (black arrows). Region of interest (ROI) 1 in the perihepatic space revealed a mean density of \u2013139 Hounsfield units (HU) compared to \u2013100 HU in the ROI 2 measured in the contiguous abdominal fat. A 5-cm right ovarian mass containing fat and calcifications was also demonstrated (arrowheads). Neither biological nor imaging signs of intra-abdominal inflammation were noted. The diagnosis of intraperitoneal rupture of an ovarian mature teratoma was made and the patient was discharged.\\nA second CT was performed three months later for persistent abdominal tenderness. It showed more organized fat zones along the mesenteric vessels, surrounding the intestine and mostly prevailing in the upper part of the abdominal cavity, under the diaphragm (Figure , arrows). Signs of chronic peritonitis were also visible (Figure ), including infiltration of the intra-abdominal fat (arrows) combined with smooth thickening and enhancement of the peritoneum (arrowhead). The patient finally underwent a surgical resection confirming a ruptured right ovarian mature teratoma and diffuse oily ascites.", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'31212220': 1, '32964191': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
