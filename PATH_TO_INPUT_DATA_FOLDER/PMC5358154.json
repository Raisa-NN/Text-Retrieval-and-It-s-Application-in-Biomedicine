He received intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg 8 hourly for 3 days with a cumulative dose of 4.5 g. Prior to acyclovir administration, his complete blood picture (CBP), hepatic, and renal parameters are normal. After 3 days of administration of acyclovir, he developed anuria, progressive shortness of breath, and peripheral edema. Acyclovir-induced renal dysfunction was contemplated. On investigating, his CBP showed anemia (hemoglobin 8.5 g/dl), thrombocytopenia (platelet count 80,000 cells/mm3), and 5% schistocytes in peripheral smear. Urinalysis showed microscopic hematuria with a mild proteinuria (0.8 g/day) and no evidence of crystals. Renal function test revealed serum creatinine of 6.6 mg/dl with normal electrolyte levels. Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated (840 IU/L) with decreased haptoglobin levels. His liver function tests were normal, and Coomb's test was negative. Autoimmune workup including serum rheumatoid arthritis factor, antinuclear antibody, dsDNA, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies did not yield positive results. Serum complement levels were normal. HIV, hepatitis A virus, and hepatitis B virus infections were ruled out. ADAMTS13 levels were not studied. Renal biopsy revealed global glomerular capillary thrombosis [Figure \u2013] with acute interstitial nephritis [Figure and ]. Small arterioles had arteriolar thickening associated with fibrinoid necrosis [] and luminal thrombosis. These features are pathognomonic of arterial TMA. After seven sessions of hemodialysis and three sessions of plasmapheresis, serum creatinine is stable at 4.0 mg/dl with urine output of 1 L/day.", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'93183': 1, '10225250': 1, '3376977': 1, '12192020': 1, '20862348': 2, '28356666': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2939444-1': 1}"}
