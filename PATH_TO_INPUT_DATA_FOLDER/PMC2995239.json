He was delivered by Caesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation and his birth weight was 3.2 kg. After birth, bradycardia due to congenital heart block was noted. At the age of 3 days, a permanent VVI pacemaker was implanted due to a resting heart rate of 50-60 beats/min, which was accompanied by LV dilatation and low-LV ejection fraction (EF) of 41%. After VVI pacing, LV dilatation and dysfunction had been improved.\\nAt the age of 9 yr, LV dilatation and dysfunction were detected. He was referred to our outpatient department for further management of LV dysfunction. When he first visited our institution, he had not complained specific symptoms. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was II or I, occasionally. The cardiac examination revealed regular heart beat without murmur. The liver was impalpable.\\nElectrocardiogram showed VVI paced wide QRS complex of 164 msec with left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern of QRS morphology and superior axis at frontal plane. Test weaning of ventricular pacing revealed intrinsic rhythm of complete heart block with wide QRS escape beats ().\\nEchocardiography revealed severe LV dilation with paradoxical septal motion. LV EF measured by the biplane Simpson method was 25.1% (). Dyskinesia of interventricular septum was also found (). There was significant intraventricular dyssynchrony as follows: septal to lateral delay was 136 msec and all segment delay measured by tissue synchrony image (TSI) was 219 msec.\\nChest radiography showed a cardiomegaly, of which cardiothoracic (CT) ratio was 0.61 (). The level of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 111 pg/mL. Screening for fluorescent antinuclear antibodies (FANA) and anti double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ds-DNA) antibodies was negative. Both anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies were also negative. When we have examined his mother, the results were as follows: FANA 1:40, anti ds-DNA antibodies 6.0 and anti-SSA/Ro and SSB/La antibodies (+).\\nWe started to prescribe enalapril to him. Because LV EF remained below 30% on echocardiography in spite of medical treatment for 1 yr, we decided to use CRT in an attempt to improve cardiac function and acquire the reversed remodeling.\\nHe received an epicardial biventricular pacing system with bipolar leads (InSync\u00ae III model 8042, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) with DDD mode via median sternotomy. The epicardial bipolar atrial lead and the bipolar ventricular lead were placed on the right atrial (RA) appendage and the RV apex, respectively. The left lead was placed on the LV posteriolateral wall, between the posterior descending artery and the branches of left circumflex artery. In choosing pacing sites, in order for optimal synchronization in LV walls, we considered TSI by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and arterial pressure monitoring that brought about minimal dyssynchrony and maximal arterial pressure. The pacing thresholds of RA and LV were 1.0 V and 1.5 V respectively with 0.4 msec pacing width. Minimum intraventricular dyssynchrony was achieved with the setting of LV earlier by VV delay 4 msec.\\nTwelve months after implantation, electrocardiogram showed atrial-sensing and ventricular-pacing QRS complex of 148 msec (). Echocardiographic evaluation demonstrated improved myocardial synchronicity and performance (). LV EF was 59.3% (). Septal to LV lateral delay decreased from 136 msec to -10 msec on TSI. In addition, the heart size was decreased as well. Chest radiography showed a CT ratio of 0.51 (). Plasma BNP level decreased to 32 pg/mL.\\nNow, 18 months later from the implantation, he shows the improved exercise tolerance. He has been followed up at the outpatient department and observed on a regular basis. Currently he is in a treatment of the combination therapy using enalapril and carvedilol.", "age": "[[9.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19915220': 1, '17254646': 1, '16360058': 1, '16989648': 1, '19307198': 1, '12633819': 1, '15583083': 1, '11259720': 1, '12495391': 1, '15089999': 1, '11153745': 1, '11263619': 1, '15541267': 1, '12063368': 1, '21165300': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
