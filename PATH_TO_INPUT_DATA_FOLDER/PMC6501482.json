The imaging incidentally revealed an oval axillary mass measuring 4.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 1 cm, with slightly lobulated wall, isointense in a T1 sequence, slightly heterogeneously hyperintense with low-signal intensity rows in a T2 sequence, and round millimetric hypointense structures in the lower part. Of note, there was a marked contrast enhancement in a T1 gadolinium sequence, without invasion of adjacent structures. Physical examination confirmed a mobile, well-delimited, painless axillary adenopathy. Ultrasonography () confirmed an oval lesion with regular delimitation, with a heterogeneous aspect comprising a hypoechogenic focus in the caudal portion and small calcifications combined with hypervascularization in Doppler imaging. Mammography performed at the same time was without any pathological lesions. Histological analysis after surgical excision showed an encapsulated mass of 3.9 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 2.0 cm, with white to brown areas and cystic appearance on macroscopic examination. The final histological diagnosis of an intranodal hemangioma of CCH type was made following special stains and immunohistochemical confirmation ().", "age": "[[44.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22208495': 1, '21111641': 1, '25487937': 1, '19020874': 1, '20667929': 1, '2939107': 1, '1373579': 1, '10884638': 1, '28090794': 1, '21266086': 2, '10961181': 1, '10494525': 1, '7063565': 1, '30003092': 1, '26783326': 1, '23696945': 1, '9285419': 1, '27454944': 1, '26055853': 1, '20466500': 1, '31105947': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3037908-1': 1}"}
