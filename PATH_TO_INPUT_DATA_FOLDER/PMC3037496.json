An examination initiated by the disability support worker and carried out by her own general practitioner produced an MRSA-positive nasal swab. Following successful MRSA decolonization, she returned to her workplace. Three months later, routine screening of the children again revealed the presence of MRSA. Having tested positive again (presence of MRSA in the nose and throat), the disability support worker then received treatment with antibiotics. A week after treatment had been completed, she showed symptoms of sinusitis, accompanied by coughing, coughing attacks, and an irritable, persistent cough. Sinubronchitis due to MRSA was diagnosed, which then developed into pulmonary bronchitis. A year later, COPD had developed. The disability support worker was unable to continue in her work and left her profession.", "age": "[[51.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18494098': 1, '25180133': 1, '14510251': 1, '18446675': 1, '25477910': 1, '15498166': 1, '18994676': 1, '30261854': 1, '24996225': 1, '23710905': 1, '12828325': 1, '29213999': 1, '17540751': 1, '27350233': 1, '28068356': 1, '32536812': 1, '34660146': 1, '16950365': 1, '19392953': 1, '19667289': 1, '22553942': 1, '25285266': 1, '9152824': 1, '8228149': 1, '16019268': 1, '30923557': 1, '31358421': 1, '28030828': 1, '23933823': 1, '24159314': 1, '30486322': 1, '18471774': 1, '18462089': 1, '3764350': 1, '9227864': 1, '21599908': 1, '21212973': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3037496-1': 2}"}
