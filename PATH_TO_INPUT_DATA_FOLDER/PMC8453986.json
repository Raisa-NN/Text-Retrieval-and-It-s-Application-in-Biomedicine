Dermatoscopy showed non-specific features with a hyperpigmented area and irregularly distributed brown/black globules on a pinkish background (Fig. ). RCM showed an atypical honeycomb pattern and edged dermal papillae appearing as bright rings in the absence of junctional and dermal nests of melanocytic cells (Fig. ). The cytological atypia of keratinocytes and the absence of diagnostic confocal features of melanocytic lesion supported the diagnosis of keratinocyte carcinoma. Histopathological examination of an incisional biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of pigmented Bowen disease (Fig. ).", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29806189': 1, '26801517': 1, '15339086': 1, '15879790': 1, '25546495': 1, '15537454': 1, '33970486': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8453986-1': 2}"}
