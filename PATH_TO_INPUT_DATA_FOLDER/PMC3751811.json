The woman had no medical history, and no family history, of breast cancer. A physical examination revealed a palpable mass in her right breast measuring 10 mm to 15 mm in size, not fixed to underlying tissues and not involving the overlying skin. Her contralateral breast and axilla were normal on clinical examination. On mammography, the mass was well demarcated (Figure ). Her liver ultrasound scan, chest X-ray and bone scintigraphy were normal. An incisional biopsy was performed and the histological examination showed abundant cartilaginous proliferation varying from mature cartilage to poorly differentiated areas (Figure ). An immunohistochemical study was performed and immunoreactivity was detected for vimentin but not for AE1/AE3, CK7, and estrogen and progesterone receptors. There was also no overexpression of the HER-2/neuoncoprotein. A final diagnosis of chondrosarcoma of the breast was made with the absence of phyllodes tumor or carcinoma in the whole tumor. Our patient underwent a mastectomy.", "age": "[[24.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'433839': 1, '25663866': 2, '20847886': 1, '3977455': 1, '7702669': 1, '1593140': 1, '21462188': 1, '29159207': 1, '34447479': 1, '20585866': 1, '11373590': 1, '4294611': 1, '23084962': 1, '25858932': 1, '28402910': 1, '23964821': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4315059-1': 1}"}
