The surface of the SMT resembled the surrounding normal colonic mucosa with regard to color and appearance, with multiple red patches (Fig. ). Narrow-band imaging revealed a few telangiectasias on the surface of the SMT (Fig. ); however, additional characteristics of the SMT could not be determined. The lesion could not be definitively diagnosed based on the endoscopic findings. Therefore, the SMT was removed by snare polypectomy with electrocautery after clipping the basal portion of the tumor stalk for prophylactic hemostasis, for more accurate diagnosis (Fig. ). Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed that the SMT was covered by normal colonic mucosa (Fig. ) and showed numerous dilated blood vessels in the mucosa and submucosa (Fig. ). The vascular epithelium of the dilated vessels did not reveal any malignant changes. Edematous stroma was observed in the submucosa. The SMT was diagnosed as a cavernous hemangioma (Fig ) with a negative resection margin.", "age": "[[69.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17502196': 1, '26190000': 1, '15806421': 1, '11641173': 1, '10403856': 1, '30978732': 1, '12239062': 1, '16462311': 1, '6734365': 1, '7215080': 1, '4741864': 1, '6641466': 1, '31616236': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
