The incisional hernia was repaired with laparoscopic polypropylene mesh hernioplasty and 1 month after the surgery, he had developed the chronic discharging sinus. He was treated conservatively for more than 6 months without any result before presenting to our hospital. On fistulogram the dye entered the transverse colon. Therefore, he was planned for an exploratory laparotomy [Figures and ].\\nThe abdomen was opened through a mid-line incision following a no. 10 infant feeding tube placed in the fistula tract. As expected, a part of the culprit polypropylene mesh was found to have eroded the mid-transverse colon, causing fistula.\\nPrimary resection and end-to-end anastomosis of the transverse colon were done along with the removal of the polypropylene mesh and the fistulous tract. Abdomen was closed with non-absorbable sutures.\\nPost-operative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the eighth post-operative day, with follow-up at regular intervals.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'8673302': 1, '29380158': 1, '10434463': 1, '27011528': 1, '26239722': 2, '31031328': 1, '9565117': 1, '21254024': 1, '12496539': 1, '23626421': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4524372-1': 1}"}
