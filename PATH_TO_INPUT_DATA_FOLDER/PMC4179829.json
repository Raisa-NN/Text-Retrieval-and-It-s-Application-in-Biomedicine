MGFA grade was 3a (QMG score of 21, at its most severe). Although several medical treatments were administered, right external ophthalmoplegia with severe blepharoptosis, and mild left blepharoptosis did not improve. At 77 years of age, the patient demonstrated fixed heterophoria (). Furthermore, the right eye was blinded due to optic neuritis (etiology unknown), and Bell\u2019s phenomenon was absent. Levator function was 0 mm in the right eye and 10 mm in the left, while MRD was 0 and 3.0 mm, respectively. Although the right eye had lost visual function, the patient desired blepharoptosis surgery for esthetic purposes. Hence, frontal suspension, using nylon sutures, with upper eyelid skin resection was performed on the right eye, while external levator advancement was performed on the left eye. In the right eye, care was taken not to excessively elevate the eyelid, to avoid postoperative corneal exposure. Although the heterophoria became more apparent (), the patient felt \u201cmuch easier\u201d eyelid opening in the left eye and was \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with both the esthetic and functional outcome. Since the right eye was nonfunctional, diplopia did not develop postoperatively.", "age": "[[47.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'4644732': 1, '21491460': 1, '22553417': 1, '11281581': 1, '10891897': 1, '11268023': 1, '8618762': 1, '20181539': 1, '23235620': 1, '17452847': 1, '3952195': 1, '6651238': 1, '18071049': 1, '22806364': 1, '10815146': 1, '17460154': 1, '33329368': 1, '24503883': 1, '11257479': 1, '18697209': 1, '6538004': 1, '25278744': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4179829-1': 2, '4179829-2': 2, '4179829-3': 2, '4179829-4': 2}"}
