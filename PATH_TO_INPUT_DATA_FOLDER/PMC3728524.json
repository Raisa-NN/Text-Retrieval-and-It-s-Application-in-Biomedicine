There were no abnormalities in the physical examination and on biochemical parameters. Pelvic CT revealed a 5 cm heterogeneous mass in the right wall and base of the bladder (). Cystoscopy revealed massive smooth polyp with papillary area on the posterior wall of bladder. Therefore, transurethral resection of the bladder was performed. Histology of the tumor was diagnosed as carcinosarcoma composed of biphasic malignant epithelial and mesenchymal elements (). Tumor is large and polypoidal with surface necrosis and deep muscle invasion of the bladder wall. With these findings the patient underwent radical cystoprostatectomy and ileal conduit operation. Additionally, pelvic lymph node dissection was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed that tumor was diagnosed as carcinosarcoma and the tumor had invaded the lamina propria, but it had not invaded the muscle. After an uneventful early postoperative period, the patient, biochemical parameters, and imaging findings were good in the follow-up controls, 15 months postoperatively.", "age": "[[84.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9554341': 1, '20706685': 1, '10720865': 1, '8367621': 1, '5217046': 1, '17199866': 1, '14692829': 1, '1772053': 1, '17936803': 1, '33727576': 1, '9554532': 1, '11157016': 1, '23956923': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
