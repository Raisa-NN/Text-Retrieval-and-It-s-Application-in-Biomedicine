Her medical history was unremarkable. Preoperative blood tests, chest radiography, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination were normal. Premedication, anesthesia induction, maintenance, and monitoring were the same as Case 1. After the patient was placed in the lithotomy position, carbon dioxide was injected into the peritoneal cavity via a veress needle until peritoneal pressure reach 12 mmHg. Her bladder was observed to be tethered up on the uterus via laparoscopy. Marked gaseous distention of the urinary bag which was filled with 350 ml was noticed 30 minutes after the operation started. Laparoscopy revealed a 1.5 cm hole in the dome of the bladder including the mucosa layer. Urine leakage or hematuria was not found. Bladder perforation was diagnosed with a conversion to a laparotomy. Total hysterectomy and bladder repair was performed. The urine volume after bladder repair was 150 ml. The vital signs were stable in the operation and recovery room. She discharged on postoperative day 5 with a foley catheter. The foley catheter was removed after there was no more urine leakage as determined by cystoscopy on postoperative day 13.", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8483230': 1, '8141464': 1, '1419022': 1, '10924641': 1, '7614650': 1, '9721764': 1, '9003958': 1, '9513988': 1, '4279556': 1, '21602979': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3092964-1': 2}"}
