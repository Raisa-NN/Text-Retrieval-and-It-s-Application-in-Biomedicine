There was a history of bluish discoloration of fingers and lips for the past 5 years. There was no history of breathlessness. On examination, the patient was thin built; peripheral pulses were normal, blood pressure 95/72 mmHg, with normal S1 and S2. There was central cyanosis in lips and nails and grade 2 clubbing was present. There was no evidence of mucocutanious telangiectasis. Examination of cardiopulmonary and nervous system was essentially normal. Hemoglobin was 16.8g/dl with normal methemoglobin of 2%. Chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were reported to be normal by pulmonologists. Arterial blood gas analysis at room air showed pH 7.20, PO\\n2\\n 58.8 mmHg, PCO\\n2\\n 40.3 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 88%.\\nContrast echocardiographic study was performed, but did not reveal any significant anomaly. Cardiac catheterization was performed and injection of contrast media in the main pulmonary artery showed immediate opacification of the left atrium and small haziness in the left lung. Selective injection of contrast media in left pulmonary artery demonstrated the PAVM in superior lingula of the left lung (\\n). Successful transcatheter embolization was attempted in the patient and resulted in resolution of cyanosis during 6 moths follow up.", "age": "[[10.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11174338': 1, '11061251': 1, '8456028': 1, '4834927': 1, '7894484': 1, '3243053': 1, '10807828': 1, '3186989': 1, '9700146': 1, '7872588': 1, '6349562': 1, '11171725': 1, '21532721': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2984296-1': 2}"}
