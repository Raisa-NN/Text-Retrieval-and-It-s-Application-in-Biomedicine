An appendectomy was performed under the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis. During the operation, a tumor was observed in the colon. The operation was aborted because of an inability to remove the tumor. Two days later, a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed the mass arising from the ascending colon. The regional enlarged lymph nodes and metastases in the liver were noted (Figure ).\\nThe patient was transferred to our hospital for treatment. Tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen 19\u20139 (CA 19\u20139) and CA 125, were in the normal range. His serum beta human chorionic growth hormone (\u03b2-HCG) level was 3.38 mIU/ml. A colonoscopy revealed a yellow tumor in the colon (Figure ) and endoscopic biopsy findings suggested a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. After two days, a colectomy was performed. The tumor located in the ascending colon measured 4 cm \u00d7 5 cm and penetrated the serosa and the mesocolic fat, with 12 adjacent enlarged lymph nodes. The pathologic findings showed that the tumor invaded the serosa of the intestinal wall and was composed of syncytiotrophoblastic cells, cytotrophoblast-like cells and intermediate trophoblastic cells. Necrosis and hemorrhage were also noted in the mass. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for HCG and negative for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, villin, caudal type homeobox 2, \u03b1-fetoprotein and CD30 (Figure ). Metastasis was found in the liver and in eight of the excised lymph nodes.\\nSystemic chemotherapy using bleomycin, etoposide and platinum was performed. Chemotherapy engaging etoposide phosphate 100 mg, cisplatin 30 mg, bleomycin 18 mg was initiated. The \u03b2-hCG level increased from 3.38 to 10,000 mIU/ml after the first course of chemotherapy, and CT showed another mass in the liver. After three cycles of chemotherapy, his \u03b2-hCG level remained high. Because of the progression of disease, the patient and his family abandoned other alternative regimens of chemotherapy.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27462191': 1, '7200001': 1, '33042351': 1, '16780096': 1, '21090526': 1, '27313687': 1, '8717221': 1, '30410393': 1, '33269267': 2, '33344291': 2, '22075658': 1, '33530802': 2, '2429544': 1, '26218175': 1, '33128732': 1, '12576901': 1, '33190644': 2, '15668903': 1, '6362401': 1, '8726837': 1, '15274374': 1, '24151399': 1, '11417994': 1, '29205146': 1, '25018640': 1, '6540137': 1, '7190461': 1, '6541765': 1, '4039056': 1, '23356395': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7703162-1': 1, '7667771-1': 1, '7674725-1': 1, '7871072-1': 1}"}
