The lesion was of a small size (1 \u00d7 2 cm size) as shown in Fig. . However, no sensory alteration or temperature hypersensitivity was observed. The patient denied any family history of similar condition or traumatic injury to the forearm. The swelling was excised (Fig. ). Interestingly, a superficial vein was feeding the lesion. Therefore, the feeding vein was cauterized and the lesion was sent for histopathology that confirms the diagnosis of intravascular glomus tumor.", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22665877': 1, '11145243': 1, '8227612': 1, '26955123': 1, '1847561': 1, '21381525': 1, '1321179': 1, '23285458': 1, '24624306': 2, '9243367': 1, '31155303': 1, '30154627': 1, '27421300': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3929381-1': 1}"}
