This significant change in size was noted 1 month prior to presentation with accompanying numbness of the left half of her lip. She was otherwise healthy (not on any medication) and her past medical and social history (she did not have risk habits such as tobacco smoking, betel chewing, smokeless tobacco, and alcohol) did not reveal any significant contributions to her current presentation. She was a homemaker and had two children. Exploration of her family history did not reveal that a similar pathology affected her parents, siblings, and children.\\nA general examination of our patient revealed no significant findings and all vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, and respiratory rate) were within normal range. A well-defined, 4 \u00d7 4 cm swelling with redness on the overlying skin was noted on her submental region towards the left side. On intraoral examination, extensions of the same swelling measured 2 \u00d7 1.2 cm in size and involved the 31, 32, 41, and 42 teeth. No skin involvement was noted and the swelling appeared to be ill defined. The swelling was bony hard in consistency. Neurosensory evaluation revealed loss of sensation for fine touch, pressure, and temperature in lower left-sided labial skin.\\nThese changes of recent onset were suspected to be an infection of an odontogenic cyst of her mandible and a cone beam computed tomography (CT) was performed. The results showed an irregular radiolucent lesion involving most of her mandible from the 35 to the 47 region. In the anterior part, both buccal and lingual cortical bone erosion was seen from the 33 to the 44 teeth of the mandible (Figs. and ). Except in the anterior part, very little buccolingual expansion was seen that suggested a KCOT. The roots of the 34 and the 44 teeth were involved in the lesion but no root reabsorption was evident.\\nRoutine hematological investigations were carried out (full blood count, serum electrolytes, and liver function test) with renal function test and the results were well within limits.\\nAn incisional biopsy revealed a SCC arising from a preexisting KCOT. An ultrasound scan and a CT scan of the bilateral neck revealed no metastasis migration to the neck nodes (T4N0M0).\\nFollowing incision biopsy, left-side neck dissection (levels I to III) and segmental mandibulectomy to include a bony and a soft tissue margin of 1 cm were performed. The bony and soft tissue defects were reconstructed with a titanium reconstruction plate and a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. Her recovery was uneventful. She had mild discomfort during the first few months following surgery and adapted to the changes subsequently. Close to the 16 months\u2019 review, the titanium plate was seen externalizing intraorally. She complained of a mild pain during wide opening of her mouth due to the reconstruction plate. She had been routinely reviewed in the clinic with 1-month review intervals and currently she has been disease free for the last 18 months; a free fibula flap is planned for the mandibular reconstruction.\\nOn histopathologic examination the lesion was reported as a moderately differentiated SCC arising from a KCOT (Figs. , , and ). Complete excision of the lesion was reported in the biopsy and the left-side neck nodes of all three levels were negative.\\nPostoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy was not prescribed considering the histopathology findings (a timeline is shown in Fig. ).", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'5021612': 1, '12058870': 1, '8106809': 1, '4887224': 1, '8062069': 1, '33037806': 1, '21689161': 1, '21493332': 1, '19333185': 1, '18587212': 1, '23717337': 2, '32548170': 1, '29191248': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3660158-1': 1}"}
