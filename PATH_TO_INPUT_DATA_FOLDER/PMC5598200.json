She gave history of washing her hair with powdered custard apple seeds as a remedy for lice after which she developed redness in her left eye. She had consulted someone else and was on antibiotics and lubricants. On examination, her vision was 6/6, N6 and 6/9, N6 in the right and left eye, respectively. Slit lamp evaluation of the left eye revealed loose epithelium with punctate erosions and abrasions (Figure 4 ). Under topical anaesthesia the loose epithelium was scraped with sterile blade (Figure 5 ) and the eye was patched after applying topical antibiotic and lubricating eye ointment. On review the next day, vision had improved to 6/6 and the epithelial defect had healed (Figure 6 ). There was no haze. She was advised to continue lubricants for a week and asked for follow-up after 6 months.", "age": "[[13.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27688289': 2, '22953811': 1, '16021185': 1, '28944154': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5598200-1': 2, '5056555-1': 1, '5056555-2': 1}"}
