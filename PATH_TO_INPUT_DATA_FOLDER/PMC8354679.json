He had been experiencing pain of moderate intensity in the mid third of his left thigh for ~7 days. Symptoms gradually worsened over the last 2 days.\\nHe was a factor V leiden carrier and had a history of cerebral venous thrombosis. He was being treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. He had no other comorbidities. He had no history of smoking had no history of trauma or surgery.\\nOn physical examination, he was tachycardic (103 bpm) with a blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg. We demonstrated a large pulsatile mass of the left upper leg (). His pulses were palpable and there was no evidence of distal embolization.\\nUltrasonography (US) of the left thigh showed an aneurysmal dilatation of the SFA measuring 67 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 80 mm () on the anterior aspect of the proximal third of the thigh. Computer tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed a 64 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 87-mm PSA developed on the anterior side of the proximal left SFA (). The other arterial axes were healthy and normal. Supplementary imaging examinations did not identify any additional aneurysms.\\nAfter a multidisciplinary discussion, we decided to wait until the effect of anticoagulation ceased before operating on the patient.\\nDuring operative intervention, a hematoma was observed involving muscle tissues in the anteromedial region of the thigh. There were no obvious signs of active infection. The proximal control obtained, the aneurysm incised and the distal control obtained. The aneurysm resected and samples collected for anatomopathological and microbiological analyses (). Reconstruction was performed by interposition of the ipsilateral great saphenous vein in reverse, with end-to-end anastomosis taking into consideration the diameter of the femoral artery (). Intraoperative tissue cultures were negative and the anatomopathological analysis showed a histopathological aspect corresponding to a PSA of the femoral artery, with the absence of the arterial wall and without specific character.\\nAt 2-month follow-up, the patient had palpable distal pulses and was free from pain or other problems. The control echodoppler shows triphasic flow within the left common and superficial femoral arteries.\\nAt 3-month follow-up, he presented to emergency room with a popliteal and left calf pain that has been worsening for 2 days. The echo Doppler revealed a popliteal and femoral deep vein thrombosis, and a left SFA PSA (15 \u00d7 18 mm) circulating with a 5-mm collar ().\\nThe CTA confirmed a PSA measuring 13 mm in diameter ().\\nIn view of the size of the PSA and the asymptomatic character, we decided to treat it by endovascular procedure.\\nUnfortunately, in the meantime, he presented to the emergency room for a swelling of his left thigh since the morning. He had no pain. He was hemodynamically stable. His hemoglobin was 13 g/dl. We examined a large pulsatile mass of the left upper leg. The CTA showed a PSA (8.3 \u00d7 10.7 \u00d7 9 cm) of his left SFA and a hematoma with active bleeding on the anterior aspect of the left thigh, in close contact with the left SFA ().\\nThe patient was operated as an emergency. A voluminous hematoma was observed involving muscle tissues in the anteromedial region of the thigh. Proximal control was obtained, the aneurysm incised and the distal control obtained with a fogarty catheter. The hematoma was evacuated and the PSA was resected. The anatomical structures are hardly recognizable and deformed due to the presence of this important hematoma. Our old venous bypass was not visualized, probably compressed and evacuated with the hematoma. The reconstruction performed by interposition of graft (Dacron 6 mm), with end-to-side anastomosis.", "age": "[[17.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18929043': 1, '17966536': 1, '922623': 1, '24960758': 1, '12218983': 1, '24822070': 2, '23984040': 1, '1636927': 1, '15599633': 1, '27565598': 1, '31236105': 2, '8136594': 1, '21215583': 1, '7362460': 1, '22295419': 1, '4560632': 1, '23825506': 1, '18427657': 1, '17311772': 1, '17533536': 1, '17988902': 1, '15931315': 1, '34386189': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6579521-1': 1, '4009202-1': 1}"}
