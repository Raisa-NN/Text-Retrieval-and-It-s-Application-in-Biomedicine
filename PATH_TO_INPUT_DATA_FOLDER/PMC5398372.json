On arrival, he did not present with any abnormal behavior, and his vital signs were stable: blood pressure, 99/61 mm Hg; heart rate, 109 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute; body temperature, 36.8\u00b0C. Bowel sounds were normal. There was no abdominal tenderness.\\nChest radiography showed one 20-mm metallic foreign body in the stomach (), and emergency endoscopic removal of the foreign body was planned because of the risk of electrical discharge and/or chemical injury []. However, initial attempts at endoscopic retrieval of the button battery failed because of abundant food residue in the stomach resulting from insufficient NPO time.\\nExploration through the food residue, using forceps, failed to locate the button battery; thus, esophagogastroduodenoscopy under fluoroscopic guidance was performed. Fluoroscopic imaging was successful in visualizing the battery in the greater curvature of the stomach, which was removed using alligator forceps and endoscopic basket (Olympus Co.) without complications ().\\nAfter successful conclusion of the procedure, the patient did not exhibit any abnormal behavior and was discharged from the hospital without further medication 4 hours later. At the 1-week outpatient follow-up visit, the patient remained asymptomatic.", "age": "[[1.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26862844': 1, '25805240': 1, '29390302': 2, '26185385': 1, '21515184': 1, '25324918': 1, '21628009': 1, '28008164': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5398372-1': 2, '5815714-1': 1, '5815714-2': 1, '5815714-3': 1, '5815714-4': 1, '5815714-5': 1}"}
