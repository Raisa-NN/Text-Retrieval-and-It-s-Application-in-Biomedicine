Clinical examination results, including audiogram, were not available as a result of the patient's severe lower limb fractures. He had been treated with metformin for 15 years until he was identified as carrying the mt3243A > G mutation in this study. He had higher levels of HbA1c (7.9%) and 2 h postprandial plasma glucose level (12.40 mmol/L). His BMI was 19.2 kg/m2. Self-reported hearing loss was present since the age of 50 without being exposed to noise, and the patient reported the development of blurred vision at the age of 62. Genetic testing of his family members revealed that none of them carried the mt3243A > G mutation. The patient's parents were deceased, and their medical histories of diabetes and the mt3243A > G mutation were not available ().", "age": "[[72.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10485557': 1, '8628477': 1, '9262546': 1, '11733107': 1, '9017352': 1, '9827849': 1, '9594306': 1, '18294221': 1, '15372523': 1, '24803323': 1, '9504470': 1, '9284704': 1, '22492248': 1, '11581015': 1, '8121460': 1, '1360090': 1, '7901716': 1, '7988784': 1, '11240563': 1, '27359089': 1, '2102678': 1, '15199381': 1, '9686693': 1, '18279408': 1, '28713835': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5497653-1': 2}"}
