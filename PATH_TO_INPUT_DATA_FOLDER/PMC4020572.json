He visited our hospital when he was 11 years old and was diagnosed with TS in accordance with DSM-IV-TR and his YGTSS was 18. While there was a family history of TD, neither ADHD, OCD, nor other behavioral or psychiatric disorders were identified. He had been treated with haloperidol (1.5 mg/day) for approximately 2 years and showed only mild improvement while the presence of drowsiness prevented further dosage titration. He was prescribed with 3 mg/day of paliperidone ER and showed no improvement in his tic symptoms over the course of 3 weeks following initiation of therapy (YGTSS 16). Subsequently, the dosage of paliperidone ER was increased to 6 mg/day. After 5 weeks of higher dosage of paliperidone ER, he did experience mild drowsiness but significant improvement of the tic symptoms was observed (YGTSS 6). Due to the presence of the mild drowsiness, the dosage of paliperidone ER was then reduced to 3 mg/day and, despite this reduction, his tic symptoms did not recur over the following 4 months (YGTSS 7).", "age": "[[13.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10972415': 1, '14725596': 1, '17460786': 1, '17217317': 1, '15319022': 1, '14726728': 1, '8599393': 1, '11235929': 1, '12153825': 1, '24047427': 1, '21445724': 1, '2768151': 1, '17690599': 1, '20035580': 1, '23438169': 1, '16331353': 1, '25934008': 1, '11587872': 1, '16554257': 1, '11799340': 1, '17667475': 1, '11009331': 1, '24829608': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4020572-1': 2, '4020572-2': 2}"}
