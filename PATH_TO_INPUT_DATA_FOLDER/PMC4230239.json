The patient had noticed the mass for 1 month. The mass grew rapidly from the extraction socket of the lower mandibular second molar. Past medical history revealed hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which were adequately controlled with medication. The patient\u2019s family history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a rubbery sessile mass measuring 20 \u00d7 15 mm on the left mandible (Figure ). The overlying oral mucosa looked absent. There was neither neuroparalysis nor cervical lymphadenopathy.\\nMRI examination was performed with a 1.5 Tesla system (Intera 1.5 T; Philips Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). On the T1-weighted axial images, the mass appeared isointense and was highly and heterogeneously enhanced with gadolinium in the left mandibular region. On the T2-weighted axial images, it appeared with increased signal intensity. On short-tau inversion recovery coronal imaging, the mass also showed high signal intensity (Figure ). The CT images (Brilliance CT 16; Philips Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) showed no bony changes of the mandible (Figure ). The PET study was performed with a dedicated PET scanner (ECAT ACCEL; Siemens Healthcare AG, Munich, Germany). Data were acquired after administration of 181.5 MBq 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), using the post-injection transmission acquisition method. The image showed abnormal strong accumulation of FDG in the left mandibular region with a maximum standard uptake value of 8.5. There were no abnormal accumulations of FDG in the cervical lymph nodes nor was there any uptake in the other organs (Figure A). The PET/CT fusion images showed that abnormal strong FDG accumulation corresponded to the mass on the left mandible (Figure B).\\nIn November 2010, the biopsy was performed under local anesthesia. The pathological diagnosis was myofibroblastic tumor, probably benign. However, the mass enlarged rapidly to 35 \u00d7 25 mm within 3 weeks after biopsy. According to the clinical findings, we could not completely deny the malignancy of the tumor. On 2 December 2010, it was removed by marginal resection of the left mandible under general anesthesia (Figure ).\\nPathological examination of hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections revealed that the tumor was composed of interlacing bundles of spindle-shaped cells. The tumor cells had tapered blunt-ended nuclei with pale-staining eosinophilic cytoplasm. The spindle-shaped cells did not show either cellular atypism or polymegethism. Mitoses were sometimes observed. The stroma contained abundant thin-walled vessels (Figure A,B). Immunohistochemical staining was performed using an avidin-biotin method. Immunoreactivity for vimentin (mouse anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody, clone V9; DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), muscle actin (mouse anti-human muscle actin monoclonal antibody, clone HHF35; DakoCytomation), and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (mouse anti-human alpha smooth muscle actin monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4; Daco, Carpinteria, CA, USA) were positive in the tumor cells. Conversely, S-100 protein (rabbit anti-human S-100 polyclonal antibody, clone MOC32; Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan), desmin (mouse anti-human desmin monoclonal antibody, clone D33; Daco, Kyoto, Japan), and CD34 (mouse anti-human CD34 monoclonal antibody, clone NU-4A1; Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) were negative. Thin-walled vessels were positive for CD34 (Figure C,D,E). These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of myofibroma.\\nThe postoperative course was uneventful, and we found no evidence of recurrence at the postoperative 34-month follow-up.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18417385': 1, '10535535': 1, '23021917': 1, '12789154': 1, '7284977': 1, '10710461': 1, '19246965': 1, '12544246': 1, '11904694': 1, '17150381': 1, '29064415': 2, '16855503': 1, '16649043': 1, '29854892': 2, '18417602': 1, '10630943': 1, '17448141': 1, '22732854': 1, '24678877': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5960738-1': 1, '5664021-1': 1}"}
