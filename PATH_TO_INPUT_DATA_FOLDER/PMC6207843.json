The patient denied prior abdominal surgeries, tobacco or illicit drug use. His history included hospitalization a year earlier for painless rectal bleeding, concerning for ischemic colitis, which was managed non-operatively. Current medications included Aspirin 81 mg and Valsartan-HCTZ. Physical exam revealed only mild left lower quadrant tenderness, and the labs values were quite unremarkable. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast demonstrated a thrombosed dissection, originating 2 cm from the ostium of the SMA with extension into the second and third order branches (Figs and ).\\nThe patient was admitted for observation, non-operative management and intravenous hydration, along with bowel rest with therapeutic anticoagulation. His abdominal pain improved and he was discharged home on hospital Day 5 on aspirin and warfarin.\\nRepeat CT imaging 3 months after this hospitalization continued to show the SMA dissection with resolution of the SMA thrombus (Fig. ). His warfarin was discontinued in exchange for a dual antiplatelet therapy.", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21944909': 1, '17628380': 1, '11305570': 1, '20855179': 1, '29349370': 1, '10742422': 1, '21333559': 1, '19208448': 1, '30397433': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
