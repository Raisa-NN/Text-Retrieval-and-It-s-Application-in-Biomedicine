He was subjected to open right nephrectomy due to persistent pyuria in March 2012. Histopathology revealed chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis leading to end-stage renal disease. He was cleared for transplantation in June 2012. Before placing the renal allograft in the right iliac fossa, an enlarged lymph node was found and sent for histopathology. This was followed by an uneventful transplantation. Histopathology of the lymph node revealed necrotic lymphatic filled with coiled adult worms of Wuchereria bancrofti (microfilaria) () with double uteri in female worms. Subsequently after diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) challenge test, his peripheral blood also showed microfilarial worms (), however he never had tissue/peripheral blood eosinophilia. He was therefore treated with a single dose of 400 mg albendazole followed by DEC, 6 mg/kg body weight for 14 days. Eight months post-transplantation he was maintaining stable graft function with serum creatinine of 1 mg/dL on maintenance immunosuppression of 0.06 mg/kg/day of tacrolimus, 360 mg of mycofenolate sodium twice a day, and 10 mg/day prednisone. On screening, none of his family members had evidence of filariasis.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20832594': 1, '9865372': 1, '18202437': 1, '11064761': 1, '16647449': 1, '25013664': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
