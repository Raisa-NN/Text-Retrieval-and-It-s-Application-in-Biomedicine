On further questioning, the patient denied history of chest pain, but complained of sudden onset generalized weakness and numbness. The patient had developed weakness of his legs and difficulty in passing urine one hour before arriving in the ER. Patient denied recent infections, headaches, nausea, vomiting, trauma or a similar neurological episode before. The patient had end stage renal failure due to poorly controlled diabetes and hypertensive heart disease for many years. He had been on routine hemodialysis thrice a week with each dialyzing session lasting for four hours for the past three years. The last dialysis was done the day prior to presentation. His medications included metoprolol 100 mg twice a day, simvastatin 40 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily and 70/30 insulin 30 units subcutaneously twice a day.\\nOn examination, the patient's had a temperature of 98.2\u00b0F, respiratory rate of 20 per minute, heart rate of 90 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. Examination of the cardiovascular system showed normal heart sounds with no murmurs. The respiratory system and gastrointestinal systems were normal. Central nervous system examination revealed an alert, awake and oriented patient with normal cranial nerve function. He had symmetrical and equal weakness of the lower limbs more than in the upper limbs. The muscle tone and the reflexes were also weaker in the lower limbs compared to the upper limbs. There was no sensory deficit. In the ER, blood tests including chemistry and complete blood count were sent. A bed side EKG and a chest X-ray were performed.\\nBased on the initial two EKG strips done by the EMS and the subsequent two EKGs done in the ER (Figure: , , , ) and the clinical back ground of end stage renal failure the diagnosis of hyperkalaemic flaccid paralysis was made. The patient was given 10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate intravenously followed by 10 units of regular insulin, and 50 ml of 50% dextrose. The patient also received 30 ml of sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) orally that was repeated every hour till the patient developed a diarrhea.\\nSubsequently the patient's blood results showed potassium of 6.2 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 152 mg/dl and creatinine level of 8.50 mg/dl. Patient was rushed for emergency dialysis. After three hours of dialysis, the patient recovered completely from his weakness and was able to walk. His post dialysis potassium level was 4.0 mEq/L, BUN was 47 mg/dl and creatinine was 3.57 mg/dl. The EKG had reversed back to sinus rhythm, heart rate of 88 per minute, normal T waves and ST segment (Figure ).", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'91060': 1, '3998756': 1, '9489541': 1, '3495559': 1, '13106780': 1, '17902552': 1, '1952310': 1, '17890704': 1, '8435272': 1, '17700407': 1, '18845006': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
