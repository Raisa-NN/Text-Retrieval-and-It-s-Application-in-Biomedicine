The young boy was Libyan and he had frequent contact with wild cats.\\nPhysical examination exposed a single rounded plaque of hair loss with white scale on the right parietal scalp area with no erythematous background [].\\nThere were no palpable lymph nodes in the lateral cervical chains. TC was diagnosed with confidence clinically that comes from accumulated experience.\\nThe glass plate of a Handheld Dermlite II Pro dermatoscope examination at 10-fold magnification (low- and high-magnification) was employed with alcohol as the interface medium and the most characteristic findings observed were multiple broken hairs and hairs with a characteristic comma-like shape which is called as comma hairs, pigtail and zigzag hairs, and some corkscrew hairs []. Furthermore, a newly described finding was scarcely seen called \u201cMorse code-like hair\u201d was seen []. The Woods lamp examination yielded a characteristic fluorescence of lighter yellowish-green [].\\nThe patient was administered oral griseofulvin (fulcin syrup) with fatty meals for four consecutive weeks and was followed up after 3 weeks.
