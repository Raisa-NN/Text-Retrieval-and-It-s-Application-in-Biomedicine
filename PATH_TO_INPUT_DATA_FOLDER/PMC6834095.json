She underwent electroneuromyography (ENMG) with axonal motor neuronal involvement in lower limbs without signs of demyelination. CSF serologies were negative (HIV, HTLV, Toxoplasmosis, Tuberculosis, Syphilis, Cryptococcosis, Herpes virus, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Varicella-Zoster virus) and cellularity was normal (0.66), but high protein concentration (183 mg/ml). Magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord were normal.\\nThe patient underwent pulse therapy with dexamethasone for five days, without improvement in the condition and progression of the motor deficit. She was administered intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 2g/kg for five days, with a slight improvement in the strength of the lower limbs. After two days, a new ENMG revealed intense and active denervation of multiple motor nerves and lumbosacral roots (multiradiculoneuropathy) with electrophysiological integrity of the upper limbs.\\nSerum serologies for arboviruses revealed only high levels of IgM for CHK, with the rheumatological tests, serologies and protein electrophoresis of CSF, oncological screening and biochemical findings being normal.\\nShe underwent two new infusions of IVIG, evolved with worsening of strength in the lower limb, loss of trunk strength and upper limbs, as well as osteotendinous hyperreflexia in the four limbs. After two months, she presented dyspnea on minimal exertion and dysphonia. Spirometry revealed severe restrictive disorder and daily bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) machine was indicated.\\nThere was a progressive worsening of motor paresis in the lower limbs; aquileus reflexes were abolished, patellar abolished on the right and diminished on the left; paresis of upper limbs; biceps and tricipital hyperreflexia on the left; superficial and deep sensitivity preserved. She also had a loss of strength in the trunk and bilateral Hoffman sign.\\nShe presented respiratory insufficiency, even after new pulse therapy with methylprednisolone for five days, being intubated, requiring continuous mechanical ventilatory assistance. The disease course was thus clinically progressive and worsening, and five plasmapheresis sessions were performed, without clinical improvement. New ENMG revealed a pattern consistent with diffuse axonal motor neuropathy with no fasciculations and no conduction block, without bulbar involvement, without dysphagia. She presented joint pain with joint edema and hypotrophy, flaccidity, osteotendinous hyperreflexia. In this phase, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for arboviruses was negative in CSF and synovial fluid of the knees, but IgG for CHK was elevated in the CSF. Serology for Zika virus was negative. She presented signs of arthritis in the hands, in agreement with arbovirus, and was treated with chloroquine. After 188 days of hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient suffered respiratory complications, leading to death.", "age": "[[31.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26918158': 1, '24967777': 1, '27664983': 1, '25976325': 1, '27326363': 1, '15450778': 1, '29743772': 2, '33914880': 1, '11571323': 1, '16236322': 1, '24842949': 1, '11571341': 1, '28440098': 1, '23707220': 1, '31763099': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5930537-1': 1, '5930537-2': 1}"}
