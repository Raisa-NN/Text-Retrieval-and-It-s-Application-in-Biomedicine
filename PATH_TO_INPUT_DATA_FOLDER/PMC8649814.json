They engage in oral sex (performs only) and anal sex (receptive only) with partners who have external genitals. They report injection drug use and no sex work. They were last tested between 3 and 6 months ago and have had new partners since. According to current guidelines, trans-males are disproportionately affected by STIs/HIV and warrant comprehensive testing. Based on the identified risk practices, this person should receive gonorrhea and chlamydia testing (oral and rectal), syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C serology, and an HIV rapid test. The algorithm identified such testing appropriately.
