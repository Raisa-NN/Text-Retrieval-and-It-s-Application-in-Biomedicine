During the final cycle of chemotherapy, she developed neutropenia and fever, which were non-responsive to antibacterial therapy,\\nThe patient underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT scan to determine the cause of persistent fever. PET/CT scan was acquired 60 min after the intravenous injection of 217.02 MBq of 18F-FDG (3.5 MBq/kg) on Discovery 690 tomograph (General Electric Company, Milwaukee, WI, USA; 64-slice CT scan, 80 mA, 120 kV; 2.5 min/bed; 256\u00d7256 matrix, 60 cm field of view).\\nThe patient\u2019s glucose level was estimated at 94 mg/dL. 18F-FDG PET/CT scan showed multiple foci of intense FDG uptake in the liver; the largest uptake was reported in segment VI and the spleen (). No other pathological uptakes were discovered in the rest of the body, particularly lymphatic tissues. The subsequent abdominal CT scan confirmed the presence of multiple hypodense hepatic and splenic lesions, resembling microabscesses ().\\nHepatic biopsy of the largest lesion showed a chronic inflammatory process, similar to granuloma, with yeasts suggestive of hepatosplenic candidiasis (). The patient was treated with antifungal therapy, using fluconazole. After 30 days, the fever disappeared and the subsequent abdominal CT scan yielded negative results.", "age": "[[47.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8600000': 1, '28484350': 1, '3276268': 1, '27799331': 1, '22360318': 1, '20636432': 1, '31334700': 1, '24787634': 1, '15755501': 1, '1867239': 1, '33884224': 2, '32337632': 1, '19191635': 1, '20631500': 1, '19542950': 1, '10987117': 1, '17251526': 1, '32953250': 1, '24951213': 1, '27408899': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8054485-1': 1}"}
