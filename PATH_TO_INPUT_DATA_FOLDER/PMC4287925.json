Physical examination was remarkable for a blood pressure of 83/48, and black stool on rectal examination. Endoscopy demonstrated a 4-cm submucosal mass in the distal body of the stomach. The mass had central ulceration and a visible vessel, not actively bleeding. The presumptive diagnosis was GIST. CT demonstrated a 2.5 \u00d7 1.9 cm well-circumscribed, partially exophytic, arterially enhancing lesion. She underwent wedge resection of the greater curvature. She was discharged home on postoperative day 3 without complication. Pathology found a lobulated tumor composed of glomus cells in the submucosa and muscularis propria. The cells were positive for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, caldesmon and vimentin. There was focal positivity for synaptophysin and CD34. These are consistent with a GT.\\nA 70\u2013year-old male presented with light headedness, shortness of breath and 2 days of bright red blood per rectum progressing to melena. His hemoglobin was 92 g/l, a decrease from 144 g/l 10 days prior. Upper endoscopy demonstrated a 3-mm polyp in the duodenal cap (biopsy would be reported as a completely excised carcinoid tumor). Colonoscopy demonstrated a bleeding, edematous region in the ascending colon. Biopsy was non-diagnostic. CT demonstrated a 2.3 \u00d7 1.6 cm ascending colon lesion with hyperenhancement in the arterial phase and persistent enhancement in the portal venous and delayed phases. On octreotide scan, the lesion had intense uptake, consistent with a carcinoid. The clinical picture was in keeping with two synchronous primary carcinoid tumors. Laparoscopic converted to open right hemicolectomy was performed without complication. Final pathology demonstrated a GT with negative margins, 26 negative lymph nodes, 1 mitosis per 50 hpf, no vascular invasion and absence of necrosis. Follow-up for the colonic GT will include a colonoscopy and abdominal CT 1 year following surgery, as well as chromogranin A level every 6 months. Chromogranin A was mildly elevated preoperatively. For his duodenum, he will be followed with Esophagogastroduodenoscopy +/\u2212 endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) every 3\u20136 months initially.", "age": "[[88.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16940885': 1, '20204127': 2, '33223817': 1, '11859201': 1, '12768637': 1, '25935733': 1, '22507517': 1, '30407338': 1, '23286261': 1, '29161800': 1, '32116424': 2, '19758389': 1, '3037357': 1, '20582520': 1, '21424195': 1, '25576168': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2831458-1': 1, '7039828-1': 1}"}
