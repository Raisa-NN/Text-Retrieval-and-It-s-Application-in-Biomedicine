Right-arm clumsiness and gait disturbances followed 2 years later. Levodopa and dopamine agonists were given, with good motor responses; however, motor fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesia developed 5 years after starting the medications. Depression and anxiety were also noted. Brain MRIs showed no structural change and the MMSE score was 28 out of 30 while she was 36 years old. A genetic analysis with a targeted NGS panel identified a homozygous c.991G > T (p.D331Y) mutation in PLA2G6. The clinical details were described previously []. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of National Taiwan University Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants.", "age": "[[34.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26196026': 1, '21520282': 1, '30302010': 1, '19087156': 1, '30120687': 1, '27079681': 1, '22406380': 1, '30868093': 1, '31196701': 1, '31371146': 1, '28094106': 1, '25634434': 1, '20886109': 1, '21480372': 1, '25660576': 1, '18570303': 1, '30088174': 1, '34295884': 1, '34307755': 1, '25601130': 1, '22213678': 1, '24182522': 1, '34208795': 1, '34168672': 1, '30340910': 1, '29454663': 1, '27127721': 1, '28295203': 1, '30619057': 1, '20938027': 1, '28549837': 1, '27942883': 1, '33292730': 1, '21700586': 1, '23192926': 1, '27268037': 1, '29574084': 1, '23182313': 1, '29325618': 1, '32183746': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7076921-1': 2, '7076921-2': 2}"}
