He had previously been diagnosed with PH1 at another hospital, where he had undergone molecular genetic testing that confirmed the mutations of the AGXT gene at the following sites: c.346G>A(p.Gly116Arg), c.823_824dupAC(p.Ser275ArgfsX38). His plasma oxalate level was 24 \u03bcmol/L, and the results of imaging tests showed calculi in both the kidneys. His older brother had died years earlier because of kidney failure, the suspected cause of which was PH1. The patient's oxalate level reduction was partially responsive to pyridoxine therapy. Oxalosis was not detected outside 2 kidneys, defined less severe despite high plasma oxalate level. His liver function was unremarkable and liver anatomy was normal.\\nBased on the higher risk associated with whole liver replacement and the potential for a novel therapeutic breakthrough, we decided to perform APOLT rather than whole liver replacement. In China, not all people opt for organ donation after cardiac or brain death and live donation holds an advantage over deceased donation in terms of graft quality. The patient weighed 65 kg, which was similar to his mother's weight of 63 kg. The patient provided written, informed consent, and the operation was approved by the hospital's organ transplantation ethics committee. On confirmation of ABO compatibility, the patient's mother donated her left liver and right kidney. We used an in situ splitting technique to harvest the left liver (weight 450 g) without the middle hepatic vein and to harvest the right kidney. The donor's operation was uneventful, total blood loss was about 300 mL, and the course of her recovery was excellent.\\nThe recipient underwent left lateral sectionectomy of his native liver, followed by implantation of the donor's graft. The donor's left hepatic vein was anastomosed with the recipient's inferior vena cava; the recipient's left portal vein and left hepatic artery were connected to the donor's corresponding sites, hepaticohepaticostomy with a T tube was conducted for biliary reconstruction. The weight of the excised left lateral section was 430 g. When implantation of the liver graft was completed, the diseased right kidney was removed and the donor kidney was orthotopically transplanted; the ureteroureterostomy was performed and a double-J stent was placed in the ureter where it remained for 2 months. Total blood loss from the procedure was estimated to be about 400 mL.\\nThe patient's immunosuppressive regimen included an induction dose of basiliximab and maintenance therapy consisting of the following: prednisone (1 mg/kg, tapered by 10 mg each week down to 10 mg and discontinued after 3 months); mycophenolate mofetil (1 g orally twice a day, discontinued after 6 months); and tacrolimus (0.025 mg/kg, started on day 4 posttransplantation, and maintained at a trough level of 8\u201312 ng/mL for 3 months followed by a trough level of 5\u20137 ng/mL). Hyperhydration, pyridoxine, magnesium, and potassium citrate were also administered.\\nThe partial liver and renal grafts functioned well following transplantation (Table ). Volumetric analysis of the graft was performed by computerized tomography at 3 time points: 1 week before transplantation; 55 days and 15 months after transplant. The graft to whole liver volume ratios were 18.1%, 16.9%, and 17.9%, respectively, and the graft was small relative to the entire liver (Figure A and B).", "age": "[[21.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25403990': 1, '16850020': 1, '12682898': 1, '15707411': 1, '2887776': 1, '19479957': 1, '16082341': 1, '33691640': 2, '20002463': 1, '23526660': 1, '21866092': 1, '20849551': 1, '23915277': 1, '18261616': 1, '14526402': 1, '24330139': 1, '16162219': 1, '26252291': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7945658-1': 1}"}
