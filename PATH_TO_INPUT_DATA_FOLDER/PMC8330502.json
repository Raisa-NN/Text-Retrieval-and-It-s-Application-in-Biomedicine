Reportedly, the patient did not experience loss of consciousness, seizures, or focal weakness. His past medical history was most significant for anxiety, depression, and polysubstance abuse. Two days prior to the ED arrival, the patient took a bag of cocaine and six tablets of alprazolam. In the ED, his vital signs were unremarkable. On physical examination, profound motor weakness in all four extremities was noted (power: 1/5). Sensory examination and deep tendon reflexes were normal. The patient was awake and alert. On electrocardiogram (ECG), he was noted to have widespread ST depressions and U waves (Figure ).\\nIn his labs, he was noted to have a potassium level of 1.3 mEq/L, magnesium 2.7 mg/dL, bicarbonate 15 mEq/L, creatine kinase 911 U/L, blood urea nitrogen 16 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.27 mg/dL. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cervical spine were unremarkable. The serum drug screen was also unremarkable. The urine drug screen was positive for benzodiazepines and cocaine. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit for aggressive potassium and magnesium repletion and frequent electrolyte monitoring. Additional laboratory investigations were requested. Thyroid-stimulating hormone and cortisol levels were normal. The plasma renin-to-aldosterone ratio was slightly below normal. A spot urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio was not suggestive of urinary potassium wasting. After aggressive electrolyte repletion, the potassium started to improve (2.4 to 2.7 to 3.0). He initially got 60 mEq of potassium chloride in the emergency department. Later, in the intensive care unit, he was given additional doses of 40 mEq based on the repeated basic metabolic profile checks. His motor strength gradually improved. By day three of the hospitalization, no motor weakness was observed. The patient was discharged from the hospital and asked to have a close follow-up with his primary care physician. Unfortunately, the patient did not follow up with any healthcare providers after discharge.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20573078': 1, '26056834': 1, '29540487': 1, '9431493': 1, '28961544': 1, '24724752': 1, '18552739': 1, '8388847': 1, '1743698': 1, '11054760': 1, '17584063': 1, '22901631': 1, '12082066': 1, '34367754': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
