The rest of the clinical examination was unremarkable, apart from a slight overweight. A small protuberance was palpated at the medial proximal metaphysis of her right tibia.\\nConventional anteroposterior radiographs of knees in upstanding position showed a \u201cbeak-like\u201d protuberance of the medial tibial plateau of the right side (, white arrow) and a subtle abnormality of the corresponding region of the other side (, black arrow).\\nProton density-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on coronal plane () showed an abnormal osteochondral maturation of the proximal medial tibial plateau and the adjacent metaphysis. Epiphyseal and metaphyseal cartilage last unossified and distorted. Islands of anarchic bone ossification (, white arrow) corresponds to the \u201cbeak-like appearance\u201d visible on the radiograph. The growth plate appeared normal on MRI except for its medial third on the medial tibial plateau, which was slightly concave and thinned. Medial femoro-tibial joint space was enlarged (, black arrowhead). The interposed medial meniscus seemed thickened and globally of high signal with no visible lesion.", "age": "[[7.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'29481866': 1, '34622139': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
