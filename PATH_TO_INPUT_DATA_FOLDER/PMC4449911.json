The patient denied any symptoms, including dysphagia, facial weakness, or otalgia. A prior fine-needle aspiration of the mass was nondiagnostic. Past medical history was notable for hypertension and prostatic carcinoma treated with brachytherapy. He used alcohol daily and was a former smoker. On examination, a 3.5 cm mobile mass in the tail of the parotid was identified. Facial nerve function was intact and symmetric.\\nComputed tomography (CT) of the neck revealed a well-circumscribed, solid, isodense 4 \u00d7 3.5 cm mass, with no invasion into adjacent structures (). The mass contained a rim of peripheral calcification with no internal calcifications. No lymphadenopathy was observed in the remaining neck.\\nThe patient underwent right parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation. Grossly, the specimen contained a 4 \u00d7 3.5 cm well-circumscribed, tan-white, firm, and focally cystic mass containing yellow-green gelatinous material, a thick fibrous capsule, and significant calcifications. After decalcification, histopathology revealed elements of salivary acini, a stroma of variable chondroid and myxoid composition, and ossification of the periphery (). Final pathological diagnosis was carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CXPA), noninvasive with extensive ossification. The patient did well postoperatively with no new complaints and remained symptom-free nine months later.", "age": "[[76.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21744105': 1, '11505478': 1, '32127904': 1, '28658924': 1, '11844056': 1, '18272554': 1, '17991056': 1, '1311743': 1, '1851189': 1, '18439465': 1, '26075129': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
