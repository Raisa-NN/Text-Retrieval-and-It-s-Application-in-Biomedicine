At first, we planned EVT for diffuse stenosis of the right SFA. We introduced a 6-Fr sheath via the ipsilateral common femoral artery. Angiographically, there was no severe calcification, and the lesion length was approximately 160 mm (). Preoperative intravascular ultrasound revealed a fibrous plaque without severe calcification at the lesion site (). We performed balloon angioplasty using a 3.0/200-mm balloon, followed by angioplasty using two 4.0/150-mm PCBs (IN.PACT\u2122 Admiral\u2122). Final angiography showed some dissection, although there was no remarkable residual stenosis (). After 42 days, we performed EVT for the left SFA along with follow-up angiography and OFDI (Lunawave; Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for the right SFA. Although dissection was still observed in follow-up angiography, there was no restenosis at the treated site (). Follow-up OFDI demonstrated several high-intensity regions with attenuation on the lumen surface (\u2013()). High-power field images showed the high-intensity regions more clearly. There was no apparent neointimal hyperplasia over these regions (\u2013()).", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17537765': 1, '25459307': 1, '26117470': 1, '26476467': 1, '28902718': 1, '27033233': 1, '32110413': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
