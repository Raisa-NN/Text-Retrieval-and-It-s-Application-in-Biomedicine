He also wanted a least invasive, cost-effective treatment to enhance his esthetics. From the appearance of his teeth, diagnosis of moderate flourosis staining was determined by Dean's Fluorosis Index (). The most significant staining occurring on the maxillary anterior teeth contained dark brown streaks in the middle third of the facial surfaces (). The same procedure for the microabrasion was repeated as was done in . After the procedure was completed, fluoride gel application was placed on the teeth to reduce the postoperative sensitivity. The rubber dam was removed for the evaluation of the result by the patient (). The patient was quite satisfied with the results. In the above mentioned cases, patients were asked not to smoke, eat, or drink anything that could possibly stain the teeth for 24\u201348 hours after the treatment.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'3507717': 1, '32009734': 1, '2756095': 1, '6589292': 1, '17542197': 1, '14586302': 1, '32149058': 1, '17374110': 1, '3457401': 1, '15719920': 1, '24222868': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3816034-1': 2}"}
