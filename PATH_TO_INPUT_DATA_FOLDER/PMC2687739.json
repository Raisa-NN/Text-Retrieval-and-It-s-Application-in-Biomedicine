He was admitted to the Pediatric Department of Yongdong Severance hospital after a 2-week history of cough, rhinorrhea, poor appetite, and deterioration of his general health condition. On arrival, the patient's temperature was 36.5\u2103 (97.7\u2109), respirations were 32 breaths/min, pulse was 130 beats/min, and blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg (50-75th percentile for his age). On physical examination, he appeared to be moderately ill. There was a moderate degree of inspiratory stridor but normal oxygen saturation was noted. Inspection of the oral cavity showed a huge, left peritonsillar swelling.\\nLaboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 11,950 (42% neutrophils, 42% lymphocytes, 10% monocytes, and 4% eosinophils) and normal electrolytes. The C-reactive protein (CRP) level was elevated, at 9.2 mg/L.\\nOn the day of admission, an urgent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck was performed showing a large PTA on the left side that measured 2.7\u00d72.4\u00d71.7 cm (). Treatment with intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam and gentamicin was initiated. On Day 3 of hospitalization, the patient was eating normally, and there was no inspiratory stridor on physical examination. A follow-up CT scan of the neck was performed after five days of intravenous antibiotic therapy. The previously-noted left peritonsillar lower attenuation density with peripheral rim enhancement had markedly decreased ().\\nOn Day 6 of hospitalization, the patient's general condition had normalized and he was discharged with a prescription for oral cefnidir for 12 days. A follow-up intraoral examination two weeks later showed a well-resolved infection, normal mucosa, and no recurrence of the abscess.", "age": "[[40.0, 'day']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'8745790': 1, '8463886': 1, '10819113': 1, '1285560': 1, '8024219': 1, '11223453': 1, '10419038': 1, '11804446': 1, '10731920': 1, '7630308': 1, '16941748': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
