Her pain was localized to the V2 distribution on the right and became unbearable even though she was on pregabalin, carbamazepine and amitriptyline. Her imaging studies showed a compression at the right trigeminal root by the superior cerebellar artery.\\nDuring preoperative planning with the 360\u00b0VR model of the patient's CTA, a 13mm burr hole was made precisely at the junction of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses by drilling inside the skull outward (Video 2). With the patient anesthetized in a lateral position, the saved 360\u00b0XR template was projected as an AR overlay onto the patient's anatomy. The template burr hole was marked onto the patient's skin and used to guide incision placement. The overlay was used again to guide the bone opening. The template burr hole was duplicated in surgery, with the same size and placement as the one made in VR. The rest of the surgery proceeded in standard fashion. No restriction of movement was encountered because of the size of the opening.\\nThe patient experienced pain relief immediately after surgery. At 3 mo, she had stopped taking amitriptyline and was actively weaning off the others without experiencing pain.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'24594927': 1, '32561486': 1, '29040677': 1, '28637947': 1, '27521727': 1, '28233166': 1, '33316813': 1, '27177182': 1, '31103764': 1, '31741810': 1, '18240940': 1, '27609450': 1, '23254813': 1, '29994003': 1, '30579049': 1, '25037466': 1, '34171909': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8453400-1': 2}"}
