Laboratory findings revealed his serum alpha-fetoprotein was mildly elevated at 21, 312 ng/mL, and his hepatitis B serology was positive. Serum liver function tests were within the normal limits except for the slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase (250 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (210 U/L). Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a destructive lesion that showed enhancement during the hepatic arterial phase (Fig. ) and rapid washout during the portal venous phase (Fig. ) in the left liver lobe, which was most likely consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\\nHowever, the patient has subsequently performed a laparoscopic left hepatectomy and his pathology examination indicated the specimen was poorly differentiated and displayed two distinct components: one with HCC-like feature and the other with cholangiocarcinoma (CC) pattern (Fig. ). Further immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of combined hepatocellular carcinoma\u2013cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC). The postoperative course was without severe complications and the patient was discharged 15 days after surgery. During the subsequent follow-up for 1 year since surgery, the patient remains well without any signs of recurrence (Fig. ).", "age": "[[62.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16998683': 1, '22451237': 1, '29360137': 1, '34124392': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
