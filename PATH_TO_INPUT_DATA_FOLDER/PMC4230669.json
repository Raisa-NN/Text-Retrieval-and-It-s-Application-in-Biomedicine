Two months ago she progressively developed an erythematous,\\ncrusted and erosive plaque with infiltrated edges, measuring 2.5 cm in diameter in the\\ndistal extensor region of left arm ().\\nDirect investigation (imprint) detected amastigote structures\\ncompatible with Leishmania sp. Histopathological examination revealed\\nepidermis with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, dermis with a dense inflammatory\\ninfiltrate constituted of lymphocytes, plasmocytes, macrophages and some multinucleated\\ngiant cells. Macrophages containing corpuscles with characteristics of amastigote forms\\nof Leishmania () were\\nobserved. She received N-methylglucamine (NMG) (5.3ml/day for 20 days) with discreet\\nlesion regression. As she showed no improvement 2 months after the end of the NMG\\ntreatment, liposomal amphotericin B was initiated (total dose of 575mg). Thirty days\\nafter the treatment active lesions still persisted. Suspecting that the\\nLeishmania was acquired in the Amazon region, we began using\\npentamidine, prescribing 7mg/kg IM in a single dose. The patient presented regression of\\nthe lesion and a cicatricial plaque remained ().", "age": "[[6.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21437523': 1, '22281895': 1, '33759923': 2, '19503979': 1, '29869609': 1, '34232908': 1, '22147024': 1, '29624582': 1, '33432903': 1, '12453009': 1, '25387505': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8008861-1': 1, '8008861-2': 1}"}
