The patient was recruited into the research project described above through a chromosomal disorders patient organization (Association Valentin, Eragny sur Oise, France). He and his wife, a healthy 36-year-old woman, had four miscarriages most likely related to an unbalanced transmission of the paternal translocation, although no genetic evaluation was conducted at the time. He was not considered to be infertile, since the couple had not had trouble obtaining pregnancies. This was confirmed by normal semen parameters on several occasions. The proportion of unbalanced spermatozoa was 63.6% before DGC and 52.3% after DGC. The couple was therefore offered intrauterine insemination, preceded by a DGC-based sperm preparation.\\nPregnancy was obtained after the second insemination. Considering the large size of the translocated chromosomal segments, we estimated that an unbalanced karyotype in the fetus would lead to rather severe malformations, detectable by ultrasound examination. These were normal throughout the pregnancy and prenatal genetic diagnosis was postponed until 32 weeks in order to minimize the risk of miscarriage. It revealed a balanced female karyotype carrying the paternal translocation. Birth occurred at week 39 and was uncomplicated.", "age": "[[37.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16484311': 1, '21871621': 1, '23288665': 1, '16192706': 1, '24885495': 1, '23633550': 1, '32359369': 1, '24587925': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
