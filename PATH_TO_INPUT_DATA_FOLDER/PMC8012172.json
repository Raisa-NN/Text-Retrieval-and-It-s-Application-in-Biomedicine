The incident occurred two years before disclosure, and the abuse occurred within the victim\u2019s home.\\nUpon presentation to the PRHJC, this victim was exhibiting a multitude of psychiatrically concerning behaviors that began shortly following the abuse. Within the school setting the child had experienced significant academic decline, including failing one class, and in the year prior to presentation was no longer participating in previously enjoyed extra-curricular activities. At home, the child was noted to have poor sleep secondary to frequent nighttime awakening and excessive daytime fatigue. The victim\u2019s mother reported that on multiple occasions, the child would become easily upset, leading her to lock herself in her room and isolate. During several of these instances, the victim had expressed wanting to take her own life.\\nAgain, the child experienced multiple worrisome behaviors leading to episodes of suicidal thoughts, yet no psychiatric services were received. It is notable that before presentation at the PRHJC the child had received a psychological evaluation due to her abrupt decline in academic performance; however, the warning signs of child sexual abuse continued unidentified, symptoms persisted, and appropriate care was not provided.", "age": "[[17.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11015813': 1, '14602100': 1, '31692417': 1, '15567021': 1, '29075426': 1, '31519507': 1, '32045342': 1, '31180815': 1, '33824797': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8012172-1': 2, '8012172-2': 2}"}
