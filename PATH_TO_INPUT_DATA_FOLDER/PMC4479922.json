The USG abdomen demonstrated normal sized and normally positioned left kidney while right kidney was not localized in the abdomen/pelvic region. Blood urea profile (26 mg/dL) and serum creatinine (0.8 mg/dL) were within normal limits. Renal dynamic scintigraphy was performed in posterior view under the gamma camera after intravenous administration of 2 mCiof Tc99m-EC along with 10 mg frusemide. From the initial frame onward, tracer activity was localized in both renal fossae, more intense in the renal left fossa. The activity in both renal fossae appeared to decrease with time and 3-h and 5-h delayed images showed faint tracer activity in bilateral renal fossae [Figure \u2013]. The scintigraphic study was interpreted as normal functioning left kidney with unobstructed drainage and impaired functioning enlarged right kidney. The single-photon emission computerized tomography/computerized tomography (SPECT/CT) abdominal imaging [Figure \u2013] was performed because of the nonvisualization of right kidney on USG; localized this tracer activity in the enlarged right lobe of liver.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12624122': 1, '9170451': 1, '8176468': 1, '16953906': 1, '9061700': 1, '1532419': 1, '10774890': 1, '30713384': 2, '8223766': 1, '24019659': 1, '31258277': 2, '26170576': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6352639-1': 1, '6568147-1': 1}"}
