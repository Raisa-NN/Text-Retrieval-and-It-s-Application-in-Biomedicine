He was admitted to the local hospitals A&E Department. Upon admission his pulse rate was 144/min, blood pressure 105/52 mmHg, and GCS 5/15. He was intubated ventilated, and subsequently trauma series X-rays and CT scans were performed.\\nClinical findings of note were an abrasion to his lower anterior abdominal wall and bluish discoloration of his abdomen. The only positive radiological finding of note was the presence of free fluid in his abdomen on the abdominal CT scan.\\nHe underwent an emergency laparotomy because of persistent hypotension despite resuscitation. At laparotomy, his spleen was in three pieces and completely avulsed off its pedicle. There was a 30 cm long tear in the small bowel mesentery with the related gut showing signs of ischaemia. The rest of his bowel and solid organs were normal. He underwent splenectomy and resection of small bowel and end-to-end anastomosis. He made an uneventful recovery except for an incisional hernia that has been repaired successfully. Subsequent review of his CT scans revealed subtle features of nonenhancement of the spleen compared to the liver in the portal venous phase suggestive of splenic pedicle injury. There was active extravasation of contrast around the splenic hilum suggestive of ongoing active bleeding (Figures and ).", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'4011912': 1, '7302229': 1, '17293574': 1, '2681805': 1, '7976900': 1, '8203971': 1, '21209813': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3014821-1': 2}"}
