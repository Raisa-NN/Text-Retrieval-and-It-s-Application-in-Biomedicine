Clinical examination showed a dextroposed heart with no other significant cardiac findings. The chest radiograph revealed dextroposition, an abnormal scimitar shadow along the right heart border without cardiomegaly []. Right heart chambers were mildly dilated, and an abnormal pulmonary vein was draining into the inferior caval vein with mild turbulence []. There were no associated intracardiac anomalies. Catheter hemodynamics showed a shunt ratio of 1.11:1, pulmonary artery pressures were 25/6 (mean 16) mmHg, and indexed pulmonary vascular resistance was 1.6 Wood units. An abdominal aortic large collateral with systemic pressures (75/45, mean 68 mmHg) perfused the lower lobe of the right lung, and venous phase demonstrated the double-arched scimitar vein to inferior vena cava []. This was closed with multiple coils []. Right pulmonary arteriogram showed dual drainage of the right lung both to left atrium and to inferior vena cava with a connecting vein between the two draining veins [ and ]. The scimitar vein was accessed from femoral venous catheter and closed at the vena caval junction using multiple coils, which rerouted the venous drainage of the right lung to the left atrium [ and ]. On low-dose aspirin, she remained free of the wheezy respiratory illnesses with normal size of cardiac chambers on echocardiography at 1-year follow-up.", "age": "[[2.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26374351': 1, '17126429': 1, '25384927': 1, '8498375': 1, '21294932': 1, '24239152': 1, '7758551': 1, '5078012': 1, '9676809': 1, '25341362': 1, '33311925': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
