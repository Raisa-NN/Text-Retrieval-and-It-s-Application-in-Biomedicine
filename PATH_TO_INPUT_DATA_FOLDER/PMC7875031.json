The laboratory tests were within normal limits. A radiography of the hips and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at another institution, which were initially interpreted as a fracture of the right ischiopubic ramus.\\nBone scintigraphy with a fusion of tomographic images (single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography [SPECT/CT]) was requested. Focal increased uptake at the site of ischiopubic synchondrosis was documented, and a fracture was ruled out. It correlated with the aforementioned extra-institutional images, in which a prominence and focal expansion of the middle portion of the right ischiopubic ramus corresponding to the synchondrosis was identified, associated with an increase in signal intensity in sequences with T2 information with fat saturation due to bone and adjacent soft-tissue edema. Findings represent a stress-related lesion at the level of ischiopubic synchondrosis, diagnostic of ischiopubic osteochondritis, which is also called Van Neck\u2013Odelberg disease.", "age": "[[15.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'13313248': 1, '21654459': 1, '7254921': 1, '14736662': 1, '10913713': 1, '11601821': 1, '24096590': 1, '33623518': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
