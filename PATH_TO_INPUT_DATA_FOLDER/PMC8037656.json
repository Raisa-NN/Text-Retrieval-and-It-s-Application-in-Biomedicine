The attacks mainly involved the face, arms, and left leg, and were sometimes associated with mild itching. They occurred approximately weekly and showed a good response to high doses of oral glucocorticoids. The edema lasted approximately 3\u20134 days if not treated. The patient\u2019s past and family medical history were negative for AE episodes, allergic disorders, autoimmune diseases, and other common eosinophilic diseases. She reported that, in the previous six months, laboratory investigations had shown a recurrent increase of total leukocyte count (up to 23,400/mm3 during the acute phase), eosinophil levels (9617/mm3; 41%), and neutrophil count (9009/mm3; 38.50%). Hemoglobin and platelet counts had always been normal. The patient had already undergone several investigations, including blood chemistry, serum protein electrophoresis, immunological tests for connective tissue diseases, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urine analysis, parasitology, and chest X-ray, which were all within normal limits. An abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly and two concomitant small hepatic cysts (1 cm) and splenomegaly (splenic length 140 mm).\\nWhen the patient was referred to our care, unilateral periorbital edema of the face was evident on physical examination, her body temperature and other vital signs were within normal limits, and her body mass index (BMI) was 31.9 kg/m2. We repeated laboratory investigations that revealed a total leukocyte count of 17,200/mm3 with 45.5% of eosinophils (7830/mm3). Hemoglobin, neutrophil, and platelet counts were normal.\\nBecause the patient had a history of rhinitis and chronic sinusitis, we assessed total IgE and specific IgE for most common grass and tree pollens, dust mites, animal dander, and molds, which were either in the normal range or were negative. A maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan showed unilateral maxillary sinusitis ().\\nOther tests such as C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), ANCA-MPO, PR3-ANCA, DSDNA-Ab, IgG, IgA, IgM, anti-transglutaminase IgA, C3, C4, C1-INH, C1Q, and tryptase levels were within normal limits. Tumor marker levels (AFP, CEA, CA 19-9, CA 15-3, CA 125, \u03b22 microglobulin) were not increased. Multiple stool examinations and \u201cscotch tape\u201d tests were performed to detect parasites, resulting negative. IgE for Echinococcus was not found. Blood cell immunophenotyping identified: CD3, 83%; CD4, 54%; CD8, 14%; CD19, 7%; CD56, 7%; CD3+CD56+, 2%; CD25+CD3+, 1%; TCR\u03b1\u03b2, 69%; CD3+CD4-CD8-TCR\u03b1\u03b2+, 0.9%; and CD4%/CD8%, 3.86%.\\nNo morphological abnormalities were detected on peripheral blood smear examination. Because the patient also complained of pyrosis and epigastric pain, she underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy () plus random biopsies, which revealed mild esophagitis with no eosinophilic infiltrate.\\nSpirometry and echocardiography were normal, whereas a CT scan of the chest detected subcentimetric anterior mediastinal lymph nodes and axillary lymphadenopathy (maximum diameter 1.3 cm). Multiple small reactive lymphadenopathies were also detected at ultrasound examination of the cervical and inguinal regions and at the Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) total body scan (), which also revealed a mild and homogenously diffuse 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) bone marrow uptake.\\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed to rule out any associated malignancy, which showed only an increase in eosinophilic precursors and mild T cell (CD5+, CD20-) infiltrate, but no atypical cells.\\nGenetic tests for mutations, including BCR/ABL and FIP1L1-PDGFRA, performed on both peripheral blood and bone marrow cells, were negative.\\nAccording to clinical criteria, the patient was diagnosed with EAE and she was treated with high doses of oral glucocorticoids (Prednisone 75 mg/day for two weeks) with symptoms resolution and normalization of eosinophil counts. Subsequently, an oral prednisone tapering was scheduled up to the current maintenance dose of 5 mg/day. At the last follow-up (12 months from the EAE diagnosis), the patient has achieved clinical and biological remission.\\nThe clinical characteristics of the patient are summarized in .", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28112388': 1, '32344186': 1, '26648083': 1, '19243381': 1, '22502795': 1, '1884020': 1, '14565669': 1, '17868863': 1, '16750989': 1, '29896203': 1, '28954105': 1, '18061102': 1, '6727934': 1, '18320923': 1, '12920441': 1, '29393169': 1, '22460074': 1, '18973106': 1, '26209897': 1, '17166416': 1, '9641577': 1, '26233430': 1, '1732010': 1, '24553977': 1, '2208795': 1, '30738125': 1, '1633350': 1, '28432171': 1, '19577011': 1, '25527564': 1, '10886202': 1, '17427070': 1, '11306981': 1, '26469206': 1, '32557651': 1, '24991461': 1, '28514601': 1, '19264686': 1, '17703383': 1, '11167701': 1, '31725177': 1, '8813097': 1, '11359025': 1, '33916211': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
