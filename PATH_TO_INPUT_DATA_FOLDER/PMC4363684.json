She had no symptoms of dysmenorrhoea or cyclical umbilical pain. At physical examination, she had a soft, painful swelling with a diameter of 2 cm in the umbilicus, which was irreducible by gentle digital pressure (Fig. ). Ultrasonography revealed a hypodense nodule of 1.8 cm at the umbilicus (Fig. ). However, a definitive diagnosis could not be established thus far. Under the provisional clinical diagnosis, \u2018irreducible umbilical hernia with probably strangulated fatty tissue in the hernia sac\u2019 surgical exploration of the umbilicus was performed. Under general anaesthesia, a sub-umbilical incision was made. To our surprise, a subcutaneous, lobulated mass was exposed, which was fixated on the bottom of the umbilicus (Fig. ). The abdominal wall itself was unaffected. The nodule was excised, and histopathological examination revealed connective tissue fragments with irregular tubular formations surrounded by stromal cells. Our patient was treated by excision of the swelling that turned out to be PUE. Two months after the surgery, she visited the outpatient clinic and reported complete recovery of the painful sensation and swelling in the umbilicus.", "age": "[[47.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'24291679': 1, '28966521': 2, '21793086': 1, '29723349': 1, '12738499': 1, '33343962': 1, '15541453': 1, '24331768': 1, '23271917': 1, '27747115': 2, '28645906': 1, '32595921': 2, '17218225': 1, '16498086': 1, '33078482': 1, '25786440': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5055931-1': 1, '7303103-1': 1, '5597658-1': 1}"}
