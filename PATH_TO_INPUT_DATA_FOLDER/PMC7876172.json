The recurrent HCCs were treated by repeat TACE in which, tumors in S5 and S8 were embolized through the celiac artery (Fig. ), and the patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 4 without any complications. However, on the following day, he was re-admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain and fever. Laboratory findings showed an increase in white blood cell count to 9.9 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl and serum C-reactive protein level to 19.91 mg/dl. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed intraperitoneal free air and dirty fat signs around the ascending colon (Fig. a, b). The patient was diagnosed with gastrointestinal perforation with peritonitis, and underwent emergency laparotomy. Upon surgical exploration of the abdomen, multiple ulcers and perforation were detected in the terminal ileum (Fig. a, b), for which intestinal resection and ileostomy were performed. Pathological examination revealed CCE of arterial vasculature of the small intestine that indicated ischemic perforation of the small intestine caused by CCE (Fig. ). After surgery, the patient developed superficial surgical site infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which was treated with systemic antibiotics. The patient recovered and was discharged on POD 30. He had no further recurrence of cholesterol crystal embolism or HCC as of 3 years after surgery.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27151477': 1, '20381857': 1, '18086636': 1, '17606842': 1, '17063989': 1, '12761259': 1, '14614975': 1, '11461954': 1, '17052483': 1, '3310742': 1, '12873565': 1, '15824965': 1, '33055480': 1, '16614719': 1, '14586747': 1, '32277287': 1, '33566211': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
