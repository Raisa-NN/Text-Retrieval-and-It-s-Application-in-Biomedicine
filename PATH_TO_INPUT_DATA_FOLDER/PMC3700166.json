Medical university, Lucknow, India with chief complaint of swelling over the right side of upper lip and cheek. At birth, he was in good condition but there was a large polypoid growth protruding from the right upper lip. The growth was obliterating right half of the oral cavity and right nasal aperture, pushing right ala upward. Lower lip was not involved. On examination, the lesion measured 6 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 cm. It was cystic, but contained ill-defined rubbery nodules []. Biopsy of lesion done under local anesthesia confirmed the diagnosis of teratoma. Soon after diagnosis, under general anesthesia, it was excised through a right transverse incision combined with massive dissection []. Layer wise suturing was done []. Microscopic examination revealed a cystic mass composed entirely of adult tissue from all three germ cell layers. The cystic cavities were lined by stratified squamous epithelium or pseuodstratified respiratory epithelium, and underlying the epithelium were groups of mucous glands, small islands of cartilage, brain tissue, and transitional epithelium. Smooth muscle fibers were scattered throughout.\\nThe child was discharged on the tenth postoperative day, having had an uneventful postoperative course. No further therapy was planned because the lesion was non-malignant. On a follow-up period of 24 months, the patient was found to be disease-free.", "age": "[[10.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'540545': 1, '712528': 1, '382080': 1, '6345230': 1, '12464901': 1, '30815217': 1, '3385592': 1, '4636146': 1, '6517466': 1, '687218': 1, '4070461': 1, '15213888': 1, '23833507': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
