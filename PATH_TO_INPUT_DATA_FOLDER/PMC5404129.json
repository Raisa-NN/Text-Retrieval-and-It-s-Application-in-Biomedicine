She underwent total hybrid McKeown resection of the esophagus (VATS with laparotomy and cervicotomy) with pharyngogastric anastomosis as well as microjejunostomy, pyloromyoplasty, the Kocher maneuver, and three-field lymphadenectomy. Stage IA (pT1aN0Mo) was confirmed by postoperative specimen examination. Tachycardia (100/min) was observed between the 4th and 7th postoperative day. Oral contrast X-ray examination revealed stenosis of the pylorus at the level of the hiatus (). The pylorus was compressed by the malpositioned colon. A decision was made to perform a reoperation, which included colon repositioning, hiatal plasty, and right hemicolectomy due to ischemia and necrosis. The postoperative period was complicated by peritonitis, which was successfully treated with peritoneal lavage.", "age": "[[34.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'10027372': 1, '24573659': 1, '19590816': 1, '15664372': 1, '21983843': 1, '20976482': 1, '22806074': 1, '18036896': 1, '22115216': 1, '19896389': 1, '28515750': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
