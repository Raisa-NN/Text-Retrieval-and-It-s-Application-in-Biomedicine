After an uneventful initial posttransplant period, he developed a painless unilateral swelling in the right tonsil 97 months after the transplantation. Excision biopsy was performed; tissue histology was suggestive of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Reduction of immunosuppression was in the form of reduction in the dose of cyclosporine from 3.5 to 3 mg/kg/day to reduce 2-h concentration (C2) levels from 555 to 232 ng/ml along with the reduction of dose of azathioprine from 1.5 to 1 mg/kg/day.
