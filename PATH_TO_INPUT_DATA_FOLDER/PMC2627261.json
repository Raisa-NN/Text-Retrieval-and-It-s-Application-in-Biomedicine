There was no past medial history of hepatolithiasis, recurrent peptic ulcer, abdominal operation, allergic disease, generalized skin eruption or food sensitivity. The laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell count of 12.86 \u00d7 103/\u00b5l. There was peripheral eosinophilia ranging from 7% to 52% (normal: 0-7.2%). The total IgE was 593 IU/ml (normal: 0-170 IU/ml). Stool examination and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test to detect parasite infestation showed negative results. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 40 mg/dl (normal: 10-26 mg/dl) and the serum creatine was 2.1 mg/dl (normal: 0.6-1.3 mg/dl). An ultrasound scan for evaluation of acute renal failure yielded negative results except for pneumobilia. Because of the absence of prior sphincterotomy, a surgical bypass procedure or recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), we inferred the existence of enterobiliary fistula. The acute renal failure was slightly improved and we then performed multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for further evaluation. MDCT revealed diffuse submucosal thickening from the antrum of the stomach to the duodenal bulb and a bezoar at the first portion of duodenum. But enterobiliary fistula was not clearly detected (). Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed large ulcers with a geographic pattern from the antrum of the stomach to the duodenal bulb (). The duodenum revealed severe stricture involving the second portion and a soft bezoar at the first portion of the duodenum. MRCP demonstrated that there was pneumobilia in the gall bladder and common bile duct (CBD). In addition, cholecystoduodenal fistula and a suspected choledocoduodenal fistula were observed (). The results of the UGI were similar to those of the MRCP, and the other findings were mucosal fold thickening and nodularity involving the antrum and severe stricture involving the second portion of the duodenum (). Biopsy samples were obtained at the ulcer bed, and they showed marked eosinophilic infiltration (). We adopted the criteria shown in for evaluating the tissue eosinophilia; severe eosinophilia (over 70 eosinophils/\u00d7 400 field) was demonstrated in the lamina propria of the gastric mucosa. The diagnosis was enterobiliary fistula complicating eosinophilic gastroenteritis. After steroid therapy, there was interval improvement of both the ulcer and duodenal luminal narrowing on the follow up endoscopy.", "age": "[[68.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12175271': 1, '3385550': 1, '27086704': 1, '5426746': 1, '2318432': 1, '2077646': 1, '10415254': 1, '8578348': 1, '12757181': 1, '6071536': 1, '7814459': 1, '18525231': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
