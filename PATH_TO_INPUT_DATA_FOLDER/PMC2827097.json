The pain was not observed elsewhere on the body nor was it correlated with other symptoms, such as fever, nausea or vomiting. In addition, the pain did not affect food intake or daily physical activity. Before medical consultation no systematic treatment had been applied for the pain, which was relieved after some minutes, only to relapse some days later.\\nHistory revealed an episode of reported angina 4 months prior to consultation, with non -specific ST/T abnormalities in the ECG. Physical examination revealed no important findings. The blood tests revealed no obvious pathology, with a normal hematocrit and blood coagulation parameters. Biochemical testing for hepatic and renal was also within normal values. Imaging included a chest radiography, which revealed no abnormalities and an abdominal CT scan with oral gastrografin intake, which revealed a 3 \u00d7 6 cm cystic formation located at the lower pole of the spleen (Figure ). Due to the lack of an infectious (no compatible clinical signs, no CRP or WBC count elevation, negative serological testing for Echinococcus) or traumatic background and the lack of evidence in favor of a cystic neoplasm (homologous content, normal perimeter, no increase in cancer-associated biochemical markers, such as Ca 19-9 and CEA), a latent congenital epithelial cyst was considered most probable. Four days later an MRI examination confirmed the previous result. The symptoms were not definitely associated to the cyst and the physician related them to the patient's increased stress, assuming she had irritable bowel syndrome.\\nEight years later (2005), the patient visited her physician, reporting a periodic continuation of the abdominal pain, whereas neither the character nor the frequency of episodes differed. At this point, she was referred to the Attikon University Hospital for surgical treatment. An abdominal CT scan was performed as part of the preoperative evaluation, revealing a 3 \u00d7 5 cm splenic cyst which confirmed the existence of this random finding (Figure ). The rest of the tests were within normal limits again. The patient decided to follow a conservative approach and re-evaluation at an annual basis. In November 2006, an ultrasound of the area revealed further regression of the cyst with a clear hyperechogenic perimeter, the size being estimated at less than 3 cm. For a more accurate description, an MRI scan was performed, which showed almost complete regression, with a remnant lesion of 1.8 \u00d7 1.4 cm and low T2 sign in the peripheral border (Figure ), consistent with the pattern observed in the 2005 MRI (a comparative presentation of original and subsequent lesion is provided). Her last MRI examination in 2008 revealed the cyst dimensions equal to the last two radiographic images and a periodically regression of her nonspecific symptomatology, which finally proved that the presence of the cyst was responsible for her previous symptoms.\\nSurprisingly, in our case, the cyst, although particularly large, was only reported to cause mild symptoms though were not definitely linked to the finding itself, which may imply that former empirical treatment rules may not be applicable in all such cases after all.", "age": "[[42.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16425403': 1, '17131049': 1, '12637814': 1, '16378327': 1, '15599294': 1, '11380971': 1, '24871081': 1, '11084135': 1, '17117313': 1, '1': 1, '17164514': 1, '15883503': 1, '34418805': 1, '11893134': 1, '24963908': 2, '30416137': 1, '11569516': 1, '15026897': 1, '16154823': 1, '11288000': 1, '12455798': 1, '12193826': 1, '14712105': 1, '11842957': 1, '20184691': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3813775-1': 1}"}
