After antidepressant medication was tapered off, ECT was delivered three times a week. Right unilateral (RUL) stimulation was administered using a Thymatron IV ECT apparatus (Somatics Inc., Lake Buff, IL, USA). During the first ECT, general anesthesia was carried out with thiopental; for muscle relaxation succinylcholine was given. During awakening prolonged apnea was observed for about 25 min and mask ventilation was required. Since BCHE deficiency was suspected, a dibucaine number test was carried out that showed an inhibition rate of 53% (normal range > 70%). A dose reduction of succinylcholine, switch to cisatracurium and prolonged mask ventilation allowed the continuation of ECT, which led to a full recovery (diagnosed on follow-up April 2011).", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12009429': 1, '11246075': 1, '13479831': 1, '17805000': 1, '20633755': 1, '15010399': 1, '17894110': 1, '21029050': 1, '22053728': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
