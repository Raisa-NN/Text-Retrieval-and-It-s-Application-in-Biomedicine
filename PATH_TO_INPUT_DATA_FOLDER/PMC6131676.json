After control of inflammation, barium esophagography was performed, and it showed a PSF on the left side. CT showed an air- and barium-containing fistula. MLS was performed as first-line treatment. The fistula was narrow, and its tissue was not fragile (Fig. ). Therefore, we made the incision as small as possible (Fig. , ), and the operation was completed uneventfully (Fig. ). Barium esophagography was performed on the fifth postoperative day, and no leakage was noted. Free oral intake was started on the same day. She had an uneventful recovery, and she was discharged 7 days after the surgery. No recurrence was observed during a 10-month follow-up.", "age": "[[10.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27240509': 1, '24357142': 1, '26392060': 1, '26820515': 1, '24434129': 1, '26527612': 1, '25748690': 1, '20007720': 1, '85992': 1, '32587683': 2, '24726124': 1, '20855681': 1, '19573674': 1, '9738814': 1, '22847863': 1, '9021563': 1, '22953130': 2, '22495884': 1, '18031833': 1, '23478017': 1, '19481267': 1, '12884218': 1, '30203269': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6131676-1': 2, '7304931-1': 1, '3420472-1': 1}"}
