After a thorough clinical examination and gathering of a medical history, she reported that her brother and mother suffered similar dental anomalies and for this reason the family members were given an appointment. At this appointment it was confirmed that her fifteen year-old brother had agenesis of both maxillar lateral incisors (both had been replaced with a removable prosthesis) and of the mandibular left canine (B). The mother of both was a 46-year-old woman who presented with pronounced lingualization of the mandibular left canine, persistence of the mandibular left second temporary molar (by agenesis of the second left premolar) and conoidism of the maxillar left lateral incisor (C).\\nAll families reported having supernumerary nipples: the women with one on either side of the mammary line, the male with two on the left side and one on the right (D). The individuals noted the absence of renal, neurological or other disorders or malformations other than those reported and were referred for medical follow-up. No other pathological condition was detected. The individuals reported the absence of dental anomalies or polythelia in other family members.", "age": "[[19.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20450310': 1, '17521013': 1, '11421419': 1, '16441639': 1, '22900446': 1, '12943430': 1, '18836948': 1, '7660204': 1, '29205145': 1, '18236823': 1, '22755319': 1, '9809822': 1, '22852527': 1, '19503990': 1, '24970959': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
