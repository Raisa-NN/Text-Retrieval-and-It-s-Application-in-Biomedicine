She had also developed an acute confusional state for two days prior to her admission. She had been admitted five months ago with an episode of chest infection which was successfully treated with antibiotics. In the previous four years she had suffered from an episode of transient ischaemic attack (TIA).\\nPrevious investigations had shown a normal computer tomography (CT) scan of the head, active rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. On this occasion she was afebrile, normotensive and had an irregularly irregular pulse rate of 150 bpm. Further cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination was unremarkable and a detailed neurological examination did not reveal any significant abnormality.\\nAn electrocardiogram showed fast atrial fibrillation (AF) for which she was treated with digoxin, warfarin & beta blocker for further optimisation. An in-patient trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated a mobile mass in the left atrium (figure ). Subsequent trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TOE) revealed a mobile large left atrial mass (2.7 cm \u00d7 3.5 cm) attached to the fossa ovalis region in the inter-atrial septum, prolapsing into the left ventricle through the mitral valve in diastole (figure &).\\nThe patient declined surgical treatment in view of the risks involved, & died a few weeks later whilst on conservative therapy.", "age": "[[77.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8635340': 1, '15084572': 1, '8976898': 1, '8223737': 1, '22778750': 2, '10221144': 1, '32685152': 2, '14609975': 1, '15894750': 1, '15713867': 1, '19077209': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7343351-1': 1, '3384962-1': 1}"}
