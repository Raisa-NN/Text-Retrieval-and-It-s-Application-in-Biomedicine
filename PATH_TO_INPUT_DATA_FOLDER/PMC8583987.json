He presented to the emergency department complaining of a two-day history of perianal pain and swelling followed by right lower quadrant abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dysuria. The patient denied a history of fever or other systematic symptoms. During the examination, the patient looked well and alert, but he was anxious and tachycardic with a heart rate reaching 128 beats per minute. Other vital signs were normal. Abdominal examination revealed a mildly distended abdomen with severe right lower quadrant tenderness, but there was no guarding. On perianal examination, a small induration was noted on the left side of the gluteal region extending to the perineum with overlying skin erythema. An extensive subcutaneous crepitation was felt on the perineum reaching the left scrotum and medial upper thigh. The digital rectal exam was unremarkable of any masses, collections, cavitation, or bleeding.\\nBlood investigations showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 14.20 x 1,000/mm3) with neutrophil predominance, acute kidney injury (serum creatinine: 172 umol/L), hyperglycemia (glucose: 10.5 mmol/L), deranged serum electrolytes (sodium: 130 mmol/L, potassium: 3.2 mmol/L, and chloride: 88 mmol/L), and metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap due to lactic acidosis. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed by the emergency physician before consulting the surgical team. The images showed edema, fat stranding, and fascial thickening of the perineum with extensive emphysema extending through the pelvic, prevesical, and posterior pararenal retroperitoneal spaces bilaterally, and into the scrotum and upper inner thighs distally (Figure ).\\nIncidental finding of bilateral patchy consolidation on the lower cuts of the lungs was suggestive of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.\\nWhile the initial images did not identify a source of the infection, rectal pathology was suspected. The patient received broad-spectrum antibiotics, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin for a provisional diagnosis of Fournier\u2019s gangrene due to perianal abscess. After the initial assessment, the patient started spiking fever (temperature 38.4\u00b0C). The decision was made to take the patient urgently for debridement of the perianal region. Bilateral vertical incisions were made to access the ischiorectal fossae. On the left side, the devitalized tissue was limited to a small area of the subcutaneous, and only minimal pus was drained and sent for cultures. The subcutaneous tissue on the right side was healthy. As the intraoperative findings were localized and debrided thoroughly, we packed the wounds with iodine-soaked iodoform and opted to terminate the surgery as the patient became tachypneic, hypotensive, and more acidotic. The patient was shifted to an intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively. A pelvic CT with rectal contrast was obtained the next morning, to rule out rectal pathology, which showed no rectal or colonic contrast leak with stable inflammatory features observed in the previous imaging. Postoperatively, the antimicrobial therapies were upgraded to meropenem, metronidazole, linezolid, and caspofungin, and then adjusted according to cultures\u2019 sensitivity, which grew Streptococcus anginosus and Escherichia coli. The fever subsided after 48 hours and the patient\u2019s biochemical markers were improving.\\nOn the fourth day of admission, the patient was taken for a second look at the perianal wounds and bilateral diagnostic laparoscopy of the retroperitoneum (Figure ).\\nThe patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position with the bed flexed at the waistline. After securing 10 mm and 5 mm ports, blunt dissection was done with care so as not to violate the peritoneum until reaching the hypochondrium superiorly and the internal inguinal ring inferiorly. A moderate amount of pus was noted. Multiple irrigation cycles were done until the tissues looked healthy. A 15Fr Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted and the ports removed and the steps repeated on the left side. The patient's condition improved postoperatively, substantiating no further trips to the operating room. Wound dressing was performed regularly at the bedside. The drains were draining a small amount of fluid and were removed shortly. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated on the 13th day of admission, which showed the resolution of the signs of RNF. The patient was discharged home after 21 days of admission, and he was faring well during outpatient follow-up for wound management for a month after discharge.", "age": "[[28.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29559069': 1, '26172354': 1, '33159770': 1, '25593960': 1, '23753218': 1, '19228540': 1, '1576505': 1, '34790448': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
