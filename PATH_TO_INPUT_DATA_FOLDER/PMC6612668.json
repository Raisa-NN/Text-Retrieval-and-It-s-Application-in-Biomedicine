Extraluminal percutaneous-endoscopic rendezvous with a self-expanding metal stent for restoring continuity in major bile duct injury: A case series", "patient": "A 40-year-old male presented with a trans-axial thoraco-abdominal gunshot wound. He was hemodynamically unstable, and a damage control laparotomy was performed. Gastric and diaphragmatic injuries were repaired and a grade IV liver injury was packed []. The packs were removed after 24 h and a closed suction drain was left in the subhepatic space. Six days after laparotomy, CT abdomen showed non-perfusion of liver segments 2 and 3, a large central intrahepatic hematoma and a subhepatic collection. A percutaneous ultrasound-guided puncture of the collection returned bile and an 8 Fr pigtail drain was placed. He subsequently developed a persistent bile leak and rising serum bilirubin (13\u201338 mmol/L). ERC demonstrated extravasation of contrast into the subhepatic space and no filling of the proximal bile ducts. MRCP showed complete disruption of the extrahepatic bile duct but an intact confluence. A PTC was performed noting a porto-biliary fistula and an 8 Fr PTBC was positioned into the subhepatic space. At extraluminal PTC/ERC rendezvous a 10 \u00d7 80 mm fully covered SEMS was placed, bridging the defect (). The patient developed haemobilia 48 h later. Angiography showed a bleeding right hepatic artery false aneurism successfully managed with an endovascular stent.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30359781': 1, '21963262': 1, '25180777': 1, '22695431': 1, '28567121': 1, '19465151': 1, '34112197': 1, '21336816': 1, '29351705': 1, '3582182': 1, '7897707': 1, '23279685': 1, '23948203': 1, '23352315': 1, '10561089': 1, '23458568': 1, '31279238': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6612668-1': 2}"}
