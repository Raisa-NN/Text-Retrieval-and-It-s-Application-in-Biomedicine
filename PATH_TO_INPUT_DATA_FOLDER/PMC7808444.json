He underwent tracheoesophageal fistula neoplasty. At 8 months of age, he presented to our hospital with severe pneumonia. Flexible bronchoscopy showed that the membrane portion of trachea was enlarged and the lumen was narrow. The suture was seen on the inferior part of the collapsed trachea. However, there was no gastric fluid leakage from esophagus. For enlarging the stenosis of trachea, a 20\u22177 mm silicone stent was placed 18 mm above the carina. He was followed up each month. Evaluation revealed good breath, no stridor and some granulation was observed at the distal interface between the stent and the trachea at the level above carina from 2 months till the 6th month (at the time of writing this manuscript).", "age": "[[3.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'3723303': 1, '3236182': 1, '15063278': 1, '25616564': 1, '7463284': 1, '26584412': 1, '9498407': 1, '7956423': 1, '25741903': 1, '15532081': 1, '1688757': 1, '18222219': 1, '26807283': 1, '33466208': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
