Ring finger had sustained amputation through the distal phalanx while the little finger had lost the volar soft tissue without exposure of vital structures []. The ring finger defect was covered with a V-Y advancement flap while the raw area over the little finger was covered with full thickness graft form the inner arm [Figure and ]. The graft was secured in place with running horizontal mattress sutures for good edge to edge contact with intermittent loops [], which are then opened [] for the tie-over dressing. The completed dressing is as in .\\nThis technique is simple and reproducible. The operating surgeon can perform the procedure without need an assistant to cut the sutures. The running sutures save time and the suture material. It also makes the overall procedure much quicker. Horizontal mattress sutures ensure the best edge to edge approximation. On contrary to what one may feel, this suture does not have the constricting (purse string) effect of the continuous suture as it is interrupted by the knots in-between for the threads to be tied over. We have been regularly practicing this technique in our cases for the past 2 years, and it is very quick and convenient.\\nNil.\\nThere are no conflicts of interest.", "age": "[[65.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'33208994': 1, '27833280': 1, '15655477': 1, '25289330': 1, '27274139': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
