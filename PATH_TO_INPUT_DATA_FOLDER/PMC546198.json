Plain films were performed at the time which appeared normal (Figure ). Subsequent treatment included multiple intra-articular injections of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic, however her pain and associated restricted movement worsened. She was referred for an orthopaedic surgical opinion and shoulder ultrasound. An arthroscope was performed which demonstrated rotator cuff pathology but failed to reveal the actual cause of the patient's symptoms. One year after the onset of her original symptoms, repeat plain films showed destruction of the glenoid and coracoid process. A bone scan demonstrated increased osteoblastic activity involving the coracoid process and right humeral head and relative photopaenia of the glenoid. Functional thallium scintigraphy showed increased metabolic activity around the right shoulder joint with CT and MRI scanning confirming destruction of the glenoid with an associated soft tissue mass and involvement of the humeral head (Figure ). CT-guided percutaneous biopsy was performed and diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma made.", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'7048533': 1, '29145279': 1, '3833940': 1, '14308098': 1, '27582968': 1, '1198072': 1, '8986657': 1, '11387073': 1, '4646489': 1, '1624489': 1, '8130999': 1, '1895276': 1, '10738419': 1, '14564266': 1, '32063021': 1, '12890243': 1, '7554636': 1, '14962967': 1, '15647117': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'546198-1': 2, '546198-2': 2, '546198-3': 2}"}
