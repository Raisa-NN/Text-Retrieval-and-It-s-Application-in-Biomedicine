A 12-lead ECG showed diffuse PR segment depression and PR segment elevation in lead aVR, consistent with acute pericarditis. On admission, serum troponin I was elevated at 58 pg/ml. SARS COVID-19 PCR testing, other viral serologies, and bacterial testing were all negative. TTE showed a borderline depressed LVEF of 51% and no pericardial effusion. CT coronary angiography showed no coronary artery calcification and non-obstructive coronary artery disease. CMR showed subepicardial and mid-myocardial LGE in the basal, mid, and apical lateral segments accompanied by myocardial edema in mid and apical lateral segments on T2-weighted images. GLS by TTE and CMR was reduced (\u221214% and \u221212% respectively). The patient was diagnosed with acute myopericarditis and was treated with colchicine, ibuprofen, lisinopril, and metoprolol tartrate. He was discharged home in stable clinical condition and was asymptomatic when seen in outpatient cardiology clinic follow-up 4 weeks after discharge.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24064227': 1, '19126426': 1, '34133885': 1, '34419398': 1, '15234435': 1, '21193707': 1, '33757784': 1, '30545455': 1, '34133884': 1, '34246586': 1, '22736428': 1, '34859017': 2, '29025554': 1, '34246585': 1, '23523188': 1, '34237049': 1, '34185046': 1, '34088762': 1, '23158412': 1, '3030117': 1, '34185045': 1, '34934954': 1, '34496880': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8425992-1': 2, '8425992-2': 2, '8425992-3': 2, '8425992-4': 2, '8632021-1': 1}"}
