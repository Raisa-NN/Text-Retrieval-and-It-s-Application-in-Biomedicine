The swelling developed soon after the birth, which gradually increased to the present size of 3.8\u00d72.5 cm. The general health of the patient was normal and medical history revealed no significant health problems. The patient had difficulty in closing the mouth. The swelling was well lobulated and had well-defined margins extending throughout the lower lip. The skin over the swelling appeared normal except for the dryness over it []. Palpation revealed a soft and nontender swelling. The differential diagnosis of hemangioma or arterio venous malformation was narrowed to hemangioma when auscultation revealed no thrill or bruit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings brought to the limelight the diagnosis of hemangioma, which ruled out arteriovenous malformation by the absence of flow voids []. Intralesional injection of triamcinolone under pressure was administered following which complete excision of the lesion was carried out. Histopathological report revealed large dilated blood sinuses with thin walls lined by endothelium. The sinusoidal spaces were filled with red blood cells [Figures and ]. The histopathology conclusively made us arrive at a diagnosis of hemangioma involving both superficial and deeper tissues.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9559692': 1, '31027109': 2, '25593659': 1, '33584042': 1, '20181211': 2, '20976391': 1, '20307769': 1, '23248483': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2827094-1': 1, '6831450-1': 1, '6831450-2': 1}"}
