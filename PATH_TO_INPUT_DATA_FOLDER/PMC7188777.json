He was diagnosed with acute otitis media and placed on oral amoxicillin. Fever and irritability initially resolved but on day 7 of amoxicillin, fever (102\u00b0F) returned along with leukocytosis (20,000 cells/\u03bcL). Intramuscular ceftriaxone was given but within 24 h, he had developed vomiting, right arm weakness, worsening irritability, and persistent fever. Because of the onset of neurologic symptoms, a CT scan of the brain was performed and showed a large left parietal brain mass with midline shift and cerebral edema (). He underwent emergent left parietal craniotomy and evacuation of the brain abscess. Cultures yielded methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 6 weeks. He had resolution of the infection and complete resolution of neurologic symptoms. His previous history included a 36-weeks' gestation to consanguineous Sudanese parents. He was monitored in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first 4 days of life due to low birth weight. In the first year of life, he had two episodes of cellulitis, involving the lower leg and upper eyelid. Both episodes resolved with oral antibiotics. This patient's 4-year-old brother also had recurrent cellulitis and cutaneous abscesses at sites of minimal trauma for a toddler (upper back, face, abdomen).", "age": "[[13.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26019275': 1, '7088114': 1, '10556201': 1, '17244686': 1, '14576362': 1, '6321538': 1, '10359588': 1, '12006103': 1, '23294125': 1, '28894446': 1, '8324226': 1, '7044447': 1, '29651288': 1, '25081842': 1, '16407388': 1, '11753076': 1, '11313242': 1, '6155073': 1, '32391290': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
