On examination, there was tachypnea and tachycardia with dehydration and mild fullness in the epigastric region.\\nPlain X-ray of the chest showed the presence of an abnormal gas shadow in the right paravertebral region in the lower chest []. Ryle's tube was passed and it drained non-bilious aspirate. Barium contrast study revealed the dilatation of the esophagus with stomach in the right side of thorax in a state of volvulus with some contrast passing distally [].\\nAfter the correction of dehydration, the patient was taken for an emergency surgery. On exploration, the stomach was not found in the abdominal cavity and the gastroesophageal junction was at its normal site (). Further exploration confirmed the presence of the entire stomach within the chest cavity. Herniation of the stomach had occurred in the midline through an enlarged esophageal hiatus with the stomach in a state of mesenterioaxial volvulus. The gastric volvulus was reduced followed by the repair of the hiatal defect with gastropexy.
