He also underwent a traditional bilateral GON pulsed radiofrequency ablation (also landmark-guided) with pain relief for 4-6 months. Other pertinent history includes chronic neck pain without radiculopathy and post-traumatic stress disorder. Due to the success of the prior pulsed radiofrequency ablation, a PRFA of the bilateral greater occipital nerves was planned, this time under ultrasound guidance.\\nUsing a linear, high frequency ultrasound probe, the GON and occipital artery were visualized. First one and then a second standard radiofrequency probe needle with 10 millimeter active tips was advanced in-plane with the beam until adjacent to the GON on either side. PRFA was performed twice at each site with a rate of 2 Hertz and duration of 20 milliseconds for 120 seconds at a temperature between 38\u201342 degrees Centigrade. The procedure was tolerated well without complications and his occipital neuralgia was completely relieved for several months.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34526815': 1, '28882864': 1, '20492581': 1, '17171613': 1, '20415731': 1, '21860751': 1, '20674409': 1, '24244924': 2, '30140522': 1, '20301822': 1, '17257236': 1, '30275783': 1, '20299347': 1, '25680724': 1, '25878625': 1, '19319048': 1, '30407333': 1, '20607896': 1, '24282778': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3833045-1': 2, '3821125-1': 1}"}
