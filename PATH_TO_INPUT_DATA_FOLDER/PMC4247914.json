In 2006, she received chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 2010, after detection of metastasis into liver, she had received chemotherapy again. On her neurological examination, she had paraparesis (left lower extremity: 2/5, right lower extremity: 3/5) and urinary incontinence. On her spinal MRI, we detected an intramedullary and highly gadolinium enhancing lesion with regular borders (). We performed a total T12 laminectomy and almost totally excised the lesion microscopically. The lesion was very adherent to neural tissue. On postoperative MRIs, we saw that the inner part of the lesion was emptied, but the parts adherent to neural tissue were still detectable (). Postoperatively, patient's paraparesis deteriorated (2/5). Pathological examination of the lesion was coherent with metastasis of breast carcinoma. Histopathological examinationof breast tumor revealed tumor infiltration (), cytokeratin expression (), also mammaglobin, estrogen, androgen and progesteron receptor status (Figures , , , and ). The patient has been taken into radiotherapy. On her three-month follow-ups, she did not have any amelioration on her neurological examination.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'6650133': 1, '20668501': 1, '8857717': 1, '23001042': 1, '20856667': 1, '23778028': 1, '19896917': 1, '22713736': 1, '15526223': 1, '21757849': 1, '25477971': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
