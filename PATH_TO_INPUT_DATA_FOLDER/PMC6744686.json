The symptoms worsened over the preceding week, notably the fever and headache with associated neck pain and acute confusion. It was not known if the patient had a history of diarrhoea preceding presentation to hospital.\\nHe was diagnosed with HIV infection approximately 2 years prior. His CD4 count was 2 cells/\u03bcL on admission and HIV viral load was 49,925 copies/mL 6 months earlier. His accompanying relative reported that he had been taking fixed dose combination antiretroviral therapy i.e., tenofovir, emtricitibine and efavirenz, but had defaulted treatment.\\nOn examination, vital signs were all within normal limits. He had severe oral candidiasis and was confused with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 12/15 with meningism. There were no focal neurological deficits and the rest of the clinical examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray showed clear lung fields with no abnormalities. No further radiological testing was performed.\\nA full septic workup was done on admission. All results were within normal parameters, with the exception of the following outliers: (i) The C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values were elevated at 130 mg/L and 125 mm/hr. respectively, suggesting an inflammatory process, (ii) Pre-renal impairment was evident by an elevated urea of 13.5 mmol/L and normal creatinine, (iii) Full blood count revealed a normal white cell count, but neutrophilia on the differential count of 8.49 \u00d7 109/L. (iv) The cerebrospinal fluid was grossly purulent, with numerous gram negative bacilli and inflammatory cells on the gram stain. Biochemistry on the CSF revealed an elevated protein (9.90 g/L), reduced glucose (0.1 mmol/L) and markedly elevated adenosine deaminase (ADA) of > 120 IU/L. Gene Xpert MTB/Rif Ultra (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) on the CSF was negative.\\nBased on the above clinical and laboratory findings, the patient was diagnosed with acute bacterial meningitis. The exact causative agent was still to be determined. Empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone at a dose of 2 g 12 hourly was administered to cover for the common causes of bacterial meningitis. Intravenous corticosteroid therapy with dexamethasone at a dose of 8 mg 8 hourly was added to reduce intracranial inflammation and prevent long term neurological sequelae.\\nThe following day, based on the elevated ADA and ESR results (despite a negative GeneXpert MTB/Rif Ultra result), oral first line anti-tuberculosis therapy was initiated for possible concomitant tuberculous meningitis. A combination tablet to be taken daily containing rifampicin 600 mg, isoniazid 300 mg, pyrazinamide 1600 mg and ethambutol 1100 mg was given. The patient was transferred to an isolation room with airborne precautions instituted. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) was not re-initiated for reasons unknown to us.\\nOn day three, his condition deteriorated, with a decrease in GCS to 10/15. Antibiotic therapy was escalated to intravenous meropenem at a dose of 2 g 8 hourly to cover for a possible extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacillary meningitis. The patient was kept on intravenous ceftriaxone despite advice from microbiology to escalate the patient to meropenem only. The CSF grew a non-lactose fermenter with colony morphology in keeping with a Salmonella species. The colonies were presumptively identified as Salmonella Group D with a latex agglutination assay (Wellcolex Colour Salmonella Agglutination (Remel, London, UK)). These findings were promptly communicated to the treating clinicians. Blood cultures taken on admission failed to yield any significant growth.\\nOn day four of admission, the Vitek 2 (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) automated system confirmed the CSF isolate to be Salmonella group. Serotyping was performed according to the White Kauffman Le Minor scheme, which revealed the organism to be a Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis strain. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin, identified on the Vitek 2 system was confirmed with E-tests (bioM\u00e9rieux, France), with MICs of 0.064 \u03bcg/mL and 0.023 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The isolate was susceptible to meropenem on the Vitek 2 system, with an MIC of \u22640.25 \u03bcg/mL. Of note, the organism showed resistance to colistin on Vitek 2 which was confirmed by broth micro dilution with an MIC of 4 \u03bcg/ml. A stool specimen was not submitted for investigation of potential colistin-resistant Gram-negative enteric organisms which may have served as the source for colistin resistance through plasmid mediated transfer of mcr genes. The lack of active management from the side of the clinicians prevented further samples from reaching the laboratory.\\nFollowing release of culture and AST results, meropenem was stopped and ceftriaxone was continued. Unfortunately, despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment, the patient succumbed to his illness and demised on day six of admission. The outcome of this patient further supports the evidence found by Keddy et al. (2015) that a GCS of \u226413 on presentation to hospital is a strong predicter of mortality in patients with non-typhoidal Salmonella meningitis [].\\nAn in-house PCR was performed on the isolate, but it was negative for the mcr-1 gene. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed with the Illumina MiSeq platform. No mcr (mcr1\u20138) or known colistin resistance-conferring mutations were found in the pmrAB, pmrHFIJKLMD, arnE, arnC, phoPQ, mgrB and acrAB genes (Additional file ). Based on these findings, we can conclude that a novel mechanism is responsible for the colistin resistance in this Salmonella Enteritidis isolate. A MLST (multilocus sequence typing) analysis of the genome using MLST 2.0 () showed that it was of ST11. The isolate was confirmed as a human pathogen by PathogenFinder [], and no SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) or deletion of genes were found in the pathogenic/virulence gene repertoire (Additional file ). The isolate contained five of the 12 known Salmonellae pathogenicity islands viz., C63PI, SPI-5, SPI-13, SPI-3, SPI-14, and two plasmid replicons i.e., IncFIB(S) and IncFII(S), suggesting the presence of at least one IncF-type plasmid (Additional file ). Six prophages were also found in the genome of the isolate, including Fels-2-like prophage genes (Fig. ).\\nA phylogenetic analysis of the isolate, with 398 other S. Enteritidis isolates obtained from NCBI/Patric () that were isolated between 1953 and 2019 from humans, poultry, cattle, mice etc. in various countries and continents, was undertaken. The results are shown in Fig. .\\nThe assembled and annotated genome sequence of this S. Enteritidis EC20120916 strain is available at Genbank under accession number SHPL00000000 (PRJNA PRJNA521953).", "age": "[[34.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22587967': 1, '32793135': 1, '26449942': 1, '28416545': 1, '23730630': 1, '27153928': 1, '19332669': 1, '31064835': 1, '34959570': 1, '29673734': 1, '24204795': 1, '28264046': 1, '32277132': 1, '31988374': 1, '32430406': 1, '27548315': 1, '33234606': 1, '26180063': 1, '33323413': 1, '29568630': 1, '31521113': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
