The patient had never been treated before because she was afraid of surgery. She had no history of migraine headaches or cardiac diseases. She had never smoked cigarettes, never had high blood pressure, and never been overweight. Her only medication was 20 mg sinvastatin once a day, and her last lipid profile, and all blood tests were normal. Except for the large varicose veins in her left lower limb, physical examination was normal, including normal peripheral pulses and absence of bruits. The patient was treated in the Trendelenburg position with a total of 10 ml of 3% polidocanol foam via direct punctures, 5 mL into an 8 mm diameter great saphenous vein and 5 mL into large collaterals in the leg. Foam was prepared with a 1:4 ratio of liquid to room air, using the Tessari technique involving 40 passes of agitation through a three-way stopcock using one 5 mL syringe and one 3 mL syringe. With ultrasound guidance, foam was injected immediately after each of three preparations, 5 mL, 2.5 mL, and 2.5 mL. No air boluses occurred. Ultrasound scanning showed no foam in the deep venous system. The patient remained lying down for 10 minutes after the injections, before being discharged wearing compression stockings. Less than 1 hour after leaving hospital, impairment of speech capacity was observed. She encountered difficulties when she tried to talk, with incomplete and incomprehensible words. No other alterations were noted. She was taken to another hospital, where the clinical presentation was misdiagnosed as an allergic reaction. One gram of hydrocortisone IV was infused and 20 mg prednisone was prescribed per day for 5 days. The next morning she came to the office to report the allergic reaction. After detailed history taking and physical examination, including the Wells DVT clinical model, the only alteration detected was aphasia. This was Broca\u2019s aphasia, identified by loss of speech and writing capabilities, with no impairment of comprehension. A neurological examination found no signs or symptoms of hemiparesis or hemiplegia. Cerebrovascular ischemia was suggested, and the patient\u2019s daughter became fairly angry about the diagnosis of ischemia, which she considered exaggerated. Both mother and daughter left the clinic and refused a neurological consultation. Two days later, the patient came to the office, reporting that she was almost recovered and reaffirming her belief that she had suffered an allergic reaction. After an appropriate explanation, 1 week later, a normal transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained and magnetic resonance showed a recent cerebrovascular ischemia in Broca\u2019s area ( ). A transesophageal bubble study echocardiogram performed a few days later revealed a patent foramen ovale ( ). The patient\u2019s daughter\u2019s became very upset again, and, despite a complete recovery by the patient, the doctor-patient relationship broke down almost completely. It wasn\u2019t possible to continue investigations. More explanation and discussion followed, in which the intention to publish this complication was decisive to achieving greater comprehension about what had occurred. Both the patient and her daughter gave permission for publication in writing.", "age": "[[64.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23998692': 1, '23864535': 1, '5094838': 1, '1999032': 1, '23559590': 1, '15868517': 1, '6694427': 1, '23622926': 1, '22312067': 1, '21928000': 1, '27152642': 1, '23390217': 1, '22801868': 1, '20635319': 1, '9428249': 1, '1622623': 1, '21840152': 1, '19952380': 1, '30787953': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
