His Rockwood Clinical Frailty Score was 2\u20133. Positive findings on clinical examination were hepatomegaly and generalised weakness. Initial observations included peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97% on room air and a temperature of 38.4\u00b0C. Chest X-ray on admission was unremarkable. Nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, in keeping with COVID-19 infection.\\nOver the following week, our patient had continuing fever and required an increasing flow of supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate SpO2. He was started on empirical antibiotics in case of coexistent bacterial infection. A treatment escalation plan had been discussed with the patient and he had declined admission to intensive care for ventilatory support. The patient was increasingly dyspnoeic and hypoxic with SpO2 ~80% on 19 L/min oxygen and rapidly deteriorating with respiratory distress. Repeat chest X-ray demonstrated new bilateral air space opacification, in keeping with severe pneumonitis ().", "age": "[[72.5, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'32075786': 1, '19368420': 1, '34660032': 2, '32457999': 1, '32929415': 1, '32721528': 1, '32192578': 1, '32652164': 1, '33419750': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8500242-1': 1}"}
