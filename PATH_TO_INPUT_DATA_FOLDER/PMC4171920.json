The histopathology revealed a keratinous cyst lined by stratified squamous lining with few keratohyaline granules in the superficial luminal layers and mimicking the interfollicular portion of epidermis []. The lumen showed flakes of anucleated keratin. The cyst was surrounded by cellular nodule, comprising of crisscross and vaguely storiform cells with ill-defined cytoplasm and oval to spindle nuclei. The cells showed engulfed hemosiderin and scattered inflammatory cells with occasional multinucleated giant cell []. Areas of hemorrhage and foreign body giant cells with cholesterol and foreign body (possibly sutures from previous surgery) clefts were also seen. The cyst did not show an epidermal connection on multiple serial sections.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18165728': 1, '1677343': 1, '4814930': 1, '1474487': 1, '16445414': 1, '18032953': 1, '25284857': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
