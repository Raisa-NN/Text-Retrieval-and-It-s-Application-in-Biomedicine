A choroidal nevus was diagnosed 15 years earlier in the left eye, but no photographs were taken. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right (OD) and 20/40 in the left eye (OS). The right fundus was unremarkable. The left fundus revealed a small juxtapapillary choroidal melanocytic tumor with overlying subretinal fluid and orange pigment without any halo and drusen []. The mass measured 5 \u00d7 4 mm2 in basal diameter.\\nUltrasonography showed the lesion to be 2 mm thick, with low-to-medium internal reflectivity. Optical coherence tomography revealed subretinal fluid without retinal degenerative changes []. There was hyperautofluorescence of orange pigment on the tumor surface. A diagnosis of small choroidal melanoma was rendered and treatment with a notched I125 plaque combined with one session of transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) was provided. At the time of plaque placement, fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed and genetic testing revealed monosomy 3. At 1 year after treatment, the visual acuity was 20/40 and the tumor remains regressed and flat with no subretinal fluid [].", "age": "[[64.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16369739': 1, '17698747': 1, '19667334': 1, '8622452': 1, '9097773': 1, '20844685': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
