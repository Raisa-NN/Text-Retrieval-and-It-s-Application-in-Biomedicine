The DWI showed acute infarction involving right inferolateral pons, brachium pontis and superior cerebellum (Fig. a). The right AICA was absent on MRA (Fig. b) and BPAS-MRI (Fig. c). The comprehensive diagnosis was considered as right AICA congenital aplasia, and other causes of the infarction needed to be explored. Finally, a proximal atrial fibrillation was found through long-term monitoring, and the cardiac embolism was presumed as the etiology of infarction.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24023533': 1, '21123982': 1, '8431134': 1, '16286392': 1, '29150242': 1, '34330224': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8323314-1': 2, '8323314-2': 2}"}
