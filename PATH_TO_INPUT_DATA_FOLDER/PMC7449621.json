Since the evacuation, she had multiple episodes of heavy vaginal bleeding, which resolved spontaneously without taking any medication. In between these episodes, she had mild irregular bleeding. On examination, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Her hemoglobin level was 12.0 g/dL, HCG level was less than 2 mIU/mL, which ruled out trophoblastic disease. Pelvic examination revealed a normal-sized uterus and the os was closed with minimal bleeding. Transabdominal ultrasound of the pelvis showed a bulky uterus, with an endometrial thickness of 1.6 cm and increased vascularity of the uterus (Figure ), which was later confirmed by Doppler ultrasound. A provisional diagnosis of arteriovenous malformation was considered, confirmed on MRI. Selective uterine artery embolization was done. Follow-up after 15 days, four weeks, and 12 months was uneventful. She was put on injectable progesterone as a method of contraception, as she did not desire pregnancy.", "age": "[[38.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19513893': 1, '20488655': 1, '11796897': 1, '18669767': 1, '21963109': 1, '17018490': 1, '21904854': 1, '28439193': 1, '10210350': 1, '15840807': 1, '8841239': 1, '11846717': 1, '6409944': 1, '1797218': 1, '14551016': 1, '17060424': 1, '16250925': 1, '11730765': 1, '9423660': 1, '32864239': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7449621-1': 2, '7449621-2': 2, '7449621-3': 2}"}
