The swelling was initially pea sized and gradually increased to its final dimensions. The patient gave a history of extraction of grossly carious lower right deciduous molar with no reduction in the size of the swelling. On extraoral examination, facial asymmetry with a solitary localised oval-shaped swelling measuring 20 mm \u00d7 20 mm was seen on the right side of the face near the body of mandible []. On palpation, the swelling was noted to be well defined, hard in consistency, non-tender, non-pulsatile and non-fluctuant. Localised ipsilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy was also evident. Intraorally, obliteration of the lower buccal vestibule on the right side was noted []. OPG revealed 'onion skin' appearance at the inferior border of the mandibular body suggestive of a periosteal reaction [].\\nBased on the clinical and radiographic findings, the lesion was diagnosed as Garre's osteomyelitis and surgical recontouring under general anaesthesia was planned []. Extraoral approach was used to expose the lesion, and the excess bony mass was excised using surgical bur and handpiece. The excised bone fragments [] were subjected to histopathological examination which revealed trabeculae of bone with osteoblastic rimming and reversal lines together with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. The microscopic picture confirmed the diagnosis of Garre's osteomyelitis. The patient was followed up 3 months post-surgery with no recurrence of the lesion [].", "age": "[[8.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'6951157': 1, '23812085': 1, '12966271': 1, '33642412': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
