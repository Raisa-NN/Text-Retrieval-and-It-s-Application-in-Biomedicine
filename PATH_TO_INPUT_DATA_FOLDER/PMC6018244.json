The patient reported that the swelling began in his right hand six days after the chemotherapy infusion, and was associated with tender, itchy, and notably darkened forearm veins. He also described shooting pains coming from the darkened veins. He denied any other rash or erythema, and endorsed chills but no fever. Physical examination was remarkable for mildly tender, deeply hyperpigmented veins originating at the site of his chemotherapy infusion site, and edema of the dorsum of the right hand without warmth or erythema (). Labs were significant only for neutropenia (ANC 900). An upper extremity ultrasound was performed to rule out a DVT associated with this possible thrombophlebitis which was negative.\\nThe patient was diagnosed with serpentine supravenous hyperpigmentation (SSH) and discharged home with supportive care on hospital day 2. Upon follow-up in the office four months later, the original SSH in his right arm had improved significantly (), but he developed new SSH in his left arm where he was now getting his chemotherapy infusions ().\\nIn this instance, however, he did not feel any pain or discomfort from the darkened veins.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16112371': 1, '33447068': 1, '23330569': 1, '10954672': 1, '21079327': 1, '991154': 1, '25808569': 1, '15857462': 1, '1559000': 1, '25937137': 1, '23745227': 1, '22794822': 1, '26502692': 1, '29951170': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
