Two weeks after the commencement of clozapine (dose 150 mg), the patient started to have watery diarrhea. In the laboratory tests, no eosinophilia was detected for this patient. Fecal calprotectin was elevated at 4112 \u03bcg/g, and C-reactive protein was 102 mg/L at its peak. Celiac disease antibodies and cytomegalovirus antibodies were negative, as well as all bacterial and viral and parasitic samples from stool. The patient declined acute colonoscopy. Clozapine was discontinued because of the suspected clozapine related colitis with severe symptoms, and after that, his diarrhea symptoms disappeared without any other treatment. The patient had slightly elevated level of eosinophils in peripheral blood before commencement of clozapine and again after clozapine was discontinued and diarrhea symptoms had abated.", "age": "[[23.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29424803': 1, '18004122': 1, '22274140': 1, '30280578': 1, '21914234': 1, '12503844': 1, '18626275': 1, '31123109': 1, '23882307': 1, '29554696': 1, '16415714': 1, '9930639': 1, '9169975': 1, '25514065': 1, '28784369': 1, '17711574': 2, '27867684': 1, '23964139': 1, '23842012': 1, '9669191': 1, '17685758': 1, '31335444': 1, '22760348': 1, '29991947': 2, '23816504': 1, '10702809': 1, '25811003': 1, '23945831': 1, '32332465': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7188262-1': 2, '7188262-2': 2, '7188262-3': 2, '1997107-1': 1, '6016221-1': 1}"}
