He was on home oxygen and presented with abdominal pain, dyspnea at rest, and intermittent small volume hemoptysis. On admission, the patient was in acute renal failure, acute hepatic failure, and suspected acute decompensated heart failure, complicated by sepsis secondary to right lower lobe pneumonia.\\nHe was treated empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics and underwent multiple imaging modalities, including CT pulmonary angiography, which showed no of evidence for pulmonary emboli. His abdominal pain was investigated with abdominal ultrasound, which identified a stable AAA without adequate visualization of the aortoiliac bifurcation. The patient failed to improve on broad spectrum antibiotics, and had negative blood, sputum and urine cultures. He deteriorated to hemodynamic collapse, requiring the addition of inotropes and vasopressors, with transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of suspected cardiogenic shock.", "age": "[[64.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27470455': 1, '9737613': 1, '9016967': 1, '1990167': 1, '34285907': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
