For the past several months, he had been misdiagnosed as having idiopathic scoliosis and was being treated with bracing and physical therapy without any improvement. On examination, he had a significant scoliotic deformity (i.e., tilt to the left) with a reduced range of lumbar motion and/muscle spasm restricting right lateral flexion []. He had no other focal neurological deficits. Plain radiographs showed a primary right lumbar curve (Cobb angle 30\u00b0 and 70 mm deviation) without a rotational spinal deformity []. The spinal CT scan and MR studies showed a right paramedian LDH at the L4\u2013L5 level [-]. Following a conventional right L4\u2013L5 open discectomy, the \u201cdeformity\u201d resolved, and the patient was neurologically intact demonstrating no recurrent symptoms 2 years later [].", "age": "[[24.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11752526': 1, '11246383': 1, '21294611': 1, '32637212': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
