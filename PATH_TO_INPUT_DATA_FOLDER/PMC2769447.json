A left inguinal herniorraphy was performed uneventfully and there were no other abnormalities. 10 years ago, his swelling recurred. He was operated for recurrent hernia. During surgery, he had a recurrent inguinal hernia and herniorraphy was performed. Post-operatively, he was asymptomatic until 5 years ago when started developing painless recurrent inguinal mass of a similar nature. It was initially reducible and was ignored by patient. However about 1 month prior to surgery, the mass became irreducible. There was no associated pain or obstructive bowel symptoms. Attempts to reduce the swelling were not successful. On table, an incision was made over the old scar and explored. There was no hernial sac or recurrences. The spermatic cord was isolated and traced distally into the scrotum. A large lipoma was seen arising from the inguinal cord (). It was dissected and excised. The cord was long and redundant (). The cord structures were preserved and no signs of invasion or malignancies were seen. Orchidopexy was performed and abdomen closed in the usual manner. He was well upon discharge. He was followed up in the clinic and post-operatively uneventful after discharge. He was discharged to be followed up at the primary care and has been problem free for almost 2 years since surgery. Histopathology reports confirmed the diagnosis of lipoma.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15105999': 1, '15233237': 1, '15965579': 1, '11923616': 1, '11196394': 1, '23995475': 1, '10362092': 1, '12112356': 1, '19918377': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
