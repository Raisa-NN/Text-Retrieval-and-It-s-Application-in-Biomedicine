He had past medical history of ex-smoker (35 packs/year), hypertension and hypothyroidism. He presented a myelodysplastic syndrome of 3-year progression. When he was 60 years old, he underwent resection of a melanoma in the lower right lobe.\\nLaboratory evaluation showed low number of leukocytes (1,900/mm3), a hematocrit of 31% and platelet count of 280,000/mm3. LDH was 414 U/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 100 mm and CRP was 20 mg/dL. The rest of the laboratory data were normal.\\nHRCT showed mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with tracheal and right lobe involvement but no lung parenchymal involvement (). Fibrobronchoscopy showed the lower part of the tracheal wall with edema and infiltrates in pavement epithelium; however, tracheal biopsy for acid-fast bacilli and malignant cells was negative (). Symptoms worsened and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) was performed to get samples of lymph nodes. The presence of necrotizing caseous granuloma confirmed the diagnosis of EBTB.\\nPatient was treated with isoniazid (5 mg/kg), rifampicin (10 mg/kg), pyrazinamide (25 mg/kg) and ethambutol (20 mg/kg) orally, during 9 months. Symptoms and serum inflammatory markers improved considerably.", "age": "[[73.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'7991879': 1, '25197570': 1, '2121113': 1, '2248533': 1, '7991884': 1, '1766161': 1, '20299630': 1, '10669679': 1, '25620110': 1, '34616799': 1, '24866460': 1, '21499709': 1, '24035300': 1, '1395814': 1, '9525297': 1, '26124914': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
