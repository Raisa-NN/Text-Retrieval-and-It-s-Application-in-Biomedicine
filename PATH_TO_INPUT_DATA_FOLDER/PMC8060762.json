Head computed tomography (CT) imaging showed obstructive\\nhydrocephalus of unknown cause. Prior to the headache, the patient had no history of\\nother diseases. His symptoms improved after he received mannitol (125 ml intravenous\\n[i.v.], every 12 h, days 1\u20137) treatment to reduce the intracranial pressure.\\nSubsequently, the patient continued to experience occasional painful headaches, but\\nhe did not seek further medical advice for a diagnosis. In October 2018, the patient\\npresented to the Department of Neurosurgery, Fujian Medical University Union\\nHospital with numbness of the left lower extremity and worsening headache. Head CT\\nimaging revealed an abnormal density shadow with supratentorial ventricular\\ndilatation hydrops in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. Magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI) revealed multiple nodules, masses and abnormal signals of Gyri in the\\nbilateral cerebellar hemispheres, bilateral cerebellar oedema and hydrocephalus\\n(). Partial\\nresection of the right cerebellum, external ventricular drainage reservoir placement\\nand cranioplasty were performed. Pathological examination of the right cerebellar\\nmass showed that there was lymphocyte infiltration and multiple foci of necrosis\\n(). There were\\nlarge cells with small lymphocytes around and some of the cells had binucleate\\nnucleoli. Reed\u2013Sternberg (RS) cells were detected. Based on immunohistochemistry,\\nin situ hybridization and T cell receptor gene rearrangement\\nfindings, the diagnosis of CNS-HL was made. The HL was mixed cellularity HL (MCHL)\\nwith a lot of monoclonal T cell infiltration. Immunohistochemical staining showed\\nthat the large cells were stained as follows: CD30+, cyclinD1+, MUM-1+, Pax5\u00b1,\\nCD15\u00b1, Bob-1\u00b1, KI67+ (40%), CD20\u2013, CD21\u2013, CD10\u2013, Oct-2\u2013 and ALK\u2013. Small lymphoma\\ncells were stained as follows: CD2+, CD3+, CD5+, CD43+, BCL-2+, TIA-1+, CD7\u00b1,\\nBCL-6\u00b1, KI67+ (20\u201330%), CD20\u2013, CD21\u2013, CD56\u2013, CD10\u2013, GRB\u2013, perforin\u2013, TDT\u2013, MPO\u2013 and\\nSOX11\u2013. The rate of positive immunostaining of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was\\n15%. The peripheral blood Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-DNA level was 1.26 x\\n104 copies/ml. EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) staining was positive.\\nThe karyotype was 46,XY. No gene mutations were found for lymphoma hotspot genes by\\nnext generation sequencing.\\nPostoperative positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) imaging revealed no\\nhypermetabolic lesion caused by residual lymphoma. There was a hypermetabolic lesion\\nat the left cerebellar tonsil after surgery, which was considered to be lymphoma\\ninfiltration (Deauville Score 5) (). There were no abnormal findings in the rest of the body\\n(suvs 2.4 in liver background and Max 1.3 in mediastinal large blood pool).\\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed there were 7.2 \u00d7 107\\nnucleated cells: 97% were mononuclear cells and 3% were multinucleated cells. Pan's\\ntest was positive and the total protein level in the CSF was 866 mg/l. No tumour\\ncells were found in the CSF.\\nThe patient was diagnosed with a primary CNS classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (MCHL) with\\nthe help of a multidisciplinary treatment meeting. The patient was first treated\\nwith 3 g/m2 methotrexate (i.v., once a day, day 1) and 1 g/m2\\ncytarabine (i.v., every 12 h, days 2 + 3). Unfortunately, drug-induced acute renal\\ninjury and myelosuppression developed. Subsequently, the patient was treated with\\nanti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies (200 mg sintilimab, i.v.,\\nonce a day, day 1, every 3 weeks). After four courses of treatment, PET-CT imaging\\nrevealed no cell infiltration at the left cerebellar tonsil (Deauville Score 1)\\n(). The CSF was\\nnormal and a complete response was achieved. Anti-PD-1 antibodies (200 mg\\nsintilimab, i.v., once a day, day 1, every 3 weeks) was continued for two courses.\\nDuring this period, lumbar puncture and intrathecal injections of 50 mg cytarabine\\n(once a day, day 1) and 5 mg dexamethasone (once a day, day 1) were administrated\\nfor six courses. After six courses of treatment, there was no residual lesion on\\ncranial MRI performed on 15 September 2019. No significant drug-related adverse\\nevents were observed. The patient has been followed up every 3 months and was last\\nseen in December 2020. No relapse has occurred.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12605396': 1, '20975772': 1, '22791223': 1, '15746048': 1, '17420914': 1, '23139103': 1, '20157609': 1, '11466326': 1, '14604957': 1, '27496310': 1, '29122656': 1, '11265233': 1, '28961037': 1, '12576425': 1, '18924115': 1, '18591379': 1, '15101736': 1, '20945117': 1, '25438809': 1, '15370222': 1, '33874776': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
