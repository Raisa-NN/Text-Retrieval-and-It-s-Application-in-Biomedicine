The fever occurred daily, was high grade (39 \u00b0C/102 \u00b0F), usually occurred in evenings and ceased after taking paracetamol. No night sweats were present. She had mild dyspnoea on exertion and worsening of otherwise chronic cervicalgia. Her medical history revealed she recently (Oct.10th 2019) received her 8th cycle of chemotherapy with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) due to a disseminated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. She had a medical history of resection of a malignant rectal tumour with reported full remission (from 2011), splenectomy, and chronic gastritis, presence of a mechanical artificial aortic valve on anticoagulation and chronic anaemia. She was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1000 mg/12 h p.o.) 3 months previously for 10 days due to fever of unknown origin (FUO) with concomitant thrombocytopenia (41.000/mcL) and anaemia (Hb 8.2 g/dL). Epidemiologic history was unremarkable in the last 6 months: she denied travel, contact with animals, tick or insect bites, or eating raw foods.\\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormalities apart from a fever of 39 \u00b0C and the closing click of the mechanical aortic valve without obvious murmurs.\\nThe chest X-ray was normal with a visible ring of the artificial valve. In laboratory studies, a moderate normocytic anaemia (9.4 g/dL) and hyponatremia (133 mmol/L) were present. CRP was elevated (111 mg/L), leukocytes and thrombocytes were normal, as were the estimated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, renal function and aminotransferases.\\nAn infectious disease specialist was consulted, blood cultures were drawn, empirical antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1200 mg/8 h i.v.) was started and the patient was admitted to the hospital for further workup (Nov.4th 2019). During the next 3 days, the patient remained febrile; TSH, LDH, HIV serology, and blood cultures were normal or negative and an abdominal ultrasound showed a small regenerate of the spleen. After consulting with an infectious disease specialist again, antibiotic treatment was escalated to flucloxacillin (2 g/6 h i.v.) and ceftriaxone (2 g/24 h i.v.). Results of further microbiological workup (urinary Legionella antigen, respiratory PCR panel, blood cultures, urine culture, stool PCR panel, 1,3-beta-D-glucan, serologic testing for Coxiella burnetii, Brucella sp., cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, leptospirosis, Hantaviruses), were all negative. As anaemia worsened, the patient received several transfusions of concentrated erythrocytes. A transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography (TTE and TEE) showed no signs of infectious endocarditis. Fever persisted and after 3 days, antibiotic therapy was again escalated to vancomycin (1 g/12 h i.v.) and cefepime (2 g/8 h i.v.). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed chronic gastritis with no signs of recent gastric bleeding. A slight redness of the left breast was observed but a gynaecological consultation excluded mastitis. As the cause of fever remained unknown despite an extensive work-up, a PET CT scan was performed and showed non-specific activity around the artificial heart valve. After 14 days of therapy with vancomycin and cefepime, the inflammatory markers were significantly lower but still elevated (CRP of 36 mg/L), anaemia was stable (9,3 g/dL) and thrombocyte count was normal (221.000/mcL). The patient gradually became sub to afebrile (body temperature remained below 38 \u00b0C). As there were no signs of bacterial infection antibiotic treatment was discontinued and the patient\u2019s oncologist was consulted. It was concluded that there were no signs of lymphoma progression but further follow-up was needed. The patient was discharged from hospital on November 21th 2019.\\nDuring the subsequent 2 months, the patient still had occasional episodes of fever, chills, malaise and started having night sweats. A control TEE was performed where endocarditis was again excluded. An infectious disease specialist was consulted again; 1,3-beta-D-glucan and serology for C. burnetii and Brucella sp. were repeated and whole blood was sent for bacterial 16S rDNA PCR (29th January 2020).\\nWhile serology remained negative, the 16S rDNA PCR and additional specific PCR for CNM from the blood sample were both positive for CNM. Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg/12 h p.o. was started.\\nThe patient rapidly defervesced after starting treatment with doxycycline and her symptoms completely subsided. On follow up, after 12 days of treatment with doxycycline, the patient was seen at a control appointment. A whole blood and serum sample were sent to the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology for CNM specific PCR detection and detection of antibodies against Anaplasma phagocytophilum, respectively; PCR was still positive for CNM, while detection of antibodies against A. phagocytophilum was negative. She also developed neutropenia. Treatment with doxycycline was prolonged until February 28th 2020 for 4 weeks in total and was discontinued after two subsequent specific PCRs were negative (on February 20th and February 27th 2020). At her latest follow up, no neutropenia was present, no new symptoms had appeared and the patient started seeing her oncologist again. An Indium-111 white blood cell scintigraphy was performed on early follow up, which excluded a septic or infectious process in the left atrium and ventricle, though some nonspecific activity was observed. On long-term follow up for the following 12 months, the patient remained afebrile and successfully finished her chemotherapy.\\nA broad-range 16S rDNA PCR was performed on the patient\u2019s blood sample. Patient\u2019s whole blood with EDTA anticoagulant was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 rpm. A plasma sample (1.5 mL) was collected and concentrated at 14500 rpm for 15 min. Four hundred \u03bcL of a lower portion of the centrifuged plasma sample including pellet was used for nucleic acid extraction with MagNA Pure 24 Total NA Isolation Kit (Roche, Germany) according to the Pathogen 2.0 purification protocol with the input sample volume of 200 \u03bcL and the elution volume of 100 \u03bcL. A broad-range 16S rDNA PCR [] with subsequent sequencing revealed CNM in the patient\u2019s blood sample. An identity match of 97.6% was revealed, using Sequence Match online RDP tool []. A positive control for a broad-range 16S rDNA PCR was Staphylococcus aureus from a pure culture, a negative control was molecular biology grade water. For the confirmation of a detected bacterial pathogen, additional conventional PCRs for a part of groEL gene [] and for a larger part of 16S rDNA [] were performed, both with subsequent sequencing. The sequences were assembled by CLC Main Workbench, version 6.1 software (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) and analyzed with MEGA 5.05 software []. The results after analysis of sequences matched 100% to sequences of CNM from human samples from Germany (Acc. No. EU810406 and Acc. No. EU810404, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis grouped Slovenian patient\u2019s sequence of CNM in European cluster of groEL and 16S rDNA gene sequences from CNM (Additional file Figure , Additional file-Figure ). Positive control for confirmatory PCRs was CNM extracted from a small mammal in Slovenia negative control was molecular biology grade water (Filling the gap on the knowledge of Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis in Europe, Slovenia. In: ESCC AR - ASR Joint Meeting. Marseille; 2017 \"unpublished data\").\\nFor the follow up and for control of treatment, additional whole blood samples with EDTA anticoagulant were obtained. Total nucleic acid extraction from 400 \u03bcL plasma sample was done by EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Qiagen, Germany). Eluates were tested by a specific real-time PCR for groEL gene []. Positive and negative controls were the same as for the confirmatory PCRs. The patient\u2019s samples obtained 12 days later were still positive, but those obtained three and 4 weeks later at additional control visits were negative.\\nAdditionally, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for detection of antibodies was performed in sera sent on initial date and 2 weeks later. Antigens used were of A. phagocytophilum (in-house assay) and of Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Focus Diagnostics, USA), as IFA for detection of antibodies against CNM is not yet available. Antibodies against A. phagocytophilum or E. chaffeensis antigens were not detected.", "age": "[[66.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20220155': 1, '24647019': 1, '30898074': 1, '22515314': 1, '12867563': 1, '25416710': 1, '23696884': 1, '21367991': 1, '21546353': 1, '22212459': 1, '20519481': 1, '24288368': 1, '29556406': 1, '2668764': 1, '34130635': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
