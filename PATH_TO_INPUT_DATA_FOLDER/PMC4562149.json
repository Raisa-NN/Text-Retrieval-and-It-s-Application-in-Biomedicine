Her sample was sent for blood grouping, typing and antibody screening. Blood group was A Rh (D) negative, ccee K- and antibody screen was positive. Further workup revealed anti-C, anti-D and anti-E. There was no history of any RhIG prophylaxis. Fetal ultrasound confirmed severe fetal hydrops and fetal anemia (MCA-PSV >1.5 MOM). First IUT was given with O Rh (D) negative leukoreduced, irradiated PRC of 80% hematocrit (ccee, K-). Fetal blood sampling prior to transfusion showed a Hb level of 0.7 g/dL, Group A Rh (D) positive with ccEe K-and strong DAT positivity. Blood grouping and phenotyping of father revealed Group O Rh (D) positive, CcEe K-. Second IUT was done a week later. The patient went into preterm labor, and a caesarean section was performed at 30 week's gestation. The neonate, however, did not cry immediately after birth. Attempts to resuscitate the neonate failed, and the neonate died in an hour. Cord blood was not available for any further testing in this case.", "age": "[[23.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28316444': 2, '13782144': 1, '34349469': 2, '13604117': 1, '3934960': 1, '8873421': 1, '9149773': 1, '17430075': 1, '23921643': 1, '11422951': 1, '29207719': 1, '26420948': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8294450-1': 1, '5345285-1': 1}"}
