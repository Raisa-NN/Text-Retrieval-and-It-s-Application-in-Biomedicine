Ocular examination revealed retinal detachment in the left eye. The right eye was normal. Ocular ultrasound showed a uveal juxtapapillary echogenic process responsible for retinal detachment which was consistent with enhanced choroidal thickening on the CT scan (Figure ). MRI showed an intraocular lesion of the posterior wall of the posterior chamber, isointense on T1, discretely hyperintense on T2, enhanced after injection of gadolinium, with a retinal detachment (Figure ). Brain MRI showed multiple nodular intra-axial brain secondary lesions hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2 FLAIR, and enhancing intensely after injection of gadolinium (Figure ). The diagnosis of choroidal metastasis was suspected, and given the clinical context, a chest CT was performed, which showed a tumoral process of the lower lobe of the left lung with contralateral tumor nodules (Figure ). The bronchoscopic biopsy of the left lower lobe mass was taken and the pathological examination showed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient was referred to oncology for palliative radiotherapy followed by combination chemotherapy.", "age": "[[47.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30240895': 1, '32420018': 1, '28511491': 1, '33142285': 1, '25827542': 1, '34408441': 1, '34815909': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
