There was no history of nausea and vomiting, motor or sensory symptoms in the limbs, facial bulbar symptoms, sphincter incontinence, and loss of consciousness or seizures. He denied a family history of blood clotting disorders. Physical examination showed his body temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, blood pressure was 130/84 mmHg, heart rate was 72 beats/min, and respiratory rate was 18 beats/min. Neurological examination revealed no positive findings.\\nPeripheral blood test demonstrated mild normocytic normochromic anemia (hemoglobin, 110 g/L, normal range 120\u2013160 g/L; hematocrit 34.8%, normal range 38.0\u201350.8%). The evaluation of thrombophilia showed increased levels of fibrinogen (4.11 g/L, normal range 2.0\u20134.0 g/L), D-dimer (1.4 \u03bcg/ml, normal range 2.0\u20134.0 g/L), AT-III (134%, normal range 80.0\u2013120.0%), and protein C (181%, normal range 65.0\u2013140.0%). All the results of serological tests, including aPL, ANA, ANCA, and complements C3 and C4, were negative. Workups of proinflammatory biomarkers, such as CRP, hs-CRP, and IL-6, were all negative. LPOP was 200 mmH2O, and a slightly elevated level of protein (57 mg/dl, normal range 15.0\u201345.0 mg/dl) and WBC count in CSF was found (5 \u00d7 106/L). Serum NSE was more than two times higher than the normal upper limit (36.59 ng/ml, normal range 0.0\u201317.0 ng/ml). MRI indicated cerebral infarction in the left occipital lobe () and both sides of the cerebellum (). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed focal stenosis in the distal branches of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and a partial filling defect in both sides of the superior cerebellar arteries (). CE-MRV excluded the possibility of CVT (). As this patient has not been identified to have any vascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity or smoking history, family history of small vessel disease, or state of hypercoagulability, and the evidence of systemic autoimmune diseases was also negative, we assumed that the cerebral atrial infarction was caused by emboli from cardiac source or thrombosis in situ secondary to certain unknown injuries. Then, to further evaluate the potential cause of stroke, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was conducted, with negative findings of atrial septal abnormalities [patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal defect (ASD), or atrial septal aneurysm (ASA)]. Based on the patient's medical history of using CsA, the direct or indirect adverse effect of CsA may contribute to the damage in arterial vessel walls, which further initiated the formation of thrombosis in situ. The usage of CsA was withdrawn after consultation with the department of hematology due to his relatively well-controlled condition of AA. Aspirin (100 mg, qd) was prescribed at discharge.\\nMRI follow-up at 6 months post-stroke showed no new-onset parenchymal lesions, and his symptoms were partially relieved and evaluated by PGIC scale (PGIC score = 6).", "age": "[[34.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15946232': 1, '20402748': 1, '18728028': 1, '15814551': 1, '18669426': 1, '11266687': 1, '21142409': 1, '24943080': 1, '16006763': 1, '23969472': 1, '23781355': 2, '2913802': 1, '20062656': 2, '21445949': 1, '15146282': 1, '20882667': 1, '16804111': 1, '22629100': 2, '5321209': 1, '4056835': 1, '10746592': 1, '15206553': 1, '2461180': 1, '7772676': 1, '25810861': 2, '21042505': 2, '5435665': 1, '20473075': 1, '22019667': 1, '20121554': 1, '3304591': 1, '23389501': 1, '18000622': 1, '20467181': 1, '3332724': 1, '19344364': 1, '9390592': 1, '23252806': 1, '2354899': 1, '29141931': 2, '17405075': 1, '15247983': 1, '34397153': 1, '29095327': 1, '7159062': 1, '20739823': 1, '2859508': 1, '17975805': 1, '19877796': 1, '24046068': 1, '20054716': 1, '3882763': 1, '17572443': 1, '15146156': 1, '34867719': 1, '26272383': 1, '18680243': 1, '8880713': 1, '17443678': 1, '15256794': 1, '8105031': 1, '24803635': 1, '26802867': 1, '25343068': 1, '30075547': 2, '7539270': 1, '24349404': 1, '22127914': 1, '2219218': 1, '5046932': 1, '31415348': 2, '15814548': 1, '3704532': 1, '7817365': 1, '10746588': 1, '22313896': 1, '23619106': 1, '19168026': 1, '30148022': 1, '1865677': 1, '20500972': 1, '22087834': 1, '23935354': 1, '29961388': 1, '10668740': 1, '4191549': 1, '21945504': 1, '30413453': 1, '20380729': 1, '3554656': 1, '10191492': 1, '2354344': 1, '2307418': 1, '10681086': 1, '22924641': 1, '29782786': 1, '17163271': 1, '11784361': 1, '18671192': 1, '20221962': 1, '7726612': 1, '25355613': 1, '28502943': 1, '15814547': 1, '9513380': 1, '17006323': 1, '11907423': 1, '3893178': 1, '2257701': 1, '2865466': 1, '25981579': 1, '23843405': 1, '20587216': 1, '15579201': 2, '20630373': 1, '26059883': 1, '33643175': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7906016-1': 2, '2964787-1': 1, '2964787-2': 1, '6081151-1': 1, '5695460-1': 1, '4373050-1': 1, '3356966-1': 1, '539263-1': 1, '3679692-1': 1, '2803936-1': 1, '6831267-1': 1}"}
