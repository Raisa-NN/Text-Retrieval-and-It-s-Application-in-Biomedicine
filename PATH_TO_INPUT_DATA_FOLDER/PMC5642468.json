When he was 9 months old, he developed cervical lymph node enlargement and persistent fever. Histopathologically, a cervical lymph node showed changes diagnostic for RDD ( and ). Although lymphadenopathy resolved with a course of oral prednisolone (PSL), several recurrences required additional courses. One of these, at 4 years of age, was accompanied by mild proteinuria and hematuria; PSL therapy abolished lymphadenopathy and urinary abnormalities. After PSL was discontinued at the age of 5 years, renal disease became evident at 7 years.\\nNo family history of autoimmune renal disease could be obtained. No cervical lymph nodes or other peripheral nodes were enlarged. Oliguria, ascites, and edema were absent. Physical finding upon admission included height, 115 cm (\u20131.3 SD); weight, 22 kg (\u20130.5 SD); blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; pulse, 80/min; temperature, 37 \u00b0C; respiratory rate, 20/min.\\nCreatinine clearance was normal (120.5 mL/min/1.73 m2) with no abnormal findings. Peripheral white cell count including the rate of eosinophil cells was normal. Most laboratory blood examinations, include electrolytes, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen. Aspartate aminotransferase was 18 IU/L; (normal range, 14 \u2013 20), and alanine aminotransferase activities was 23 IU/L; (normal range, 10 \u2013 40). Lactate dehydrogenase activity and creatinine kinase activity were normal. Serologic analysis for antinuclear antibody and MPO-ANCA were negative. Serum complement component C3 was 101 mg/dL; (normal range, 82 \u2013 145); C4, 18 mg/dL (normal range, 12 \u2013 33); and total complement activity (CH50) was 45.4 U/mL (normal range, 24.2 \u2013 52.8). Circulating immune complexes (CIC) were 1.5 mg/mL (normal range, below 3.0). Serum IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE concentrations were normal. An infectious work-up came back negative for hepatitis B and C. Serum interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) was elevated (89 pg/mL; normal range, < 10), as was soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R; 1,705 U/mL; normal range, 122 \u2013 496). Serum interleukin-2 (IL-2) was < 8 U/mL (normal range; < 8); interleukin-4 (IL-4), 5.7 U/mL (normal range; < 6) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), 1.3 U/mL (normal range; < 4). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) was 2.1 pg/mL (normal range; < 2.8).\\nMild to moderate proteinuria (0.5 g/day) was noted as was hematuria. Ultrasonographically renal size and shape were normal, and mass lesions were absent. Histologic examination of a renal biopsy specimen disclosed moderate mesangial proliferation, focal thickening of glomerular capillary walls, and mesangial interposition (). Mononuclear cells infiltrated the interstitium; plasma cell infiltration was absent in both glomerular and interstitial areas. Interstitial fibrosis, atrophy or other injury of tubular cells, and necrosis all were absent. Immunofluorescence showed intense IgG, C3, and C4 reactivity in portions of the mesangium and glomerular capillary walls () but no reactivity for IgA and IgM or other complement components such as C1q. Electron microscopy disclosed nodular deposits in mesangial, endocapillary, and subepithelial areas (). Immunoreactivity for S-100 protein, CD68, and lysozyme was present within the interstitium. CD30 and CD1a reactivity was absent (). Taken together, these findings confirmed a diagnosis of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\\nTreatment was initiated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy (30 mg/kg/day, 3 day/week \u00d7 2 weeks), followed by oral PSL (2 mg/kg/day); mizoribine (7 mg/kg/day); an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; and warfarin. Urinary findings gradually improved, with remission 4 months after treatment was initiated. After tapering of PSL, low-dose PSL and other drugs were continued. A second renal biopsy was performed after 1 year. Histologic examination disclosed mild mesangial proliferation, without focal thickening of glomerular capillary walls. Mononuclear cell infiltration was absent, although slight focal fibrosis was present within the interstitium. PSL and mizoribine were discontinued 2 years after initiation of therapy; only the ACE inhibitor was continued on the basis of an antiproteinuric effect and reduction of glomerular pressure. The patient remains in complete remission with no lymph node enlargement.", "age": "[[7.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11835335': 1, '16548916': 1, '16358239': 1, '15738872': 1, '11570913': 1, '21426892': 1, '11385902': 1, '7319486': 1, '33032570': 2, '17890248': 1, '12953038': 1, '18422731': 1, '14750117': 1, '5782438': 1, '19351372': 1, '10471758': 1, '16736423': 1, '2180012': 1, '15663638': 1, '16389988': 1, '29043148': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7545564-1': 1}"}
