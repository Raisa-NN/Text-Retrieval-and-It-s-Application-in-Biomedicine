A semicircular rectal tumor was seen just above the dentate line. Biopsies demonstrated that it was an amelanotic malignant melanoma since protein S100, melanoma antigen HMB45, and Melan-A expression were found. MRI revealed circumferential thickening due to rectal lesion with a 7.2 cm length and 1.8 cm thickness, leading to narrowing of the rectal lumen located 3.2 cm away from the anus and several enlarged perirectal nodes (). No distant lesions were detected upon computed tomography scan. An abdominoperineal resection was performed because a substantial part of the internal anal sphincter was invaded (). Histology (, , ) confirmed a malignant metastatic, epithelioid melanoma in 13 of the 14 examined lymph nodes.\\nThe patient recovered well from the operation, was released on the 6th postoperative day, and was referred to an oncologist. Thirty days postoperatively, the individual presented with abdominal pelvic ganglionar and pulmonary and hepatic metastases, progressed to bilateral urethral obstruction due to neoplasic invasion, and died of renal failure.", "age": "[[76.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17058735': 1, '19241934': 1, '9005147': 1, '25502089': 1, '18050846': 1, '18602790': 1, '7851168': 1, '18098086': 1, '17468984': 1, '26617919': 1, '30455915': 2, '12938606': 1, '15820458': 1, '16687086': 1, '20305438': 1, '21120314': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6230641-1': 1, '6230641-2': 1}"}
