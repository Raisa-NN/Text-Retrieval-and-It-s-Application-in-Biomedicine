Her hemoglobin, the number of white blood cells and platelets were normal. Urine and hepatic function tests were also normal. MRI of the abdomen showed a 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 cm well-defined solid mass with isointensity on T1-weighted images. The lesion demonstrated a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement on early images obtained after the administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevisth, Bayer Schering, Germany) contrast medium at a flow rate of 10 ml/15 s and became more uniformly enhanced on the portal venous phase and hepatic parenchymal phase (fig. ) on T1-weighted images. The lesion showed mild hypointensity on T2-weighted images. MRI study with biphasic infusion (2 ml/min for 10 min and 4 ml/min for 20 min) and at a dose of 15 mmol Fe/kg of glucose 5% ferumoxide (Endoremh, Guerbet, France) contrast agent demonstrated a splenic lesion with a decreased signal intensity on a T2-weighted half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) image which is the same intensity as liver parenchyma (fig. ). A 3-year follow-up showed no change in the dimensions or other characteristics of the lesion.", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11152776': 1, '16538580': 1, '16009818': 1, '15300921': 1, '8781106': 1, '8988207': 1, '27318740': 1, '17364201': 1, '26703176': 1, '21160206': 1, '18385564': 1, '15256634': 1, '23107785': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
