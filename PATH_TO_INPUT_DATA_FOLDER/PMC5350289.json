He had a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia. Neurological examination confirmed the left sided hemiplegia and decreased arousal. CT head showed moderate sized left medial posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) infarct with obstructive hydrocephalus. MRI confirmed the CT scan findings (, arrow). CT-angiography (CTA) demonstrated right vertebral artery dissection. His examination acutely worsened. He was intubated and required a decompressive suboccipital craniectomy. He slowly improved and eventually was extubated. He failed extubation and was reintubated. The ventilator waveform on reintubation showed an ataxic breathing pattern (, arrow). He eventually required tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25763477': 1, '26308429': 1, '19826583': 1, '22910395': 1, '28948503': 1, '11280673': 1, '27601069': 1, '24357462': 1, '28103536': 1, '33202857': 1, '20393814': 1, '12548031': 1, '28348899': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
