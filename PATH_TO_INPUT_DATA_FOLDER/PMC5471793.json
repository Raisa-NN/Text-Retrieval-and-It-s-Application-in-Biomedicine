Magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed a subcutaneous mass consistent with lipoma. The mass was surgically resected and consisted of fragments of adipose tissue, measuring 10.0 \u00d7 6.0 \u00d7 2.5 cm. It was analyzed at the Louisiana State University Department of Pathology, Shreveport, by H&E staining. The lesion consisted of univacuolated adipocytic cells with intermixed granular multivacuolated cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemical staining for S100 and Ki-67 was performed on the specimen. The adipocytic and hibernoma cells were immunoreactive for S100, while Ki-67 immunoreactivity was virtually absent (Fig. ) [, ]. Following excision of the lesion, the patient recovered fully, and at 18-month follow-up, there was no recurrence of the lesion.", "age": "[[24.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11395560': 1, '17011989': 1, '8056446': 1, '31777371': 1, '7513546': 1, '29629919': 1, '32332693': 1, '18127136': 1, '28626403': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
