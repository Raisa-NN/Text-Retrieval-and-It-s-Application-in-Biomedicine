After surgery, in March 2016, she received whole brain radiotherapy (DT = 40 Gy/20 F) with the boost dose (DT = 10 Gy/5 F) in the left temporal and parietal. Cranial MRI after radiotherapy revealed that compared with previous one, the left parietal lobe, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum lesion decreased.
