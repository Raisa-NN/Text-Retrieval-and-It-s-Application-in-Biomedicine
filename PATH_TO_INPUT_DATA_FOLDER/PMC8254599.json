She had hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in 2016 with regular chemoradiotherapy (25 radiotherapies with 2 brachytherapy). Her postoperative follow-up showed HR-HPV positive, and the ThinPrep cytologic test (TCT) result was LSIL. The pathology from CDB by another hospital implied suspicious HISL in April 2019. In July 2020, the colposcopy in our center detected a neoplasm at the right apical angle of vagina. The patient was then recommended for laser treatment in case of malignancy. During the operation, an 8-millimeter-diameter neoplasm at the right apical angle of vagina was seen (). The subsequent pathologic result of CDB presented IPEH, and the immunohistochemical result was CD31(+), CD34(+), AE1/AE3(-), and Ki-67(+, 5%) (). After reconfirmation with pathologists, we affirmed the neoplasm was a benign hemangioma, which was dispensable for extra therapy. The woman was then discharged with regular follow-up.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26492183': 1, '31777368': 1, '27617519': 1, '32282639': 1, '20695814': 1, '29550594': 1, '31859372': 1, '32671676': 1, '32897969': 1, '23642911': 1, '12754624': 1, '32874931': 1, '33233959': 2, '15993184': 1, '27157404': 1, '33188642': 1, '24125024': 1, '23210010': 2, '25580513': 1, '34234463': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7705293-1': 1, '3507062-1': 1}"}
