Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis (TLC -14,800/cu mm) with absolute neutrophilia (80%) and anemia (hemoglobin value 8.8 g/dL). Computed tomography revealed features of diffuse xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis in the left kidney with extension of inflammation to the para-renal tissues. The contralateral kidney was radiologically unremarkable. The patient was seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus and there was no previous history of intravenous drug abuse or sexual promiscuity.\\nGross examination showed diffuse cortical scarring with effacement of normal renal architecture []. Several yellowish-orange nodules were seen throughout, which also extended to the perinephric fat. Microscopic examination revealed fibrosing obliteration of most of the glomeruli with marked tubular atrophy. Interstitium revealed dense inflammatory infiltrate comprising of sheets of foamy histiocytes, some being hemosiderin laden,+, many actinomycotic colonies were seen that showed classical sun-ray appearance and stained positive with Gram's and silver methenamine stain []. On the basis of histopathology findings, a diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis with colesional actinomycosis was made.", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1642207': 1, '11515770': 1, '15270607': 1, '27942291': 2, '31804331': 2, '25878419': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6919534-1': 1, '5139767-1': 1}"}
