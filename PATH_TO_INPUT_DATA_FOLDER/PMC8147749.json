At the age of 77, he underwent current chemoradiotherapy (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, and thoracic irradiation at 60 Gy) for locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (cT4aN2M0, stage IVA) (Fig. ). He had a complete response, and no recurrence occurred after the therapy. Five years later, a pulmonary nodule developed in the previous irradiated field (Fig. ). Echo-guided needle biopsy revealed small-cell carcinoma, which was confirmed histologically and immunohistochemically (synaptophysin+, CD56+). Another small nodule on the left pleura was positive on positron emission tomography, and he was diagnosed with extended disease SCLC with a disseminated pleural lesion (cT1cN0M1a, stage IVA) (Fig. ). Combination first-line chemotherapy with CBDCA, VP-16, and atezolizumab was initiated. The therapy yielded a marginal effect, and PD was obvious after three courses. Although AMR was tried as a second-line therapy, no effect was obtained. Combination with CBDCA and CPT-11 was followed yielding no effect. He eventually died six months after the onset of SCLC.", "age": "[[81.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27370896': 2, '16368713': 1, '29520523': 1, '11830608': 1, '29409038': 1, '23008293': 1, '34094568': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8147749-1': 2, '4930592-1': 1}"}
