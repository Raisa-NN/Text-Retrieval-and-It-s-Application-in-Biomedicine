She did not have clinical signs or symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, and neurological and fundoscopic examination was normal.\\nThe MRI [] showed an 11 mm anterior third ventricular lesion at the foramen of Monro that was predominantly hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging with a hypointense focus within it, in keeping with a diagnosis of colloid cyst. The signal intensity pattern was the same on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, likely related to the highly proteinaceous nature of the cyst fluid. There was no evidence of restricted diffusion or hydrocephalus. Gadolinium-enhanced images were not performed. It was felt that the headaches were not related to the lesion and she was treated symptomatically.\\nThe patient was followed up with serial annual MRI imaging, which showed near-total regression of the lesion at 11 months [], followed by complete resolution on the MRI done at 2 years []. There was no susceptibility artifact on the gradient echo images to suggest any interval bleed. No cyst remnants were visible on the MRI scan done at 2 years after the initial diagnosis. Ventricular size remained normal. She was asymptomatic at the time of her last follow-up.", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12064159': 1, '24952223': 1, '10206164': 1, '26145826': 1, '4543624': 1, '1636378': 1, '18079347': 1, '10807239': 1, '12066904': 1, '21848442': 1, '2472473': 1, '8874552': 1, '15504569': 1, '10470808': 1, '28484531': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
