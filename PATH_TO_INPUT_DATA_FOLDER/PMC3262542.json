The itching of the scalp started 1 day after the use of a hair dye containing PPD, and hair loss symptoms developed 6 days after the use of the hair dye (). Hair loss had spread to approximately 90% of the scalp 4 months later (). Detailed anamneses revealed that the patient had started to use hair dye 5 years prior to the current presentation and had developed sprier itching of the scalp 1 to 2 days after her hair was dyed at a hair dresser's several months ago. All parameters examined during a blood test were within the normal limits. There was no history of associated dermatitis. A patch test showed a (++) reaction at 48 h and 72 h to 1% PPD in petrolatum. She was therefore diagnosed with contact dermatitis due to PPD, resulting in hair loss. The skin lesions gradually improved after starting treatment with the systemic corticosteroids. The patient has not had a recurrence for 18 months since she stopped using the hair dye in question.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'25776079': 1, '11736749': 1, '11411911': 1, '26759549': 1, '11176691': 1, '2641722': 1, '28396898': 1, '12534535': 1, '16524441': 1, '22363863': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
