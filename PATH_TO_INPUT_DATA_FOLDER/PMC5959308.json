Bowel regimens failed to relieve symptoms and prompted a return visit. His symptoms had progressed to non-bilious emesis, several episodes of non-bloody diarrheal stools, fevers, oliguria, increasing dyspnea, and poor oral intake. His social and occupational history was significant for military service in Vietnam with exposure to Agent Orange and a 50-pack year history of smoking. His physical exam was significant for rebound tenderness, right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness, and lack of jaundice. His laboratory results were significant for a white blood cell count of 23.4 K/uL (4.5 K/uL \u2013 10 K/uL), procalcitonin 19.51 ng/mL (3 ng/mL \u2013 15 ng/mL), alanine aminotransferase 86 IU/L (7 IU/L \u2013 56 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase 117 IU/L (10 IU/L \u2013 40 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL (0.1 mg/dL \u2013 1.3 mg/dL), albumin 2.9 g/dL (3.5 g/dL \u2013 5.5 g/dL), and international normalized ratio of 1.3 (0.8 \u2013 1.1) in the absence of warfarin. Serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein were within normal laboratory range suggesting that the testicular seminoma was successfully treated. Two sets of blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungi. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a 6 cm liver mass, and a computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed two hepatic lesions: 6.3 cm x 5.6 cm and 4.9 cm x 3.9 cm, respectively. Figure shows the hepatic drains interventional radiology (IR) placed to help drain the abscesses.\\nIR-guided drainage of the abscesses was complicated by abscess rupture, hypotension, and septic shock resulting in endotracheal intubation and initiation of vancomycin and meropenem. Cultures from the hepatic abscesses revealed a polymicrobial infection with Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus constellatus. Subsequently, vancomycin was discontinued and meropenem was changed to ertapenem as coverage for pseudomonas was no longer warranted. As the isolated pathogens typically colonize the oropharyngeal region, further investigations focused on the thoracic and facial regions. A transesophageal echocardiogram was unremarkable for vegetations or shunts; however, a maxillofacial CT scan (Figure ) revealed multiple maxillary teeth abscesses.\\nUnfortunately, the patient passed away due to worsening septic shock. Furthermore, because the patient\u2019s family declined autopsy, no tissue was available to confirm the source of infection.", "age": "[[69.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18992173': 2, '25197585': 2, '19841508': 1, '20696645': 1, '23599857': 2, '15551257': 1, '10987109': 1, '19888200': 1, '1734062': 1, '29796365': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3628469-1': 1, '4147201-1': 1, '2600825-1': 1}"}
