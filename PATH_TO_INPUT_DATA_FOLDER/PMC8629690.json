She denied any pruritis, pain, or bleeding. The patient tried several over-the-counter wart treatments for the growth with no response. She mentioned that it interfered with her ability to type on a computer keyboard efficiently. On physical examination, a 5 mm exophytic pink papule with a hyperkeratotic rim (Figure , B) was noted on the volar left index finger. Slight erythema directly around the growth was also seen. The clinical differential diagnosis included an acral fibrokeratoma, myofibroma, myrmecia wart, or less likely a glomus tumor.\\nA punch biopsy of the lesion was performed for histopathological analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumor was focally positive with SMA (Figure ) but was negative for CD34 (Figure ), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and S100. This was most consistent with the diagnosis of myopericytoma. About one month after the initial visit and biopsy, the patient began to notice the formation of a subcutaneous nodule, as well as recurrence of the growth that was initially removed by the punch biopsy. Complete re-excision was performed via a punch biopsy and showed a benign, well-circumscribed, unencapsulated dermal tumor composed of concentric perivascular spindle cells, still consistent with myopericytoma (Figure , D). The margins were free of the tumor cells, and the patient has not had any recurrence at the six-month follow-up.", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'4008685': 1, '16330949': 1, '25789958': 1, '18788860': 1, '27047931': 1, '29245316': 2, '16394283': 1, '18494828': 1, '9591720': 1, '34868775': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5728931-1': 1}"}
