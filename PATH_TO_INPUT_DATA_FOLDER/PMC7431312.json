These manifestations presented after he went to a city located at an altitude of 10,341 feet. On the physical exam, the patient showed splenomegaly, which was tender to palpation. In the ultrasound, there were multiple heterogeneous images within the spleen. In the CT angiogram of the abdomen, there was notable splenomegaly and lack of enhancement of the spleen compatible with splenic infarct (Figure ). The complete blood count study showed hemoglobin of 13.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 38%, leukocytes of 13.3 x 109/L, and platelets of 157 x 109/L. His total bilirubin was 4.30 mg/dL, with indirect bilirubin of 3.49 mg/dL. Looking for a thrombogenic explanation, we studied protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, factor V Leiden, and D-dimer, but they were negative. Finally, the hemoglobin electrophoresis results showed HbA of 55%, HbS of 40%, HbA2 of 3.2%, and HbF of 1.8%, giving a diagnosis of SCT. During his admission, he was treated with conservative measures, such as symptom control and hydration, until he was discharged home.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23810115': 1, '27336073': 1, '19609334': 1, '25361178': 1, '27408111': 1, '19328367': 1, '24942899': 1, '2321078': 1, '17048454': 1, '22944537': 1, '19393983': 1, '21239829': 1, '19149345': 1, '26356690': 1, '16248136': 1, '25503918': 1, '29308370': 2, '3974118': 1, '27580691': 1, '31407926': 1, '32821639': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7431312-1': 2, '5752817-1': 1}"}
