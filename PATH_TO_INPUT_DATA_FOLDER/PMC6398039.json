This was performed for chronic rhinosinusitis and left frontal mucocoele. His medical history also included significant ptosis, despite previous ophthalmological intervention. At presentation, he suffered from recurrent sinonasal disease with left-sided headache and left fronto-orbital fistula discharge over his medial canthus ().\\nMF underwent computer tomography of the orbit, sinuses, and skull base (), demonstrating the small A-P diameter of frontal sinus and extensive neo-osteogenesis from chronic frontal sinusitis. An endonasal endoscopic approach would likely be ineffective in this patient. Multidisciplinary discussion led to the option of Riedel's procedure and concurrent excision of fronto-orbital fistula under the same anaesthetic.", "age": "[[74.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'6650152': 1, '522581': 1, '11177363': 1, '10852527': 1, '7121155': 1, '11344073': 1, '15509367': 1, '30911426': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
