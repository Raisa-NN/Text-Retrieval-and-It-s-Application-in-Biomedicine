She had been maintained on emtricitabine-tenofovir, atazanavir, and ritonavir. Her other medical problems included iron deficiency anemia and mild intermittent asthma. In addition to antiretroviral therapy, her other medications included albuterol and iron supplementation. Family history was significant for HIV infection in patient\u2019s mother and oropharyngeal cancer in her aunt. No family history of liver disease or liver malignancy was reported. Social history did not reveal substance abuse. She was referred to hepatology for evaluation of splenomegaly, elevated liver tests, and thrombocytopenia. On initial evaluation, she reported easy bruising and gingival oozing. Physical exam revealed firm and enlarged spleen 10 cm below the costal margin with mild tenderness and without associated hepatomegaly. Initial laboratory results showed albumin of 3.9 g/dL, total protein of 7.7 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level of 11 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and glomerular filtration rate of >60 mL/min. Alkaline phosphatase was 260 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 80 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase 83 U/L. Platelet count was 72 000/\u00b5L. International normalized ratio was 1.2. Other laboratory results showed iron deficiency anemia with hemoglobin of 9.6 g/\u00b5L. CD4 count was >300, and viral load was undetectable. Hepatitis B and C serology testing was unrevealing. Antinuclear and anti\u2013smooth muscle antibodies were not detected.\\nInitial computed tomography scan of abdomen and pelvis at that time showed splenomegaly measuring 18.3 cm \u00d7 10.9 cm on coronal series and large collateral vessels suggestive of portal hypertension without associated cirrhosis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was significant for large esophageal varices without high-risk stigmata. Liver biopsy showed minimal fibrosis around the portal areas with no significant inflammation. The lobules showed focal zones of thin hepatocyte plates on reticulin stain with adjacent areas showing mild regenerative changes ( and ). The diagnosis of NRH was made and patient was placed on propranolol 10 mg twice a day. Two years after the diagnosis of NRH, the patient presented with hematemesis without hemodynamic instability and was found to have active gastric variceal bleeding. Consequently, she underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Portal pressure gradient decreased from 36 mm Hg to 13 mm Hg. Postprocedure course was complicated by mild encephalopathy controlled with lactulose.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging performed for pre-TIPS evaluation of the portal vasculature showed a 7-mm hypervascular nodular focus in segment IVa. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging performed 4 months post-TIPS placement showed stable lesion suspicious for early HCC; however, 6 months later it showed an increase in nodule size to 1.7 cm \u00d7 1.3 cm, consistent with HCC (-, courtesy of Dr. Victoria Cherniak, Bronx, NY). Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) score was 4, which refers to hyperenhancement on the imaging arterial phase, a finding that is consistent with probable HCC. Alpha-fetoprotein level was 1.9 IU/mL. The case was comprehensively discussed in our transplant selection multidisciplinary meeting and was deemed to be a candidate for liver transplantation. The patient expressed interest in liver transplantation and was placed on the transplant waiting list with MELD score of 11. Since the lesion was LI-RADS 4, the recommended approach is that there is no need for biopsy and to monitor the lesion radiologically. Three months later, the patient decided to have the intrauterine device removed due to bleeding, and she opted not to have other forms of contraception provided. She is currently pregnant and has been following with maternal-fetal medicine specialist. Relisting for liver transplantation is pending antepartum and postpartum clinical course. In the meantime, her HCC has been monitored with serial imaging without further intervention given its size of less than 2 cm.", "age": "[[26.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21601542': 1, '20299955': 1, '24653794': 1, '8385167': 1, '34514900': 2, '8633575': 1, '18668652': 1, '16688096': 1, '23607291': 1, '21472097': 1, '25473149': 1, '9840149': 1, '10915724': 1, '15054815': 1, '8594428': 1, '21056493': 1, '2189821': 1, '28491877': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8436301-1': 1, '8436301-2': 1}"}
