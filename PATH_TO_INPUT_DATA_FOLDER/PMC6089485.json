These symptoms started on the day prior to the admission and were preceded by high-grade fever. The vitals were normal. Cardiac examination was normal. The electrocardiogram showed diffuse repolarisation changes. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed impaired systolic function of the left ventricle with ejection fraction 48%. Cardiac enzymes - creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatine phosphokinase myocardial band fraction (CPK-MB), and troponin T were all markedly elevated. The blood lipid tests were within reference ranges. The initial differential diagnosis included acute myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and myocarditis. CT of the chest with contrast matter showed no signs of aortic dissection. A peculiar finding was noted in the right lung and was recognized as an azygos vein passing through the upper lobe and separating an azygos lobe with its mesoazygos (Figures -).\\nThe patient was evaluated through coronary angiography which did not show any evidence of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction. Finally, microbiological tests were conducted and revealed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which was discussed as the cause of acute myocarditis. The patient was treated accordingly and returned to normal activity within a few days.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16333920': 1, '25624609': 1, '23403771': 1, '32664403': 1, '22033832': 1, '2643832': 1, '31802263': 1, '28713683': 1, '34401270': 2, '34086104': 1, '16363719': 1, '28546719': 1, '30112256': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8348907-1': 1}"}
