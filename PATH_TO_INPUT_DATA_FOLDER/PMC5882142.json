The constricting band extended from the lesser omentum (hepatogastric ligament) to the greater omentum. This fat laden band was 6 cm in length and 1.4 cm in width at its widest point and 5 mm at its narrowest point. There was no history of abdominal surgery or trauma to the abdomen. The cause of death was heart failure. Further dissection of the abdominal cavity found no other gross pathology or anatomical variations. Mild distension of the pylorus could be seen.", "age": "[[87.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16121875': 1, '22472391': 1, '20559662': 1, '16177429': 1, '22428770': 1, '19756654': 1, '8337878': 1, '17233053': 1, '18438286': 1, '29632757': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
