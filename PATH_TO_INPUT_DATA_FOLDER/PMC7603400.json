Endoscopic ultrasonography () arose suspicion of GIST and computed tomography scan () revealed an exophytic lesion with 97 \u00d7 77 \u00d7 57 mm rising from the gastric greater curvature, with no signs of metastatic or locally advanced disease.\\nConsidering the tumour\u2019s location and the presence of grade 2 obesity with cardiovascular risk factors, a multidisciplinary group meeting proposed laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and informed consent was obtained. Both peri and postoperative periods were uneventful, patient was discharged after 5 days.\\nInspection of surgical specimen () showed an intramural, nodular, solid mass measuring 85 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 60mm with unremarkable overlaying mucosa; a cut section revealed a yellowish homogeneous tumour. Histological examination () revealed a well-delimited, but not capsulated mass, centred at muscularis propria, surrounded by peripheral lymphoid aggregates. Spindle cells with palisading nuclei, arranged in a fascicular pattern, slight pleomorphic, rare mitosis (1/30 high-power field) and no necrosis characterized this tumour. Resection margins were negative for tumour cells. Additionally, immunohistochemistry of tumour cells showed strongly positive nuclear staining for S-100 () and SOX10, consistent with the diagnosis of benign schwannoma.\\nAfter 6 months of surgery the patient had no gastrointestinal complaints and showed an excess weight loss (EWL) of 53.5% with a BMI of 31.43 kg/m2. Furthermore, a reduction in the need of chronic medication was achieved, with optimal blood pressure profile under antihypertensive monotherapy and sustained normal range cholesterol and triglycerides values without administration of targeted therapy ( and ). An EWL of 90.2% was noted 24 months after the surgery, translating into a thankful patient living an active life with a BMI of 26.35 kg/m2.", "age": "[[73.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26641646': 1, '12528772': 1, '29389237': 1, '22907486': 1, '19460678': 1, '10199472': 1, '26093765': 1, '30928107': 1, '24135948': 1, '11005253': 1, '33154810': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
