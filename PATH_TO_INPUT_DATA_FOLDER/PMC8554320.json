Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a large, soft tissue mass of 12.43 \u00d7 10.22 cm in the right middle lobe and a massive right pleural effusion (). Abdominal CT showed liver hypodensity with a nodule measuring 2.83 \u00d7 2.76 cm (). Local hypodensity shadow of the kidney was present on both sides, with a mass of 4.53 \u00d7 4.26 cm in the left kidney and 4.16 \u00d7 3.36 cm in the right kidney (). A CT-guided tumor biopsy was then performed, and the tumor was pathologically diagnosed as SCLC (extensive-stage, stage IV, ) with immunoreactivity to CD56, Synaptophysin (Syn), CgA and Ki-67 (about 90% positive), and negative for TTF-1 and p40 on (\u2013). In addition, laboratory examinations revealed elevations in the levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE; 179 ng/mL), whereas no abnormalities were observed in carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). He was treated with chemotherapy (etoposide plus lobaplatin) two cycles. On October 9, 2020, the patient showed a progressive disease with lung lesion (from 12.43 \u00d7 10.22 cm to 15.00 \u00d7 12.6 cm), liver nodule (from 2.83 \u00d7 2.76 cm to 4.16 \u00d7 3.36 cm), left kidney lesion (from 4.53 \u00d7 4.26 cm to 8.06 \u00d7 6.8 cm), and right kidney lesion (from 4.16 \u00d7 3.36 cm to 6.26 \u00d7 4.52 cm). Meanwhile, the levels of NSE (\u02c3300 ng/mL), CA19-9 (24.8 U/mL) and CEA (2.13 ng/mL) were increased ( and ).\\nTo seek potential therapeutic regimens, the blood specimen was subjected to NGS analysis, and a novel ALK and intergenic region (IR) rearrangement was identified (mutant allele frequency [MAF]: 19.21%, and ). Immunohistochemical staining (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) showed an increased signal of ALK expression (). Alectinib (600 mg BID) combined with irinotecan (CPT-11; 0.4g dl) as second-line therapy was administered. After two cycles of treatment, CT scan showed a partial response (PR) with a reduction from 15.0 \u00d7 12.6 cm to 8.42 \u00d7 5.16 cm for lung lesion (). Meanwhile, the size of liver tumor (2.0 \u00d7 1.57 cm) and bilateral kidney tumor (left: 3.3 \u00d7 2.37 cm; right: 3.05 \u00d7 2.18 cm) were decreased (). NGS-based ctDNA test showed a decrease in MAF of ALK rearrangement (from 19.21% to 0.58%, ). During the 4th, 6th and 8th cycles after treatment, the tumor lesions continued to decrease, and the patient maintained PR ( and ). In addition, ALK rearrangement had disappeared after 4 cycles of treatment (). There were no obvious adverse reactions to the treatment. It suggests that the patient has a durable response to Alectinib and achieved 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) until the report date of this case.", "age": "[[26.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31794921': 1, '23787064': 1, '24981975': 1, '23154565': 1, '11784874': 1, '32093858': 1, '17579629': 1, '29173772': 1, '32418886': 1, '20104223': 1, '30207593': 1, '34729013': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
