The pathological findings were as follows: well-differentiated NEN, tumor size 12 mm, no muscular invasion (submucosa), negative resection margins, positive vascular invasion, chromogranin positivity, synaptophysin positivity, and Ki-67 = 1.7%. He visited a nearby hospital complaining of right epigastric pain 13 years after the EMR. It was diagnosed as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and pancreatitis. CT on admission showed multiple liver masses (Fig. d). A liver biopsy revealed multiple liver metastases derived from S6 (47 mm). He received daily oral everolimus 10 mg and has maintained SD for 3 years and 3 months since the diagnosis of liver metastases.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23083227': 1, '24519035': 1, '20087092': 1, '25936647': 1, '15714250': 1, '28448665': 1, '15742328': 1, '24462168': 1, '26730835': 1, '23591432': 1, '18490556': 1, '17213340': 1, '19214898': 1, '31940115': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6962411-1': 2, '6962411-2': 2}"}
