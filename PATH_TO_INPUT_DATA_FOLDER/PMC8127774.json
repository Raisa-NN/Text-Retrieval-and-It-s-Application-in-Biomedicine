Trans-rectal prostatic ultrasonography indicated a markedly enlarged prostate, while digital rectal examination demonstrated an enlarged prostate with unusual consistency on palpation. The serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration was 1.2 \u00b5g/L, and the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration, as well as other laboratory values, were within the normal ranges. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the prostatic mass measured 9.5 \u00d7 4.8 \u00d7 9.5 cm3, presented as mixed hypointense T1 signals and hyperintense T2 signals, and compressed the bladder, seminal vesicle, and rectum.\\nThere was no evidence of rectal infiltration (), and no enlarged pelvic lymph nodes were detected. Whole-body bone scan (multi-probe) and chest roentgenography identified no metastases, and abdominal plain computed tomography (CT) showed no abnormalities. Thus, a primary prostatic mass was preliminarily diagnosed. To further investigate the pathological nature of the mass, trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy was subsequently performed, and post-operative pathology revealed that spindle-dominant tumor cells proliferated and showed mild cytological atypia. There were no typical areas of coagulative neoplastic necrosis, and low mitotic counts (<5 per 50 high-power fields) were observed (). Immunohistochemical stains for cluster of differentiation (CD)117, CD34, DOG1, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and H3K27Me3 were diffusely positive, and staining for desmin (DES), S100, anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (PCK), caldesmon, and SOX10 was negative (). The imaging evidence and histological results indicated a diagnosis of primary prostatic EGIST. To obtain more information for treatment planning and to further confirm the EGIST diagnosis, gene mutation examination revealed missense mutation in ARID1A exon 3 and deletion mutation in c-kit exon 11, indicating expected prolonged survival benefit with imatinib therapy. The patient received targeted imatinib therapy (400 mg, daily) and was followed for 6 months. The tumor volume decreased to 1.5 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 1.3 cm3 (examined in a local hospital), and the patient experienced no metastasis or recurrence. For personal reasons, the patient refused radical prostatectomy.", "age": "[[62.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18381383': 1, '32703220': 2, '20457867': 1, '30152251': 2, '22069172': 1, '24817976': 1, '25684950': 1, '34759530': 1, '17760761': 1, '24932260': 2, '28418346': 2, '29166334': 1, '16996377': 1, '24137192': 2, '25606568': 2, '24416692': 1, '20716168': 1, '29220298': 1, '15708062': 1, '31920343': 2, '21274753': 1, '27034816': 1, '26402134': 1, '12094370': 1, '9438854': 1, '15087667': 1, '29599305': 1, '29777611': 1, '10824931': 1, '11705489': 1, '33983064': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4298822-1': 1, '5394300-1': 1, '7379776-1': 1, '4049718-1': 1, '6166354-1': 1, '3786811-1': 1, '6941604-1': 1}"}
