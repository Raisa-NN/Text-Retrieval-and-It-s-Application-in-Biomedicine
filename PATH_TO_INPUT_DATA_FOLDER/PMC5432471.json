Her past medical history was not significant; the patient had a history of chronic abdominal pain for two years. On pelvic examination, the uterus was normal in size. There was no tenderness in either adnexal region. Tumor markers were as follows, cancer antigen (CA) 125; 10.4 U/mL, CA 19-9; 2 U/mL. An ultrasonography examination was suggested the presence of 5.0 \u00d7 2.7 cm sized echogenic cyst in left ovary. A computed tomography (CT) scan was carried out and demonstrated a cystic mass measuring 5.7 \u00d7 3.1 cm at left ovary (). Laparoscopy was performed. Smooth, yellowish white mass was noted in the left adnexal region (). There was no ligamentous or direct connection with the pelvic organs, including the uterus, and there was no apparent blood supply to the tumor. The left ovary and tube were not found. The uterus and the right adnexa appeared normal. The mass was removed safely with blunt dissection. Histological examination revealed a typical MCT with adipose tissue and hair root sheaths. The cyst wall consisted of collagen fibers with marked infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes with calcification, which indicated ischemic and inflammatory changes (). These findings were consistent with a MCT within an autoamputated ovary.", "age": "[[34.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21904862': 1, '19176224': 1, '18971145': 1, '30671413': 1, '13238472': 1, '26793683': 2, '1538369': 1, '34184850': 2, '17578369': 1, '4684211': 1, '9846719': 1, '28523263': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8291982-1': 1, '4719092-1': 1, '4719092-2': 1}"}
