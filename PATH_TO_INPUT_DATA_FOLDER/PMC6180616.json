His background history was significant for atrial fibrillation, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and left thoracotomy for lung cancer resection.\\nTwo weeks prior to admission, he presented to a urology clinic for evaluation of micropenis and was incidentally noted to have microhematuria on urinalysis. He underwent a negative cystoscopy. He proceeded to have a computerized tomography (CT) scan that revealed a left perinephric mass with enlarged peri-renal and para-aortic lymph nodes, as well as retroperitoneal streaky changes (Fig. ). Due to concern for malignancy, he underwent a CT-guided peri-renal lesion biopsy. Initial histopathological analysis revealed extensive areas of atypical cellular proliferation with no clear pathological diagnosis. The patient elected surveillance rather than surgical exploration.\\nTwo weeks later, the patient required hospital admission for increasing abdominal pain. Physical exam revealed an elderly gentleman with tachycardia of 102 beats/min. The abdomen was distended and tender throughout with a positive fluid wave, without rebound tenderness or guarding. Biopsy site appeared clean without evidence of a hematoma. Laboratory investigations revealed a leukocytosis. The remaining hematological, biochemical and coagulation profiles were normal.\\nWith new evidence of ascites, an ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed and extracted 6 L of bloody fluid. Repeat CT imaging revealed concern for urine extravasation. Fluid analysis, however, was not consistent with urinary ascites. Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was <1.1 g/dL. Another paracentesis 3 days later extracted 8 L of fluid, again noted to be bloody. Cytology was repeatedly negative for malignant cells.\\nUrology was consulted and the patient underwent a retrograde pyelogram which verified extravasation at the proximal ureter. A left ureteral stent and subsequently a left nephrostomy tube for urinary diversion.\\nThe patient recovered rapidly and was discharged home, only to be readmitted one day later after a syncopal event. He developed painful abdominal distention from ascites requiring frequent paracenteses that withdrew 23 L of hemorrhagic ascites over 11 days.\\nSurgical Oncology was consulted for a malignancy workup. Tumor markers including AFP, CEA and CA 19-9 were negative. A diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purplish discoloration and thickening of omentum with inflammatory reaction on the parietal peritoneum (Fig. ). The small bowel appeared viable without evidence of enteric leakage. A biopsy of the omentum was performed. Frozen section analysis was interpreted as containing atypical cellular proliferation with extensive areas of necrosis. Twelve liters of bloody peritoneal fluid were aspirated.\\nThe patient developed a systemic inflammatory response post-operatively, and required intensive care unit admission. Two days later, the patient returned to the OR for exploratory laparotomy and omentectomy for treatment of continued sepsis and ongoing tissue necrosis. Inspection of the peritoneal cavity revealed a normal liver, gallbladder and pancreas. The small bowel showed evidence of serositis without necrosis. The greater omentum was grossly necrotic with widespread areas of purplish discoloration and was resected. Further inspection of the retroperitoneum revealed a peri-renal mass involving Gerota\u2019s fascia of the lower lobe of the left kidney. The kidney itself appeared normal. Approximately 9 L of bloody ascites fluid were aspirated.\\nThe final histopathology results of the omentum revealed high-grade angiosarcoma (Fig. ). Due to his multiple co-morbidities, the patient was not a candidate for palliative chemotherapy. His clinical status continued to decline and he died 7 days post-operatively.", "age": "[[69.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'3417231': 1, '3763072': 1, '17013893': 1, '8635113': 1, '15015593': 1, '10352907': 1, '30323919': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
