This muscle originated from the anteromedial surface of the quadratus lumborum and ran distally to fuse with the tendon of the psoas major at the level of the inguinal ligament. The FN on this side was formed by the ventral rami of the L2 to L4 at the level of L4 and bifurcated into four separate branches at the level of L5. The most medial branch descended posterior to the psoas quartus muscle and innervated the iliacus. The second and third branches were split by the variant muscle over 101.9 mm, reunited laterally to the variant muscle and then passed below the inguinal ligament. The most lateral branch ran downward and anterior to the variant muscle, independently passed beneath the inguinal ligament without reunion, and innervated the skin on the lateral aspect of the thigh together with the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. The FN had direct branches that supplied the iliacus, psoas major, and psoas quartus muscles. No other musculoskeletal variants were observed in the area dissected and no signs of previous surgical intervention were found.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18299090': 1, '20140146': 1, '4330969': 1, '29021927': 1, '17231810': 1, '8915621': 1, '16130828': 1, '29577432': 1, '28321940': 1, '16583380': 1, '16506239': 1, '15796359': 1, '33536351': 2, '14595220': 1, '31338239': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8017448-1': 1}"}
