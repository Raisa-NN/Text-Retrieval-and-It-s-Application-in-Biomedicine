He had undergone left lower lobe endobronchial coil insertion 6 months prior. Computed tomography scanning revealed perforation of the lung parenchyma and mediastinal pleura by an endobronchial coil (), with its tip penetrating the pericardium and abutting myocardium. Trans-thoracic echocardiography demonstrated a sub-centimetre pericardial collection along the inferior cardiac wall without cardiac tamponade.\\nVia a single 4 cm incision for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) (), the embedded endobronchial coil was carefully manipulated out of the superficial lung parenchyma and epicardial fat, and wedge resection of the damaged lung performed. There was no penetrating cardiac injury. The patient made an uneventful recovery.", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29574418': 1, '33133493': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
