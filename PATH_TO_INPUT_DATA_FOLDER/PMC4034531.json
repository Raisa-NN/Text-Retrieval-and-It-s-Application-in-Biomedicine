Her pain was unusual such that it was constant in nature, rated as 8/10 in her right upper quadrant and there was no clinical improvement over 24 hours. An abdominal ultrasound scan was performed, which reported small mobile gallstones, a distended thick walled gallbladder with surrounding pericholecystic fluid and a dilated common bile duct. There was no impacted stone seen in the cystic duct or Hartmann's pouch. Hence a request for CT was made and again it confirmed no calculous obstruction. The patient was managed with intravenous antibiotics initially but had worsening pain, fever to 38.6\u00b0C, white cell count of 14 \u00d7 109/L and a C-reactive protein of 81 before a decision was made to proceed to emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy the following day. Intra-operatively we discovered a dusky gallbladder with gangrenous patches and torsion of the gallbladder with 270 degrees clockwise rotation along the longitudinal axis (Figures and ). Histology confirmed gallbladder haemorrhage, necrosis and mucosal sloughing, consistent with ischaemia. Post-operatively we reviewed the CT again with the radiologist and a 3-dimensional volume reconstruction was requested. In retrospect it was clearly evident that there was a transition point at the neck of the gallbladder and torsion.", "age": "[[80.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17860545': 1, '30018034': 1, '22185300': 2, '20529542': 1, '15757065': 1, '9396527': 1, '18294374': 2, '24949212': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3259112-1': 1, '2266718-1': 1}"}
