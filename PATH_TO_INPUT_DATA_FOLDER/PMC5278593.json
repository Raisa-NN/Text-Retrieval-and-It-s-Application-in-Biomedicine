Her preoperative hemoglobin was 12.4 g%, serum Na 138 mmol/L, and Cl 102 mmol/L. An evening before surgery TGI was started with NS and total volume used was 7.5 L over a period of 10 h. On the morning of surgery, the child was lethargic and not communicating. She vomited once in the preanesthetic room. Her ABG showed pH 7.11, PaO2 93.5 mmHg, PaCO2 33.6 mmHg, HCO3 11.0 mmHg/L, BE 16.4, Na 132 mmol/L, K 3.2 mmol/L, and Cl 115 mmol/L. An IV infusion of 5% dextrose in water with 50% of the calculated NaHCO3 was started. The child started showing improvement, became active and started communicating. The ABG after NaHCO3 infusion showed pH 7.36, Na 135 mmol/L, K 3.6 mmol/L, HCO3 20 and BE 5.", "age": "[[6.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12793889': 1, '7380204': 1, '16507145': 1, '14752676': 1, '11574338': 1, '7297209': 1, '9357915': 1, '4124525': 1, '10319771': 1, '29344509': 1, '7120000': 1, '28197054': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5278593-1': 2}"}
