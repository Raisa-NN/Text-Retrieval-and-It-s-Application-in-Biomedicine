She had a history of repeated abdominal pain from about 6 months before admission but without menarche. On physical examination the thin abdomen was significantly distended and mildly tendered, more severe on the lower abdomen and the secondary sexual characteristics were present. All Routine laboratory examinations in the emergency room were in normal ranges. Abdominal and pelvis ultrasonography reported urinary retention, mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, mild dilatation of the uterus, significant dilatation and elongation of the vagina and suggested hematocolpos. The patient refused physical examination of the vagina even by a female nurse. Using the experiences of the first case, she was taken to the operating room and under general anesthesia, the examination revealed the typical shape of imperforate hymen. A Foley catheter was inserted and the hymenotomy was done similar to case 1. 3 months follow up visits revealed normal renal function tests, normal sonography and uneventful mensrtuation. She refused physical examination of the treated hymen in follow up visits.", "age": "[[13.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19960149': 1, '23145439': 1, '17949378': 1, '24693516': 1, '19646660': 1, '17673137': 1, '23841042': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
