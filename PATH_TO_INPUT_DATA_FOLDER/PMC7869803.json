Clinical examination revealed that tooth #13 had erupted at\\nthe site of the missing tooth #12, and that the eruption of tooth #53 was delayed\\nand distal to tooth #13. The patient had microdontia of tooth #22, and tooth #85 had\\nnot erupted yet (Figs 1, 2). He had a Class I skeletal pattern (ANB =\\n4o), a mesocephalic pattern, a balanced vertical growth pattern (SN.GoGn\\n= 32o, y-axis = 52o, FMA = 21o), a well-positioned\\nmaxilla and a retrognathic mandible (SNA = 81o and SNB = 77o).\\nHe also had an edge-to-edge molar relationship, which tended to an Angle Class II\\nocclusion, and positive space discrepancy in the maxillary arch (6.5 mm). Overbite\\nand overjet were increased (4.67 mm and 8 mm), maxillary dental midline was deviated\\n3.5 mm to the right, and there were diastemas between maxillary anterior teeth.\\nMaxillary incisors were proclined (1.NA = 35o, 1-NA = 5 mm) and\\nmandibular incisors were slightly crowded and proclined (1.NB = 27o, 1-NB\\n= 6mm) (, Fig 3). He had a straight\\nprofile and an upper lip short to the S-line (Steiner), a right mentolabial angle\\nand an obtuse nasolabial angle. The analysis of function revealed atypical phonation\\nand deglutition, as well as tongue thrust.\\nTreatment objectives were leveling and alignment of dental arches, adequate overbite\\nand overjet, coinciding dental and facial midlines, molar and canine Class I\\nrelationship, reshaping of tooth #22 and space opening for implant at the site of\\nthe missing tooth #12.", "age": "[[14.0, 'year'], [2.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'28401166': 1, '28457262': 1, '21911843': 1, '32215476': 2, '12658298': 1, '28457277': 1, '27894526': 1, '25726407': 1, '15151692': 1, '10825866': 1, '29969831': 1, '21803241': 1, '20152659': 1, '20685523': 1, '30304157': 2, '12887578': 1, '4515779': 1, '9622764': 1, '268147': 1, '31721951': 1, '29157542': 1, '10672217': 1, '23603338': 1, '21457853': 1, '16905057': 1, '33503127': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7077940-1': 1, '6150707-1': 1}"}
