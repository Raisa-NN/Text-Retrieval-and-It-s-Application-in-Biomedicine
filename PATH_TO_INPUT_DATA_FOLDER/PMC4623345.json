She was born at term weighing 3,250 g by uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery. Motor and language development showed normal development. In physical examination, her height was 106.1 cm (<3rd percentile) and weight was 17.5 kg (5th-10th percentile). Furthermore, body mass index (BMI) was 15.55 kg/m2 (25th-50th percentile). She showed mesomelic disproportion of limbs. Her father's and mother's height was 165 cm and 154 cm respectively. Her father showed similar features but did not take a special examination for diagnosis. Laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin, 12.6 g/dL; white blood cell count, 9,350/\u00b5L; platelet, 301,000/\u00b5L; aspartate transaminase, 33 IU/L; alanine transaminase, 17 IU/L; T3, 175.9 ng/dL; free T4, 1.54 ng/dL; thyroid-stimulating hormone, 1.23 \u00b5IU/mL; insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, 95.36 ng/mL; and IGF-BP3, 1,902.41 ng/mL. Therefore, laboratory findings showed normal results. Her hand radiograph showed Madelung deformity. Bone age determined by the Greulich-Pyle method was 5 years 9 months at the chronological age of 7 years 2 months (). Except for mesomelic short stature and Madelung deformity, she did not show other physical abnormalities.\\nChromosome analysis revealed the normal female karyotype 46,XX. To determine the cause of short stature, the patient was admitted on April 28th, 2015. Her height and weight were 108.9 cm (<3rd percentile) and 19.7 kg (5th-10th percentile), respectively. Over the six-month monitoring period, her growth velocity was 5.6 cm/yr. BMI was 16.6 kg/m2 (50th-75th percentile). Arm span, height of trunk, leg length, sitting height, and upper segment/lower segment ratio were 100.5 cm, 58 cm, 50.9 cm, 62.5 cm, and 1.13 (normal, 1.2), respectively.\\nExtremities to trunk ratio was 2.42 (normal, 2.49). For evaluation of growth hormone secretion function, a growth hormone stimulation test was done and showed a normal response.\\nTherefore, growth hormone secretion was normal. Because the patient showed mesomelic short stature, normal female karyotype, Madelung deformity, and low extremities to trunk ratio, she was suspected of having SHOX deficiency. Accordingly, we performed mutation analysis of the SHOX gene and found a c.491G>A (p.W164X) mutation (). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with LWD due to a SHOX gene mutation.", "age": "[[7.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18782877': 1, '25110390': 1, '15118270': 1, '19926713': 1, '16807223': 1, '12116254': 1, '22518848': 1, '15356038': 1, '17047016': 1, '9590293': 1, '9590292': 1, '10749976': 1, '17182655': 1, '32582486': 2, '17201812': 1, '14557470': 1, '11889216': 1, '21325865': 1, '10878753': 1, '9140395': 1, '26512353': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7306668-1': 1}"}
