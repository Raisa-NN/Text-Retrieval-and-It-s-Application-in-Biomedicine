Dermatological evaluation revealed bullae and crusted erosions over the forehead spreading toward the chest, abdomen, and ventral aspects of thighs. He responded poorly to dapsone (100 mg/day), azathioprine (100 mg/day), and prednisolone (20 mg/day) for 10 weeks. In view of large areas of erosions with significant pain, he was hospitalized and was started on intravenous (IV) dexamethasone 8 mg once daily, tablet cyclophosphamide 50 mg once daily, and IV immunoglobulin 2 g/kg of total dose for 5 days. Meanwhile, he developed significant dysphoria, pessimistic ideas, death wishes, and fear against two unknown persons that he could see in their absence. Detailed psychiatric evaluation revealed depressed mood, easy fatigability, and crying spells with Lilliputian hallucinations of seeing two small individuals (size of 2 feet) threatening to kill him. On mental status examination (MSE), an interesting phenomenon noted was the evolution of tiny Lilliputian hallucinations into gigantic Brobdingnagian hallucinations (size of 10 feet) on treatment with steroids. The description of the visuals could not fit dysmegalopsia or visual imagery. There was nothing suggestive of delirium or seizures. Neurological and ophthalmic evaluation was normal. His routine blood investigations and computed tomography of the brain were within the normal limits. A diagnosis of organic depression with psychotic symptoms was made by consultation\u2013liaison psychiatry team and started on oral escitalopram up to 20 mg and risperidone up to 4 mg/day. Within a week of treatment, the size of hallucinations reduced back to tiny people (from 10 feet to 2 feet) while preserving the shape of them and completely resolved by the end of 2 weeks. His depression improved at the time of discharge backed by MSE and drop in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores from 18 to 6.", "age": "[[44.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'28942756': 1, '21517800': 1, '27845416': 1, '8039694': 1, '33165350': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
