At the time her nadir CD4+ T cell count was 186 cells/\u03bcl with an HIV RNA viral load of 5 \u00b7 28 log. An MRI showed left frontotemporal white matter lesions (Fig. ). CSF was qualitatively positive for JCV DNA by PCR. No quantitative test was performed. She improved significantly on a stable regimen of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz. Her HIV RNA was below detection on all subsequent testing.\\nMRI in 2012 showed significant atrophy (predominantly left frontoparietal) and new non-enhancing T2 hyperintensities in the middle cerebellar peduncles, splenium and periventricular region (Fig. ), mainly involving white matter, but also grey-white matter junction.\\nCSF was positive for JCV DNA at 2786 copies/ml and negative for HIV RNA. She had a detectable immune response to JCV mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Although her CD4+ T cell count was 676 cells/\u03bcl and HIV RNA undetectable, her medications were changed to abacavir, emtricitabine, etravirine, raltegravir, and maraviroc to optimise brain penetration. The right frontal region was biopsied. Mirtazapine was trialled to no avail, and she deteriorated and died seven months after the biopsy.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9531012': 1, '23092189': 1, '20818792': 1, '22157619': 1, '21131916': 1, '24088807': 1, '16862584': 1, '19129505': 1, '12769183': 1, '28989857': 1, '19828476': 1, '30273245': 1, '2876640': 1, '33219338': 1, '27455335': 1, '26727910': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4925684-1': 2}"}
