Her previous medical history was unremarkable except for several mild head traumas. No MRI scan were obtained at that time. From the age of 30, the patient showed rapid cognitive decline, postural tremor, sporadic myoclonic jerks in the lower limbs, and transient facial dyskinesias. Her vision was preserved. Brain MRI showed cerebral atrophy, mainly in the parieto-occipital regions, cerebellar atrophy and T2-weighted hyperintensities in the periventricular areas (Fig. ).\\nA 45-year-old woman (case 2), a cousin of case 1, had experienced tonic-clonic seizures since the age of 21, controlled by sodium valproate (1000 mg/day), phenobarbital (100 mg/day) and zonesamide (200 mg/day). In her 30s, the patient developed cognitive impairment, ideomotor apraxia, cerebellar dysarthria and inappropriate laughter. Her sight was spared. Brain MRI, carried out when the neurological signs were noted, showed cortico-subcortical atrophy, periventricular white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted scans, cerebellar atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum (Fig. ).\\nBoth patients belonged to the largest family with KD type B reported to date in which a homozygous c.213+1G>C mutation in CTSF was detected [].", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16455164': 1, '32855186': 1, '24082928': 2, '23200925': 1, '25274848': 1, '24088765': 1, '25359263': 1, '21820099': 1, '8576553': 1, '19015486': 1, '22568672': 1, '21549341': 1, '23297359': 1, '22520356': 1, '24029190': 1, '24779634': 1, '26141065': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3783717-1': 1, '3783717-2': 1, '3783717-3': 1}"}
