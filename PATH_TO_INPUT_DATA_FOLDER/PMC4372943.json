In his medical history, he had been diagnosed with tuberculosis 23 years ago and had been treated with anti-tuberculosis therapy. He smoked 40 packets-years. There were no fever, weight loss, and night sweats. His physical examination revealed multiple cutaneous lesions on the skin of the face, limbs, neck, scalp, dorsal side, fingers, subungual side, right leg, and feet. The lesions were painless, fragile, dark purple colored, measuring 1-3 cm, arising from the subcutaneous tissue, and with a tendency to bleed, one of them caused distal finger auto-necrosis []. His complete blood count and serum biochemistry was unremarkable. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 51 mm/h (\u2191), C-reactive protein: 105 mg/L (\u2191), lactate dehydrogenase: 212 IU/L (\u2191), carcinoembryogenic antigen: 3.69 ng/ml, (N), anti-microsomal antibody: 220.54 IU/ml (\u2191) (N < 5.61), and anti-thyroglobulin antibody: 29,25 IU/ml (\u2191), (N < 4.11). Necrotic and nodular skin lesions were thought to be symptomatic of vasculitis. Rheumatologist evaluated the patient and clinical and laboratory findings of the patient were not consistent with vasculitis. A punch biopsy from the skin lesion was performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a cutaneous metastasis, probably from squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Biopsy material was immunohistologically negative for surfactant and TTF-1, and positive for P 63. On thorax computerized tomography (CT), a left hilar mass with 5.5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 6 cm dimensions was detected. He was diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer after bronchoscopic biopsy. Staging work-up including abdominal CT and Tc-99m bone scan revealed liver and bone metastasis. The patient received palliative radiotherapy to the metastatic bones. Then, he was treated with combination chemotherapy regimen consisted of docetaxel (75 mg/m2/day for every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2/day for every 3 weeks) with support granulocyte stimulating factor. After 3 chemotherapy courses, his skin lesions tended to disappear with scar tissue []. But his liver metastasis progressed and a new lesion on surrenal gland was detected. Therefore, a second-line chemotherapy protocol was given 6 courses, but only partial response was obtained. The patient died 10 months after the initial diagnosis due to disease progression.", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12630642': 1, '8835596': 1, '11115569': 1, '18462410': 1, '7622642': 1, '31320871': 2, '7528933': 1, '31616555': 2, '20735519': 1, '2155089': 1, '8552539': 1, '32850155': 2, '30288050': 2, '3815293': 1, '7956399': 1, '25814739': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7441430-1': 1, '6160265-1': 1, '6616052-1': 1, '6616052-2': 1, '6786133-1': 1}"}
