Her medical history was significant for a two-year history of fibroids, which contributed to mild menorrhagia. Within 30 minutes of arrival, the patient developed signs of shock with a blood pressure of 89/67 mmHg, heart rate of 115 beats per minute, and a drop in serial hemoglobin measurements from 8.4 g/dL to 6.8 g/dL. Point-of-care ultrasound showed a large amount of free fluid in the abdomen associated with a large abdominal mass originating in the pelvis. Emergent computed tomography (CT) imaging demonstrated a large amount of intra-peritoneal bleeding associated with massive fibroids as shown in \u2013. Exploratory laparotomy discovered 3L of hemoperitoneum as well as a roughly 30-week-sized uterus with multiple fibroids, two of which were torsed and actively bleeding. The patient received four units of packed red blood cells, underwent emergent supracervical hysterectomy without additional complications, and was eventually discharged on post-operative day 3. Surgical pathology demonstrated normal endocervical and endometrial tissue, as well as multiple intramural and subserosal leiomyomas measuring up to 17.8 cm in length.", "age": "[[34.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18926384': 1, '25951730': 1, '16305710': 1, '32292614': 1, '31326857': 2, '16129236': 1, '29849383': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6642253-1': 1}"}
