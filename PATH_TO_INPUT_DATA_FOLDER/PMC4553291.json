At the time of the accident, the initially attending surgeon did not treat her surgically, due to severe polytrauma with liver laceration. The patient reported severe buttock pain and leg-length discrepancy. Radiographs showed posterior and superior migration of the right hemipelvis and nonunion of the left anterior pelvis. A CT image showed nonunion through the right sacrum and the left pubic rami, with displacement. We planned a three-stage pelvic reconstruction. During the first stage, we reconstructed her pelvis through the left pubic release. Then, we turned the patient into the prone position and osteotomized her sacrum. Reduction was performed by using a Matta clamp, and fixation was performed using a posterior tension band with a locking compression plate because of disuse osteoporosis. Finally, we rolled her into the supine position and then reopened the lower abdominal incision. The left superior rami was then fixed with a plate. During the operation, the patient was transfused with 18 packs of blood. Radiographs obtained immediately after surgery showed correction of the deformity, and radiographs obtained 14 months later during a follow-up examination showed maintenance of the reduction ().", "age": "[[44.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'34522754': 1, '29049196': 1, '3726125': 1, '10615965': 1, '8769452': 1, '28681229': 1, '34790599': 2, '31016218': 1, '6998633': 1, '29951273': 1, '31050213': 1, '9659475': 1, '12585573': 1, '19184260': 1, '26330965': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4553291-1': 2, '4553291-2': 2, '4553291-3': 2, '8576784-1': 1}"}
