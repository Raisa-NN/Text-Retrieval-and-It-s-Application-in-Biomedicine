Genomic analysis of a pleural effusion specimen revealed the presence of double uncommon EGFR mutations (G719X in exon 18 and L861Q in exon 21). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 24-mm nodule in the lower left lobe of the lung and left pleural effusion. Treatment with afatinib was initiated at 40 mg daily. After 1 month, a CT scan showed a prominent reduction in the size of the nodule in the lower left lobe and the disappearance of left pleural effusion (Figure A, B). The patient's serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) had decreased from 162.6 to 7.3 ng/mL at 5 months after the onset of afatinib treatment (Figure C). At the time of writing of this report, the patient had continued to receive afatinib without dose reduction for 10 months and showed sustained tumor shrinkage.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34008923': 1, '21132006': 1, '33145037': 1, '32565965': 1, '27240419': 1, '26785607': 1, '27323238': 1, '26051236': 1, '23387505': 1, '17877814': 1, '28088511': 1, '32354946': 1, '30255614': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
