One hour later, the patient was admitted to the emergency unit. The finger was amputated at the proximal interphalangeal joint level, with 0.8 cm of skin tissue attached. The distal amputated finger lacked a blood supply and had a joint defect. The length of the phalanx defect was about 3 cm, while the area of the skin defect was 4 cm \u00d7 2 cm [Figure and ]. A composite tissue flap with the proximal interphalangeal joint taken from the second toe was used to repair the injured finger []. The donor toe was amputated. The replanted finger and transplanted joint both survived after the operation []. The patient was followed up for 2 years. The appearance of the repaired finger was good, and it could achieve digital opposition with the thumb. The range of flexion motion for the proximal interphalangeal joint was up to 70\u00b0 [Figure and ].", "age": "[[23.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11304612': 1, '26001429': 1, '20728286': 1, '21549523': 1, '25819289': 1, '18443507': 1, '1705134': 1, '19430241': 1, '26763268': 1, '17462311': 1, '19598314': 1, '21124145': 1, '20012069': 1, '1244600': 1, '20404757': 1, '21712137': 1, '23948445': 1, '17418669': 1, '19347801': 1, '18242608': 1, '25255109': 1, '21572379': 1, '26424981': 1, '26404796': 1, '22512940': 1, '19340522': 1, '25191156': 1, '24306700': 1, '1474643': 1, '26512296': 2, '33023628': 1, '17049349': 1, '25934206': 1, '26327788': 1, '30967709': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6415561-1': 2, '4624359-1': 1, '4624359-2': 1, '4624359-3': 1}"}
