He was noted to have raised white cell count and platelets on routine monitoring of his chronic disorders which included hypertension, ischemic heart disease, haemochromatosis, and intracranial aneurysm. A full blood count showed a white cell count 33.5 \u00d7 109/L, haemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, and platelets of 762 \u00d7 109/L. The white cell differential was comprised of neutrophils 19.8 \u00d7 109/L, myelocytes 2.0 \u00d7 109/L, metamyelocytes 2.0 \u00d7 109/L, lymphocytes 5.0 \u00d7 109/L, monocytes 1.3 \u00d7 109/L, eosinophils 0.3 \u00d7 109/L, and basophils 2.4 \u00d7 109/L. A bone marrow aspirate was hypercellular with significant myeloid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia with reduced erythroid series and no fibrosis evident. Cytogenetic analysis revealed 45,X,-Y,t(9; 22)(q34; q11.2) in 20/20 metaphases. A standard reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology for detection of BCR-ABL1 transcripts [] showed a single band that upon sequencing demonstrated an e19a2 BCRABL1 fusion leading to a diagnosis of chronic phase CML. The patient commenced on hydroxycarbamide 1 g/day then imatinib 400 mg od one week later. He achieved haematological remission within three months, but thrombocytopenia became rapidly evident prompting an increase in imatinib to 800 mg od. Again, his blood counts normalized, but this was not sustained. Peripheral blood quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed as previously described [] at four months and demonstrated no significant decrease in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels (). This prompted investigation for an ABL1 KD mutation []. Sequencing of the ABL1 KD revealed a Q252H mutation (). As ABL1 KD mutation bearing clones may exist in a minority of CML patients at presentation [], retrospective analysis was performed but did not demonstrate the presence of the Q252H at presentation. The patient was switched to nilotinib 300 mg bd. At seven months he was deteriorating clinically with increasing splenomegaly and myeloblasts seen in the peripheral blood (white cell count 71.5 \u00d7 109/L, basophils 8.6 \u00d7 109/L, and myeloblasts 15.0 \u00d7 109/L) indicating myeloid blast crisis. A further fragmented bone marrow biopsy demonstrated hypercellularity secondary to increased blast cell numbers () with grade II fibrosis (). As the presence of a concurrent myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) could have been responsible for the bone marrow fibrosis [], the most common MPN-associated mutations were retrospectively sought in presentation DNA using an allele-specific PCR approach []. No evidence was found of the JAK2 V617F, MPL W515L, or W515 K mutations. The patient commenced nilotinib 300 mg bd with a negligible decrease in BCR-ABL1 transcripts over the following three months period (). He continued to deteriorate clinically, and his final admission was with pyelonephritis due to renal stones. He became increasingly cachectic with worsening splenomegaly and wished to be at home where he died with the cause of death being CML complicated by ischemic heart disease.", "age": "[[78.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10602411': 1, '14562117': 1, '23320000': 1, '20592475': 1, '12100156': 1, '19075254': 1, '20702476': 1, '33416167': 1, '17412419': 1, '21641037': 1, '20417871': 1, '20447687': 1, '16304378': 1, '8839830': 1, '16772610': 1, '15241831': 1, '11756197': 1, '19282833': 1, '17021137': 1, '2224129': 1, '15284852': 1, '20008852': 1, '20938171': 1, '17805334': 1, '22653972': 1, '20682399': 1, '23289634': 1, '21562040': 1, '12783380': 1, '21940831': 1, '17530620': 1, '15705718': 1, '15930265': 1, '15338554': 1, '12623848': 1, '17656262': 1, '24109527': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
