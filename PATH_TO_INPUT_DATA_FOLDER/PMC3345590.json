He had pharmacoresistant epileptic encephelopathy and did not qualify for elective epilepsy surgery. He was submitted to two replacements of the pulse generator in 2002 (in an other institution) and finally in 2008 in our center. Few months after the second pulse generator replacement, the patient developed a serious problem in the healing of surgical scar that caused a breakage of the leads of the electrode. Because of the optimal seizure control resulted from VNS treatment, with more than 50% decrease in frequency and number of seizures, we decided to replace VNS with a new system. Therefore, he was submitted to complete removal of the VNS system (pulse generator, leads and electrodes) and to an ex novo implant procedure []. The removal of the helical electrode was performed with the aid of an operating microscope; dense scar and fibrosis that linked electrodes to left vagal nerve were peeled out by microscissor and the electrodes and the silicone spiral tether were cut and piecemeal removed [Figure and ]. The lack of gross changes of the vagus nerve observed after electrode removal was impressive []. When new VNS electrodes were placed cranial to the site of the removed electrodes [], an excellent nerve\u2013electrode interface was achieved, with impedances comparable to those achieved during implantation in naive subjects.", "age": "[[47.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20121370': 1, '9848840': 1, '10713198': 1, '11301092': 1, '12959437': 1, '12849332': 1, '15168224': 1, '26335753': 1, '10369236': 1, '11701002': 1, '16518639': 1, '19119910': 1, '22566727': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
