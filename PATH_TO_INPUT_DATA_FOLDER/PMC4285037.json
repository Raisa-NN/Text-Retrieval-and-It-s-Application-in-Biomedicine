In 2005, he had been admitted to the Department of Endocrinology because of cold sweating, facial flushing, and uncontrolled blood pressure. A ~7 cm right adrenal mass had been observed on computed tomography (CT) and there had been no distant metastasis on an MIBG scan. The patient had undergone laparoscopic right adrenalectomy due to PCC. After surgery, he had been followed up in the outpatient clinic until 2007. During that period, there was no evidence of metastasis in abdominal CT. The patient had also been treated for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for 3 years and had a history of coronary stent insertion for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in March 2012. At admission to the Department of Gastroenterology, he experienced dizziness, diaphoresis, general weakness, and poor oral intake; his blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg and his heart rate was 78 bpm. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. They revealed a ~10 cm hepatic mass in the right lobe of the liver that had a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and early arterial enhancement and delayed washout on dynamic contrast-enhanced images. Also, it had a low signal intensity on the hepatobiliary phase and high cellularity on the diffusion phase (). The hepatic mass was considered to be hepatocellular carcinoma rather than malignant PCC. For these reasons, liver biopsy was performed to evaluate the incidental hepatic mass. The patient was given the \u03b1-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine to prevent a hypertensive crisis before biopsy because we could not completely rule out the possibility of metastatic PCC. However, during and after the liver biopsy, his vital signs were stable. PCC was finally confirmed on the basis of morphological and immunohistochemical findings, with the specimens staining positive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin. Laboratory tests revealed the following serum metabolite levels on the day of admission: aspartate aminotransferase, 29 IU/L (normal, 10 to 40); alanine aminotransferase, 24 IU/L (normal, 6 to 40); alkaline phosphatase, 97 IU/L (normal, 40 to 129); total bilirubin, 0.42 mg/dL (normal, 0.1 to 1.2); direct bilirubin, 0.16 mg/dL (normal, 0.09 to 0.30); and \u03b3-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), 150 IU/L (normal, 11 to 73). These levels, obtained by performing a liver function test, were all in the normal ranges, except for the mild elevation of GGT. Hepatitis virus markers were negative and tumor markers for hepatocellular carcinoma (\u03b1-fetoprotein and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II) were in the normal ranges. Furthermore, at admission we measured the patient's serum/urine levels of catecholamines, which were as follows: serum epinephrine, 0.078 pg/mL (normal, <50); serum norepinephrine, 1.473 pg/mL (normal, 110 to 410); serum metanephrine, 2.47 nmol/L (normal, <0.5); serum normetanephrine, 44.97 nmol/L (normal, <0.5); 24-hour urine epinephrine, 43.8 \u00b5g (normal, 0 to 20 \u00b5g/day); 24-hour urine norepinephrine, 339 \u00b5g (normal, 12.1 to 85.5 \u00b5g/day); 24-hour urine metanephrine, 35.931 mg (normal, 0.0 to 1.3 mg/day); and 24-hour urine vanillylmandelic acid, 120 mg (normal, 1.20 to 6.52 mg/day). The total urine volume collected in one day was 1,900 mL, and contained 1,171.16 mg of creatinine. The serum and 24-hour urine catecholamine levels were high. An 131I-MIBG scan revealed increased uptake of 131I-MIBG in the right adrenal gland bed and adjacent liver parenchyma (). Surgical resection was impossible because the tumor had invaded the portal vein and the adjacent lymph nodes. Therefore, we planned radionuclide therapy. However, the isolated ward needed for that was not available for at least 6 weeks. Finally, TACE was performed for the liver metastasis. Celiac angiography showed a large mass in the right lobe of the liver. An emulsion of 10 mL of lipiodol and 50 mg of doxorubicin (an anticancer drug) was injected (). The tumor was well lipiodolized, as observed by post-TACE imaging ().\\nBefore the procedure, the patient continued to receive phenoxybenzamine. After TACE, he was transferred to the intensive care unit for 6 days for management of a hypertensive crisis and postembolization syndrome. His high blood pressure and tachycardia were strictly controlled by infusion of nitroprusside, nifedipine, and labetalol (). Abdominal CT was performed 2 weeks after TACE. Although the size of the metastatic hepatic mass had not decreased, it showed lipiodol uptake (). However, follow-up abdominal CT 7 months after TACE showed that the diameter of the hepatic mass had decreased from 10 to 8.3 cm (). Although the response was that of stable disease on the basis of modified RECIST criteria, the tumor seemed to have responded to TACE because of its decreased size. The patient's symptoms at admission, including dizziness and diaphoresis, improved substantially. The serum catecholamine levels were followed up 2 months after TACE and were as follows: serum epinephrine, 0.091 pg/mL; serum norepinephrine, 0.842 pg/mL; serum metanephrine, 4.26 nmol/L; and serum normetanephrine, 22.27 nmol/L. The serum norepinephrine and normetanephrine levels had decreased significantly (). The patient continues to be followed up and has shown no significant problems.", "age": "[[69.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20371953': 1, '6453259': 1, '25827457': 1, '11213051': 1, '23588637': 1, '24636619': 1, '29731900': 1, '17284633': 1, '23730992': 1, '24570195': 1, '23576482': 1, '24520430': 1, '22328163': 1, '26404320': 1, '24636754': 1, '25325276': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
