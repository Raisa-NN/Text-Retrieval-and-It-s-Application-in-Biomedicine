Physical examination was remarkable for a right ventricular heave, fixed splitting of the second heart sound and an ejection murmur in the pulmonary area. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed a large 25 mm secundum atrial septal defect associated with right ventricular volume overload. Given these findings, it was decided to attempt percutaneous occlusion of the defect under transoesophageal echocardiographic and fluoroscopic guidance.", "age": "[[15.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29588310': 1, '23265438': 1, '17275715': 1, '16950474': 1, '29232303': 1, '26693326': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
