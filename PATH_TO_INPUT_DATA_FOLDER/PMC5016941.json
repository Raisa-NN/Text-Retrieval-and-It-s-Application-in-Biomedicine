The patient had no medical history. Physical examination revealed hypoesthesia of the upper limbs, evidence of bilateral lower extremity weakness with motor power 4/5 in distal muscular group, and hypoactive reflexes in four extremities. There was no bowel or bladder dysfunction.\\nCervical CT-scan and MR imaging demonstrated the presence of a 75 \u00d7 36 \u00d7 24 mm extradural mass, with extra-spinal extension at the left C1\u2013C6 level (Fig. ). This dumbbell-shaped mass had heterogeneous signal intensity, calcifications and homogeneous intermediate post-contrast enhancement following gadolinium administration.\\nNo other cord lesion and no osseous abnormality of the spine were found. A biopsy was done. Microscopic sections showed a highly cellular neoplasm composed of diffuse sheets of tumor cells having monomorphic, round to oval, finely vesicular nuclei, occasional nucleoli, and scanty cytoplasm. Large areas of necrosis were seen (Fig. ). Immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for CD99 (Fig. ) and S-100 protein, and negativity for synaptophysin, chromogranin, desmin, myogenin and CD56; favoring the diagnosis of PNET. After six courses of chemotherapy, cervical CT scan demonstrated complete regression of the mass. Our patient has remained in remission at 8 months follow-up.", "age": "[[5.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30005673': 1, '29145292': 1, '11960157': 1, '17316801': 1, '11146604': 1, '18759606': 1, '29245277': 1, '17190980': 1, '15340820': 1, '11531770': 1, '30595962': 2, '22575593': 1, '31168222': 1, '11290502': 1, '22629492': 2, '23050205': 2, '20591597': 1, '21194274': 1, '1374853': 1, '17786790': 1, '10908947': 1, '17330591': 1, '11666019': 1, '21414790': 1, '24100059': 1, '27613377': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6287338-1': 1, '3356992-1': 1, '3463148-1': 1}"}
