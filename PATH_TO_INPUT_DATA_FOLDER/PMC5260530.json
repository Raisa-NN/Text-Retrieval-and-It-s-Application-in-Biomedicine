After the routine ocular examination, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence, and a discussion about the surgery, fitting/procedures, and the possible benefits and complications of the method, the patient underwent implantation of the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System in his left eye, typically the worse-seeing eye, on June 27, 2016. Two weeks before the implantation surgery, phacoemulsification without intraocular lens implantation was performed. An endoscope-assisted and controlled regular surgical procedure was performed without any complications. He is currently undergoing his first rehabilitation session, and he can follow patterns of light on the floor.\\nIn both cases, during the fitting procedure, we used complete active electrodes with the proper impedance measurement and perfect placement of the arrays. So far, there have not been any complications, such as a retinal tear, hypotony, ciliary body detachment, or tacking issues.", "age": "[[31.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26162233': 1, '23285287': 1, '29546474': 1, '23544203': 1, '26386850': 1, '22661464': 1, '24403565': 1, '23426738': 1, '25675964': 1, '31245978': 1, '21854602': 1, '31486609': 1, '31236288': 1, '28203188': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5260530-1': 2}"}
