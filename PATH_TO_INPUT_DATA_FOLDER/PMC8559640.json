He was admitted to a local hospital due to myopathy and pneumonia with serum CPK level raised up to 1820 IU/lit. Afterward, he was referred to a specialized center and admitted to the rheumatology department. Bilateral pulmonary consolidations in the bases of two lungs were observed regarding coronavirus involvement.\\nO2 saturation was 92%, and serum CPK was still elevated, and the patient was transferred to ICU. 30 days after disease onset, electrodiagnostic tests were performed. The results showed an acute and ongoing myogenic process in all upper and lower limbs muscles which was suggestive of active polymyositis. Prednisolone 60 mg daily, hydroxychloroquine 200mg, IVIG 25 gr for 5 days were prescribed to him associated to other antibiotics and drugs.
