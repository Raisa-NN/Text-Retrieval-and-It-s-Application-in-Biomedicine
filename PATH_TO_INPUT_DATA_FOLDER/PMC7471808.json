She was treated as mucosal candidiasis for more than 3 years without any result. There were no other family members affected by similar lesions. The lesions were asymptomatic except of some episodic burning sensations when eating acid or spicy food.\\nCutaneous examination showed white irregular plaques with well-defined borders and symmetric distribution on the buccal mucosa (). There was no associated erythema, and the plaques did not scrape off when using a tongue blade. There were no similar lesions elsewhere on the other mucosae. Histopathological examination showed superficial parakeratosis, acanthosis, and spongiosis with perinuclear eosinophilic condensation of epithelial cells. A minimal lymphocytic infiltration was present in the stroma. PAS coloration was negative. These features were characteristic of oral white sponge nevus. The genetic study was not performed.\\nBecause of the benign and asymptomatic nature of the lesions, no medication was performed and the fungal treatment was stopped.", "age": "[[6.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15067267': 1, '21561439': 1, '14600690': 1, '10652003': 1, '27601826': 2, '659700': 1, '29034652': 1, '32908720': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4989564-1': 1}"}
