Endoscopic indication of mucosal damage at the entrance of the pharynx and esophagus was observed, but no fish bone was found in the stomach or esophagus.

She had facies dolorosa, but the color of whole body skin and mucous membrane was normal. Rales were not heard in bilateral lungs. No extra or abnormal heart sound, murmurs, or pericardium friction sound was noted. The abdomen was flat and soft, and there was no marked pitting edema in lower extremities.\\nRoutine blood, urine, stool, coagulation, and blood biochemistry tests were all normal.\\nGastroscopic examination suggested that the upper esophageal segment exhibited a strip-shaped submucous bulge of approximately 8 mm \u00d7 40 mm (Figure ). CT suggested that the upper esophageal segment contained a high-density band in the right wall, with a diameter of approximately 35 mm (Figure ). Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed that the upper submucosa of the esophagus exhibited a striped hyperechoic mass, with a rear weak echo, and the muscularis propria was involved (Figure ).", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'34778309': 2, '29953004': 1, '31183357': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8585761-1': 1, '8585761-2': 1}"}
