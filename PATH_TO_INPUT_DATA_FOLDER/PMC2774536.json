Prior to her visit, the patient had an excision of the soft tissue mass in a different facility but without any histopathological analysis. Patient did have a recurrence of the soft tissue mass and eventually presented to our institution four years after the original surgery. Plain foot radiographs were obtained and revealed cortical irregularities of the third and fifth metatarsals suggesting possible occurrence of the local soft tissue invasion (). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the existence of a soft tissue mass arising in the dorsal-to-plantar side of the left foot and partially invading into the bone cortex. On T1 and T2 weighted images, the signal intensities of the soft tissue mass were found to be significantly high and, after administration of a contrast medium, peripheral enhancement was observed (). After an open biopsy, the mass was diagnosed as a well-differentiated liposarcoma (). Marginal resection of the tumor along with a ray amputation including the fourth metatarsal and the cortices of the third and the fifth metatarsal bones, was performed. At five years postoperatively, the patient is able to ambulate without any assistance or discomfort. Her ISOLS scale was estimated to be 100% in accordance with the Enneking's criteria [] and no local recurrence has been detected at her last visit.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'5503596': 1, '12091667': 1, '5932909': 1, '8425352': 1, '29492589': 1, '690396': 1, '9060596': 1, '14368246': 1, '15830579': 1, '6297235': 1, '19902014': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
