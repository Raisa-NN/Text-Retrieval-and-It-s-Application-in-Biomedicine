She had undergone excision of type I choledochal cyst and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy 2 years earlier at an outside hospital (). CT scan and magnetic resonance cholangiography showed right intrahepatic duct stone with biliary dilatation (). PTBD was performed and the stenotic sites were dilated. Intrahepatic stones were removed through percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (). PTBD and balloon dilatation were repeated 8 times over 9 years. Finally, she was referred for surgery, but she was very reluctant to undergo another surgery. We explained the wait-and-see strategy after PVE and right PVE was performed (). After PVE, the right liver progressively shrank (). Three months after PVE, we decided to wait for a longer period until further atrophy of the right liver. Twelve months after PVE, we decided to perform regular follow-ups with imaging studies unless cholangitis developed again. The patient has done well for 14 months after PVE without any episode of cholangitis.", "age": "[[51.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23219349': 1, '17581468': 1, '8554422': 1, '26304608': 1, '26421038': 2, '19890603': 1, '27384172': 1, '22469733': 1, '17219273': 1, '19300228': 1, '32843602': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7452811-1': 2, '4582538-1': 1}"}
