The blood sample was taken after receiving written informed consent from her parents. No pubic or axillary hair was seen by physical examination, and she had no clinical symptoms of Turner syndrome with 46, XX karyotype. In the sonographic survey, uterus was infantile. She was hypertensive (150/90 mmHg, 50th percentile for age) with high gonadotropins levels (LH, 19 mU/mL; FSH, 34 mU/mL). Moreover, low peripheral concentrations of sex steroids were seen (Table I).\\nGenomic DNA was purified from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) using QIAGEN Mini Blood kit. All the exons of CYP17A1 genewere proliferated by PCR (primers listed in Table II), which were designed with Primer3 software (). All the PCR products were sequenced in both directions by sanger sequencing.\\nAs shown in Figure 1, a new in-frame homozygous deletion c.1052-1054CCT in exon 6 was identified that reported for the first time. 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency was first pronounced by Biglieri and colleagues (15), who was phenotypically female and presented with sexual infantilism, primary amenorrhea and hypertension.", "age": "[[14.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'2026124': 1, '34070975': 1, '34290232': 1, '3488328': 1, '25765894': 1, '9360545': 1, '14504283': 1, '21051590': 1, '4288776': 1, '11344930': 1, '3500022': 1, '3025870': 1, '11848730': 1, '12466376': 1, '9326943': 1, '22266943': 1, '17223983': 1, '18559916': 1, '16569739': 1, '20080843': 1, '22170708': 1, '22841373': 1, '31508570': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
