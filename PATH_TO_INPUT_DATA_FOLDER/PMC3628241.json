There was no prior history of trauma or surgery. They were soft, compressible and non pulsatile. The larger swelling was in the upper part of anterior triangle of right side of neck and smaller one in the lateral aspect of right supraclavicular region measuring approximately 3 \u00d7 2 cm and 2 \u00d7 1 cm respectively. The swellings enlarged on valsalva maneuver []. A provisional diagnosis of laryngocele was made for the larger swelling considering the history with the differential diagnosis of venous aneurysm and superior mediastinal mass considering their number, locations and response to valsalva. The chest radiograph was normal. Doppler ultrasound showed three well defined, compressible cystic lesions with venous flow, the largest one communicating with the internal jugular vein [] and the smaller ones with the upper part (not clinically evident) and lower part of external jugular vein. The left neck veins were normal. These findings suggested venous aneurysms of right internal and external jugular veins. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) done with 10 ml of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent revealed aneurysm of common facial vein, which drained into internal jugular vein and two aneurysms of external jugular vein [].", "age": "[[8.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27408270': 1, '19857801': 1, '32426676': 2, '21716689': 1, '29291199': 2, '31528444': 1, '31555423': 2, '648229': 1, '30496123': 1, '23599580': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6745431-1': 1, '5740185-1': 1, '7219995-1': 1}"}
