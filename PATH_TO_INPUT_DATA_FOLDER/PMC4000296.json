Neurological examination on day 5 of photophobia onset revealed dilated pupils, which were 7.5 mm in diameter, on both sides but without limitations of ocular movement, including accommodation. His distance visual acuity was normal, and his near visual acuity was not tested. Both light and accommodation reflexes were absent. The funduscopic findings were normal. He showed no limb ataxia. The tandem gait test revealed slight ataxia, but the patient's gait was almost normal. His deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and normal in the upper extremities and slightly exaggerated in the lower extremities. The plantar responses were flexor. His sensations of touch, pain, and vibration were normal. Instillation of 2% of pilocarpine caused pupillary constriction to approximately 3.0 mm. Diluted pilocarpine was not used. The pupillary response to epinephrine was not tested. Routine hematological examinations were unremarkable. The serum IgG anti-GQ1b antibody titer was not determined. Brain MRI showed no abnormalities. The patient was treated with a 3-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day), which was followed by oral prednisolone (40 mg/day). The gait ataxia disappeared within a week. The photophobia gradually improved, and the pupil size returned to normal, with normal light reflex noted on day 98.", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17584996': 1, '20093031': 1, '32395161': 1, '8437711': 1, '22149656': 1, '12532942': 1, '9443504': 1, '9818909': 1, '9279166': 1, '11118247': 1, '11257783': 1, '8413947': 1, '24803906': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4000296-1': 2}"}
