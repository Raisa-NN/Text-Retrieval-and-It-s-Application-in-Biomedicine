She denied fever, night sweats, loss of weight, chest pain, or hemoptysis. Her past history was unremarkable with no history of tuberculosis or smoking. Physical examination was normal. Clinically, electrocardiography and routine laboratory tests were normal. Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography of the chest showed 35 \u00d7 22 mm irregular cystic lesion in right lower lobe, wall thickness of 0.5 mm to 3.5 mm, smooth inner margin, septum was seen within the cyst. The lesion also showed mild distortion of surrounding lung tissue with no evidence of abnormal arterial blood supply (Fig. A\u2013C). The result of brush test showed cells with heteromorphic nucleus by bronchoscopy. Right lower lobe thoracoscopic wedge resection was done. The size of the lung tissue removed was 10.0 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm. Histopathology (Fig. ) showed cystic tumor of 4.5 \u00d7 2.0 \u00d7 1.5 cm, composed of multiple varying sized cysts lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with few areas of necrosis. All these features were consistent with the diagnosis of type 1 CPAM. On follow up 1 year later, the patient is asymptomatic.", "age": "[[66.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9730204': 1, '20736808': 1, '19061226': 1, '25883453': 1, '22997368': 1, '28073634': 1, '12677563': 1, '12376599': 1, '23231806': 1, '22498375': 1, '18753756': 1, '17527088': 1, '11316935': 1, '856714': 1, '34912138': 1, '18941042': 1, '1398534': 1, '22784387': 1, '31192965': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
