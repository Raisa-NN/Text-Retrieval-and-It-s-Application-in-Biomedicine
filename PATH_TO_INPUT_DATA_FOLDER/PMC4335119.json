While performing oral examination, the dentist came across an unusual anatomical structure located posterior to the tongue. Unaware of its significance, the dentist approached the department of Anatomy, USP for consultation. After a thorough clinical examination of the oral cavity which showed the epiglottis touching the uvula () and with the help of the literature, a diagnosis of visible epiglottis was made. Knowing the benign feature of such anatomical variant unless associated with any sort of distress, the patient and the parents were reassured of its innocuous nature and the patient was sent back after necessary dental treatment.", "age": "[[8.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'6673605': 1, '2382783': 1, '11574386': 1, '21374728': 1, '4027773': 1, '10866930': 1, '17823468': 1, '9728878': 1, '25709308': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
