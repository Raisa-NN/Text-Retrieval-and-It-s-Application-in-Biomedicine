He wished to take the intravesical BCG at his hometown. The BCG was inadvertently given intravenously elsewhere. The BCG strain and dose used were not known. He reported to the Urology OPD with high-grade fever for ten days. He also had jaundice for 5 days, left upper abdominal pain, and cough for 3 days. On examination, he had tachycardia, icterus with tender hepatosplenomegaly. His LFT was deranged. Mycobacterial workup of blood and bone marrow was negative. The histopathological examination of the bone marrow and liver showed a granuloma, which was negative for acid-fast bacilli. He was afebrile within a week of initiating anti-tubercular treatment (ATT). He was treated with HRE and pyridoxine for 9 months. The intravesical BCG was stopped and he is on surveillance cystoscopy and remains recurrence-free at 18 months\u2019 follow-up. He did not have any late sequelae at last follow-up.", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12913751': 1, '12522745': 1, '18176300': 1, '21317964': 1, '25398060': 1, '11010823': 1, '34465959': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8388352-1': 2}"}
