She was performed excisional biopsy due to suspicious fibroma. Physical examination revealed swelling and a dense lesion on the left buttock (). Rectal examination revealed that the mass was not related to the rectum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 15\u00d710\u00d76-cm irregularly shaped enhanced mass in the left perineum, extending to the left retroperitoneum via the obturator foramen (). In the lithotomy position with general anesthesia, the tumor was excised via the perineal approach (), and confirmed remaining mass via abdominal laparotomy. Histopathology of the specimen also showed capillaries and cavernous vascular spaces filled with blood, and stellate spindle cell proliferation in the interstitial tissue. Immunohistochemical staining showed positivity for CD10, smooth muscle actin, desmin, and CD34. The patient has had no recurrences 4 months after surgery and has been regularly followed-up.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20926030': 1, '30474017': 2, '18603701': 1, '19098606': 1, '23130288': 2, '27274880': 2, '28514296': 1, '16246403': 1, '9559638': 1, '15157218': 1, '9930798': 1, '28875758': 1, '20596716': 1, '23550881': 1, '17568501': 1, '18214507': 1, '21534774': 1, '10672053': 1, '26623420': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4663234-1': 2, '4663234-2': 2, '3481881-1': 1, '6236091-1': 1, '4871960-1': 1}"}
