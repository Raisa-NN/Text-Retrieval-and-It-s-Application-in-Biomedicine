The elevated AST level of 136 U/L was first noted in 2006, and other liver enzymes were within reference ranges. Subsequent measurements showed an upward trend for persistent AST elevation, as shown in Figure .\\nThe physical examination was unremarkable, and the patient had no stigmata of liver disease. A review of her laboratory data revealed disproportionately elevated AST levels. A comprehensive work-up for elevated AST including screening for hemolysis, acute and chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alpha-1 antitrypsin, ferritin levels, creatine kinase (CK), and aldolase was unrevealing.\\nAn ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a normal liver, spleen, and pancreas on two separate occasions, with one year between the scans. Liver biopsy findings were suggestive of steatohepatitis, as shown in Figure .\\nAs the tests did not reveal the cause of the unusually high AST levels, macro-AST was suspected. To confirm this, a blood sample was tested for macro-AST by the polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method. Serum AST activity before precipitation was 808 U/L, but it dropped to 24 U/L post-PEG precipitation. The results were consistent with the presence of macro-AST (i.e., 97% of the activity is precipitated with PEG), confirming our diagnosis.", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20308729': 1, '21246276': 1, '14503988': 1, '8710043': 1, '29295780': 1, '32570300': 1, '31497458': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
