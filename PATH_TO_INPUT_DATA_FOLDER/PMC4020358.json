The general physical examination was normal except for a moderate systolic heart murmur. Biochemical tests revealed elevations of alanine aminotransferase (282 IU/l) [ref 0-78 IU/l], alkaline phosphatase (1812 IU/l) [ref 0-132 IU/l] and bile acids (14.7 \u03bcmol/l) [ref 0-12 \u03bcmol/l].\\nAbdominal ultrasonography, using a high-frequency transducer (9 MHz linear probe, GE Medical LOGIQ 9, General Electric Medical Systems, Wisconsin, USA), was done with the dog in dorsal recumbency and unsedated. The liver was considered mildly enlarged with rounded margins and in all liver lobes focal rounded variably sized areas of mixed echogenicity and smaller hypoechoic areas were seen (Figure \\n). Differential diagnosis considered were hepatitis, steroid hepatopathy, lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, metastasis and amyloidosis, possibly associated with nodular hyperplasia. A mild homogenous echoic pattern was seen in the dependant portion of the gallbladder with some smaller (approximately 5 mm) more echoic non-acoustic shadowing structures in the region of the neck of the gallbladder. This was considered most likely to be a suspension of variably concentrated bile pigment precipitates (sludge) and cholestasis was considered as a possible cause, but there was no sign of obstruction of the bile ducts. Both kidneys had normal size and shape but had increased echogencity of the cortex and medulla and a mildly decreased corticomedullary definition. Several small rounded hypoechoic structures most likely representing nodular hyperplasia or neoplasia were seen in the right pancreatic lobe.\\nUltrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy was scheduled for the following week. Diarrhea and one episode of vomiting were observed on the day of the planned biopsy procedure but immediately prior to the biopsy procedure the clinical condition of the dog was considered stable and the dog had normal temperature, thus the biopsy was performed as planned.\\nA standard anesthetic protocol including propofol induction and isoflurane maintenance was used. Two free-hand ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsies (18 gauge needle, BARD biopsy needle and BARD magnum biopsy instrument, Crawley, UK) using a longitudinal plane and targeting two of the focal heterogenous areas of the liver via a left cranial abdominal window were taken. The biopsy needle position was maintained to the left and dorsal to the gallbladder and the gallbladder avoided during penetration of the liver and firing of the biopsy device. No complications were detected during the procedure or when the biopsy region was scanned immediately after the procedure. The dog was discharged the following day since it was reported to be bright and alert with normal temperature and only one occasion of diarrhea and vomit had occurred post-biopsy.\\nThe dog was returned to the clinic two days later when the owner reported that the diarrhea and vomiting had increased in frequency and the general condition of the dog had acutely deteriorated. Clinical examination revealed fever, dyspnea, ataxia and subcutaneous emphysema. Laboratory tests showed neutrophilia with moderate left-shift, hundredfold increased value of C-reactive protein and a mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis (HCO3\u2212 15.6 mmol/l [ref 22.2-27.2 mmol/l] and PCO2 19.1 kPa [31.8-54 kPa]).\\nUltrasonography (linear probe VFX 13-5 MHz, Sonoline Antares, Siemens Medical Solution, Mountain View, USA) was done unsedated with the dog in lateral recumbency. A diffusely outlined focal area of severe hyperechogenicity associated with multiple reverberation artefacts was seen in the region of the previous liver biopsy and was considered to be intrahepatic gas (Figure \\n). No evidence of pneumoperitoneum, pleural effusion or rupture of the biliary system or gastrointestinal tract was detected. Radiographs confirmed the focal region of radiolucent gas in the liver (Figure \\n). Hepatic emphysema due to gas producing bacteria was strongly suspected. The clinical condition of the patient rapidly worsened and the dog died within 3 hours of readmission.\\nPost-mortem examination revealed acute hepatitis with hemorrhage, chronic hepatitis with dissecting fibrosis, and hepatic nodular hyperplasia. An extensive acute necrotizing hemorrhagic myositis was seen in the hind limb musculature. The intestinal mucosa was autolytic but a mild to moderate infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells was noted. Focal chronic pancreatitis and nodular hyperplasia, chronic glomerulonephritis with focal areas of emphysema in the renal cortex, and a chronic hemorrhagic cystitis was diagnosed, as was myxomatous valvular degeneration of the mitral valves and cardiac hemorrhage. Swabs were taken from the hind limb musculature for bacteriology and Clostridium perfringens was isolated in pure culture. Samples for bacteriology were not taken from the liver.", "age": "[[11.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17552445': 1, '27047120': 1, '23292663': 1, '24016137': 1, '4578268': 1, '7783433': 1, '9397978': 1, '22561510': 1, '17413611': 1, '24303461': 1, '23277693': 1, '1092772': 1, '24758285': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
