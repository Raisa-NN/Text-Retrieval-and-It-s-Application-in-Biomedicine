Echo showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dense spontaneous LV contrast. He was treated as an embolic stroke and had gradually improved over three months to Grade 4 power on the left side. He was again admitted with sudden onset difficulty to speak and understand after he had been noncompliant with medications. The neurological examination showed a significant aphasia with no facial or limb weakness on the right side and Grade 4 power on the left side due to the old stroke. The CT scan performed 24 hours post-stroke showed an old perisylvian infarct in the right hemisphere and a new infarct in the left posterior temporoparietal region []. MRI could not be done due to poor patient cooperation. Echo revealed LV systolic dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy. Carotid Doppler was normal. He was classified under cardioembolic stroke as per the TOAST criteria. WAB scores showed global aphasia which evolved into a Wernicke's aphasia on a follow-up examination four weeks later.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9434084': 1, '10084536': 1, '2812337': 1, '3827682': 1, '25657725': 1, '3808300': 1, '34725611': 2, '33706719': 2, '14675616': 1, '7199663': 1, '7678184': 1, '2749846': 1, '22028531': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3200041-1': 2, '3200041-2': 2, '3200041-3': 2, '7949244-1': 1, '8555749-1': 1}"}
