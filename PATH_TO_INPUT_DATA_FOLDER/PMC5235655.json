His symptoms further progressed to left-sided facial droop, complete eyelid ptosis, marked impairment of left ocular motility, and left-sided hearing loss that had gradually progressed over two years (Figure ). An orbital apex syndrome was diagnosed, and an MRI of the brain and orbits revealed pathological enhancement within the superior orbital fissure, foramen rotundum, and foramen ovale with extension into the superior orbital fissure. A biopsy of the supraorbital branch of the facial nerve revealed PNI of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma positive for cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 (Figure -C). A tumor board regarded his Stage IV SCC to be unresectable and that he was a poor candidate for radiation therapy due to his complicated medical history and diffuse spread of the tumor. The patient was started on systemic chemotherapy for palliative care and subsequently died within one year.", "age": "[[81.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10812708': 1, '17019414': 1, '18050125': 1, '12234899': 1, '9307641': 1, '1607418': 1, '9304529': 1, '16714930': 1, '28097083': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5235655-1': 2}"}
