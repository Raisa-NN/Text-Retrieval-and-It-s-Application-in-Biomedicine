His chest radiograph showed expiratory air trapping in the left lung, and a CT scan revealed a 4-mm foreign body at the left main bronchus. His initial ABGA findings included: pH 7.48; PCO2 27.9 mmHg; PO2 70.2 mmHg; and oxygen saturation 94.5%. Emergency flexible bronchoscopy under general anesthesia was planned. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental (50 mg) and rocuronium (5 mg). The patient was intubated with an ETT (ID 4.5 Sheridan Sheridan\u00ae uncuffed\u2122, Teleflex Medical, Durham, USA), and controlled ventilation was maintained. The same procedure described in the first case was performed, and the foreign body was removed successfully. During the procedure, his saturation was maintained at 100%, airway pressure was below 20 mmHg, and the end tidal carbon dioxide was maintained at about 30 mmHg.", "age": "[[13.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'28250606': 1, '16430406': 1, '19735812': 1, '12891487': 1, '18405721': 1, '10466601': 1, '21927695': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3167144-1': 2}"}
