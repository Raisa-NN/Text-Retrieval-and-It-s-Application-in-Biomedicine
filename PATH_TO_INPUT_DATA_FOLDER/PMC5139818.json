Over the past five years, he had undergone extensive inpatient evaluations at several hospitals for OGIB without a cause identified. On this occasion, the patient was found to have a hemoglobin of 5.7. He underwent a push enteroscopy which showed no obvious bleeding source and colonoscopy which showed evidence of old hemorrhage. A repeat video capsule endoscopy (VCE; Pill Cam SB, GIVEN, Yokneam, Israel) was performed which showed several polyploid lesions in the mid small bowel and continuing through the terminal ileum with fresh blood noted (see video).\\nFollowing transfusion with 8 units of packed red blood cells, he was transferred to our facility for retrograde double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). His study was significant for two large, friable, ulcerated sessile polypoid lesions in the mid ileum () and multiple small polypoid lesions in the distal ileum (). Biopsies taken from these polyps showed low-grade neuroendocrine pathology consistent with carcinoid tumor (). Further investigations performed at our medical center included a CT enterography and octreotide scan which confirmed localization of the tumor to the distal small bowel. He later underwent successful laparoscopic partial small bowel resection.", "age": "[[64.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30333421': 1, '18770038': 1, '19836488': 1, '18270840': 1, '19555947': 1, '31207533': 1, '27942327': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
