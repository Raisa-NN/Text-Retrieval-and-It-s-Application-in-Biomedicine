On clinical examination, about 4.0\u00d70.3 cm, serpiginous cyst was found. It was not tender, the skin over the cyst was normal and it was not attached to the penile shaft. There were no signs of pain, tenderness, pruritus, or other symptoms. His past medical history was irrelevant. He denied traumatism and risky or vigorous sexual activities. Patient was taken up for surgery and excision of the mass was performed under local anaesthesia. Histological evaluation revealed the presence of a cyst in the dermis (). The inner surface of the cyst and the papillary projections are lined by a row of columnar secretory cells of variable height showing decapitation secretion indicative of apocrine secretion. Peripheral to the layer of secretory cells are elongated myoepithelial cells. Immunohistochemically, the inner cells show cytoplasmic stains for cytokeratin (CK) 7 and outer cells show nuclear stains for p63, respectively. CK20 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are negative in both cells. A diagnosis of apocrine hidrocystoma of the penis was established.", "age": "[[39.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23449811': 1, '10230234': 1, '23451813': 1, '23740163': 1, '4358807': 1, '4311673': 1, '8077481': 1, '14170598': 1, '900973': 1, '24978625': 1, '17406184': 1, '19232693': 1, '26341775': 1, '25424028': 1, '10472758': 1, '16983013': 1, '11481524': 1, '33911624': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
