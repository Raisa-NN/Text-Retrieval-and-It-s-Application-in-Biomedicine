Based on the initial magnetic resonance imaging before surgery, anaplastic astrocytoma of the left cerebellum was suspected. Neurosurgeons performed a radical resection of the tumor, and the finial pathologic diagnosis confirmed glioblastoma. The patient received radiation therapy and chemotherapy after the operation. One year later, recurrence of the tumor was suspected, and a neurosurgeon performed a second radical resection of the tumor along with cranioplasty. Four months after the operation, the wound was disrupted due to infection. A neurosurgeon removed the cranial bone and consulted our department in connection with infection control and obliteration of the dead space. Physical examination revealed a closed wound about 8 cm in length, but underneath the closed skin cranial bone or soft tissue was missing. Culturing led to the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Unfortunately, tumor recurrence was also suspicious, and therefore, the neurosurgeon planned radical debridement and additional resection of the tumor, which required reconstruction. The defect was 8\u00d75 cm in size, with exposure of the dura mater (). We used a serratus anterior muscle flap with a split-thickness skin graft to cover the defect. Anastomosis was performed to superficial temporal artery and vein (). Even though we had also considered local flap for reconstruction, the large size and deep depth of the defect, possibility of subclinical infection and radiation injury to adjacent tissue led us to perform free flap reconstruction firstly. Unfortunately, the flap became completely useless 7 days after the operation due to hematoma and venous thrombosis. It was detached and a bilateral rotation flap used to cover the defect with grafted donor site skin (, ). The wound healed completely without infection and the patient was discharged.\\nTwo month later, the patient revisited our hospital with wound disruption and purulent discharge from the wound. Seroma with infection was found due to recurrence of the tumor (). Additional surgery was planned. For exposure, a rotation flap was elevated from the occipital area to create a window for the neurosurgeon to perform radical debridement and resection of the tumor. After resection, the resulting defect was approximately 8\u00d78 cm with exposed brain structures and could not be covered with the previous flap. To reconstruct the defect, two perforator-based flaps were designed, and a handheld Doppler was used to map the perforators adjacent to the defect. To cover the lower portion of the defect, an 8\u00d75 cm occipital artery perforator-based island flap was designed from the left occipital area and neck (). The flap was elevated in the suprafascial layer and rotated superiorly. To reconstruct the remaining upper portion of the defect, the previous rotation flap was re-elevated and transposed to the defect, and to cover the donor site of that flap and the previous skin graft site, an additional rotation flap was designed from the vertex and transposed inferiorly (, ). All donor sites were closed primarily. The patient was discharged two weeks after surgery without any complications. Two months later, the patient died.", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8460180': 1, '23147312': 1, '32206533': 1, '11601572': 1, '20679829': 1, '23642666': 1, '9664876': 1, '11335798': 1, '31413048': 1, '11447003': 1, '14732646': 1, '11994580': 1, '28913317': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
