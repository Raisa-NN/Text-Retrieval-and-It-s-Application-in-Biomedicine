He had no significant comorbidities. At physical examination he presented with deformity located on the left elbow, he was unable to passively or actively mobilize it, he reported paresthesias and diminished sensation located on the fifth and fourth digit. X-rays showed a dislocation on the left elbow and an avulsive fracture of the medial epicondyle of the distal humerus (Fig. ). He was taken to the operating room where a closed manipulation was performed; however the reduction was not achieved due to the interposition of the fractured medial epicondyle. A medial approach to the elbow was performed; intra-operative findings included rupture of the medial capsule and intra-articular interposition of the fragment of the medial epicondyle with a posterolateral dislocation of the elbow, the ulnar nerve showed compressive injuries at the site of the fracture (Fig. ). Extraction and fixation of the interposed intra-articular fragment was performed followed by elbow reduction and a medial capsule repair, without ulnar nerve transposition (Fig. ). The patient was left with a posterior splint for a month. After a 3 month follow-up, he has recovered full range of motion of the elbow with recovery of strength and sensation over the distribution of the ulnar nerve.", "age": "[[14.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20555271': 1, '20093953': 1, '25062665': 1, '1116051': 1, '26546588': 2, '28435584': 2, '22588097': 1, '15446537': 1, '23439311': 1, '29308180': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5393124-1': 1, '4635321-1': 1}"}
