It is understood according to patient's history that he had a multiple heated Vaseline injection done under penis skin one month ago for augmenting his penis. In patient's physical examination, it was palpated that there were soft-formed fixed and widespread mass lesions under penis skin. No deformation was found on penis skin surface (). Patient stated that he had normal erection but he felt pain during sexual relation. In preoperative examinations done on the patient, no biochemical or hematological disorder was detected.\\nIn patient's superficial tissue ultrasonography, a thickening nearly 10 mm and obvious eco increase at extratunical level on penis root and penile shaft proximal section's dorsal side and tissue field with similar appearance on penile shaft distal section's ventral side were reported. No pathology was detected on both corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum.\\nIt was decided to make an operation on the patient in order to pull out the foreign substance. Degloving was done to penis with circumcision incision after intraoperative urethral catheter was inserted and it was seen that tunica albugiane was intact. However, vaseline was spreaded among the subcutaneous layers to the highest degree and caused cohesion and granulomatous reaction. Vaseline was pulled out by being separated from tissues through dissection and necrotic fields which were excited. Layers were enclosed with anatomic plan after all foreign substances were pulled out and penis was bandaged up with an elastic bandage. On second postoperative day, the patient whose bandage was opened had been discharged from hospital as his wound appearance was seen better, with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication therapy. It was seen that penis skin was going under necrosis on the 7th postoperative day during patient followup and patient's consultation is done at plastic surgery clinic. Patient again hospitalized by plastic surgery clinic, was operated again as circular necrosis was reformed on penis skin during patient follow-up process, and defect repair was done with split thickness skin graft prepared from right-anterior femoral skin.", "age": "[[42.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12937800': 1, '7975744': 1, '4120756': 1, '17722250': 2, '18355202': 1, '3378890': 1, '16502060': 1, '29080947': 1, '25490921': 1, '26379868': 1, '7034015': 1, '23213616': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2628043-1': 1}"}
