The Helicobacter pylori infection test was negative. Laboratory evaluation findings, including a complete blood profile and serum biochemistry were within normal limits. EGD (GIF-H190; Olympus Medical Systems) revealed a large approximately 3.2-cm intramural submucosal lesion in the gastric cardia. The lesion was resected using EFTR, which resulted in a large full-thickness wall defect. Multiple attempts to close the defect utilizing various conventional and modern techniques failed. Therefore, omental patching was performed in which an omental fat plug was pulled into the gastric lumen and affixed to the gastric wall with hemoclips. However, adequate defect closure could not be achieved. Purse-string endosutures were then used around the clips to achieve reliable closure. The pathologic findings of the resected specimen were consistent with GIST (mitotic rate, <5/50 HPF), and negative resection margins marked the clinical success of EFTR. The patient\u2019s recovery was uneventful and he was discharged from the hospital on day 4 of admission.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20598252': 1, '23588710': 1, '26364964': 1, '8428298': 1, '34354798': 1, '31231706': 1, '33969720': 1, '20204697': 1, '28753696': 1, '28756513': 1, '25701060': 1, '24619327': 1, '16564858': 1, '29658644': 1, '24373001': 1, '31970177': 1, '30300981': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6547348-1': 2, '6547348-2': 2}"}
