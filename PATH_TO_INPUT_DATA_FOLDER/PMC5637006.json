She was then lost to follow-up and re-presented 5 years later with several years of intermittent abdominal pain and heartburn. Her initial endoscopy showed mild esophagitis characterized by edema and furrows (Fig. ). She was again inconsistent with follow-up and treatment until October 2011. Her symptoms had progressed to more frequent upper abdominal pain as well as solid food dysphagia. Her endoscopy at that time showed diffuse rings, narrowing, furrows, edema, and exudates, but without a clear focal stricture (Fig. ).", "age": "[[9.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'30710696': 1, '15329438': 1, '14724818': 1, '24813517': 1, '33613690': 1, '31616746': 1, '32336463': 1, '30074576': 1, '30466674': 1, '19733260': 1, '31499249': 1, '33052498': 1, '31515617': 1, '24275329': 1, '32759578': 1, '25710524': 1, '30678839': 1, '32378700': 1, '21477849': 1, '23567357': 1, '23954315': 1, '30201096': 1, '22610003': 1, '28774845': 1, '31647967': 1, '29033756': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5637006-1': 2, '5637006-2': 2, '5637006-3': 2, '5637006-4': 2, '5637006-5': 2}"}
