Thunderclap headache as presentation of ischemic posterior circulation stroke", "patient": "A 49-year-old man presented after the onset of a sudden throbbing laterocervical right pain, rapidly spreading bilaterally to his head, reaching the maximum of its intensity in 1 minute. Headache was associated with nausea, dizziness, blurred vision and bilateral tinnitus. Patient's past medical history was significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. He did not report any recent head traumas, physical efforts or consumption of vasoactive drugs. He had recently undergone chiropractor procedures. At arrival to our institution, nausea and blurred vision had resolved, a mild bilateral tinnitus, as well as mild frontal and occipital headache persisted. Neurological examination was unremarkable, particularly he had no neck stiffness, neither photophobia. Brain CT and neurovascular ultrasound examination were normal. An MR of the brain with MR Angiography (MRA) disclosed any dissection but revealed multiple small recent ischemic lesions in the cerebellar hemispheres and in the left occipital lobe (Figure ).\\nHe underwent a CT angiography that confirmed MRA findings. Laboratory analysis, including hypercoagulable tests, was normal. He was treated immediately with antiplatelet drugs and he has been asymptomatic ever since. Echocardiography and transcranial color Doppler with bubble test were normal. He underwent a second MRA that did not show any intramural hematoma suggestive for artery dissection. He was discharged after one week and further tests were scheduled, including transesophageal echocardiography and Holter-EKG.", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16618276': 1, '23303883': 1, '28132215': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
