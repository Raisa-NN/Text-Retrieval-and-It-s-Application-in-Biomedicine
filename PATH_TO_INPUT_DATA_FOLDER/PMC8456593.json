Prior to that, he had an episode of acute urinary retention requiring temporary indwelling catheterization. MRI of the whole spine done at another center concluded degenerative spine disease. Upon assessment, sensation was reduced below the L4 dermatome. Repeat MRI showed a longitudinal extensive T2 hyperintense contrast enhancing intramedullary lesion from T6 to L1. His lower limb weakness deteriorated soon after the first dose of Methylprednisolone. Despite strong clinical suspicious of SAVF, his spinal angiogram was negative for this. He received a course of IV Methylprednisolone followed by plasmapheresis but showed no remarkable improvement. Within a year, he was readmitted twice for similar relapses and responded poorly to IV methylprednisolone. Repeated MRI spine demonstrated a worsening contrast enhanced T2 hyperintense lesion involving T4 to the conus medullaris with dilated spinal veins seen most prominently from T10 to L1 level (Fig. a and b). A second spinal angiogram confirmed a SAVF with feeders from the left 12th posterior intercostal arteries and L1 lumbar artery. Despite successful embolisation, his neurological recovery was poor.", "age": "[[56.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17493539': 1, '26041099': 1, '29898828': 1, '28729296': 1, '25175433': 1, '33186917': 1, '28862546': 1, '22592367': 1, '19213818': 1, '12408397': 1, '2760642': 1, '32386730': 1, '1174785': 1, '30385361': 1, '32858225': 1, '7717320': 1, '31919141': 1, '31629319': 1, '31466101': 1, '28780588': 1, '26195333': 1, '28220287': 1, '34548039': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8456593-1': 2, '8456593-2': 2, '8456593-3': 2}"}
