The patient reported a near-syncopal episode the night preceding the fall and progressive lower extremity weakness over the course of the morning. On arrival to the ED, he complained of lower extremity weakness with noted initial 2+ palpable, bilateral femoral and dorsalis pedis pulses. Shortly thereafter, he lost palpable femoral pulses bilaterally and had noted cool lower extremities. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was remarkable for kinking and occlusion of the abdominal aorta endograft below the renal vessels (\u2013). The patient was taken to the operating room emergently with successful axillobifemoral bypass revascularization.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29850426': 1, '15978925': 1, '28760663': 1, '32926719': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
