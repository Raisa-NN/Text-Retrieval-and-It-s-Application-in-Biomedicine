After physical examination, repeated transvaginal ultrasound scans, and an endometrial biopsy, moderately differentiated subtype I (according to the Bokhman classification) uterine cancer was diagnosed. The patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The operation was performed without complications, and the tumor was staged as IIIc based on the revised surgical-pathological FIGO classification. Final pathological assessment revealed a uterine moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of endometrioid subtype deeply infiltrating the myometrium as well as the uterine cervix. Three intramural leiomyomas were detected. No pathological abnormalities in the adnexa were reported. Surprisingly, CLL/SLL was simultaneously diagnosed in all pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes that had been removed. The patient was discharged on day 7 and she was forwarded to the Oncology Center of Lublin, Lublin, Poland, for adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She is still on follow-up.", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16520465': 1, '11592772': 1, '25818398': 1, '28975027': 2, '15621780': 1, '26277675': 1, '24385769': 1, '17351903': 1, '31590673': 2, '19114699': 1, '27334532': 1, '15115650': 1, '18216293': 1, '23335539': 1, '29928215': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6781389-1': 1, '5621112-1': 1}"}
