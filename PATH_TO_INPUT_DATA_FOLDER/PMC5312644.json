He had inserted a self-made foreign body into himself several months previously []. We first attempted to retrieve the foreign body via the transurethral approach; however, it had become severely calcified and could not be removed []. We then performed an open bladder wall incision to successfully remove the foreign body. The removed object was a metallic tube that was covered with elastic rubber, which had a smooth surface and which had undergone calcification []. At two weeks after surgery, the urethral catheter was successfully removed; the absence of leakage was confirmed by cystography.", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1737252': 1, '6238164': 1, '1855535': 1, '27613565': 1, '14779366': 1, '30525007': 1, '29804080': 1, '10893567': 1, '238320': 1, '28214761': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
