She was discharged home with symptomatic treatment after complete resolution of symptoms and exclusion of all neurological causes. However, she subsequently developed horizontal diplopia and gait abnormalities and was readmitted to hospital because of abnormal eye movements and conjugate gaze palsy.\\nPhysical examination was otherwise normal, but the mental status examination showed reduced attention. On cranial nerve examination, abduction was bilaterally limited with a compensatory abduction nystagmus. Pupils were normal. Dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia were found on the left side of the body.\\nIncreased signal intensity in the right pontomesencephalic junction was observed on T2-FLAIR and diffusion-weighted MRI sequences (). White matter hyperintensity was also found in the left cerebellar hemisphere; these lesions appeared hypointense on T1 and ADC map sequences, suggestive of infarction. MRA findings were consistent with dissection of the left V4 vertebral artery (). Antiplatelet therapy was initiated with subsequent follow-up in a vascular disease clinic.", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21300735': 1, '19673451': 1, '25308307': 1, '15883257': 1, '31293990': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
