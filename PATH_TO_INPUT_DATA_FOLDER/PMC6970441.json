He had spent an hour running barefoot, with his basenji, on the hot sand at a dog beach in Del Mar, California during a sunny afternoon in August. After he concluded his activity, he noticed that it was difficult to walk on his painful feet.\\nCutaneous examination of the sites that had come in contact with the sand showed bright erythematous patches on the distal and lateral aspects of his plantar feet and the distal phalanx of his toes; in addition, blisters were present on the great, second and third toes of both feet (Figure ). Areas that either did not come in contact with or had less exposure to the sand were spared; these included not only the dorsal feet but also the instep of his medial plantar arch and the proximal phalanx of each toe.\\nCorrelation of the history and clinical examination established the diagnosis of a first-degree and a superficial second-degree, thermal burn from the hot beach sand. The affected areas were repeatedly soaked in cold water to relieve off the pain. The symptoms and lesions progressively resolved without any additional intervention within the following week.", "age": "[[27.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'32537275': 2, '19970971': 1, '34834914': 1, '31472769': 1, '21128915': 1, '28216728': 1, '26862537': 1, '894074': 1, '5837402': 1, '16135158': 1, '9443594': 1, '6738412': 1, '19741354': 1, '31268792': 1, '20883263': 1, '16844514': 1, '24068119': 1, '17147557': 1, '24518115': 1, '33403185': 2, '33773419': 1, '71820': 1, '8886789': 1, '19970955': 1, '31993267': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7286585-1': 1, '7773311-1': 1}"}
