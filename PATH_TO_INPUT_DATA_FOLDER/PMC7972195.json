At admission, her height SDS was \u2212 1.48 and weight was 15 kg (50th\u201375th centile). There were abnormalities in ANC (0.82 \u00d7 10^9 /L), TG (3.92 mmol/L), fasting glucose (3.48 mmol/L), lactic acid (9.61 mmol/L), and uric acid (519 \u03bcmol/L). The liver ultrasound suggested hepatomegaly. She also underwent liver biopsy and was tested for glucose response to epinephrine stimulation after overnight fasting and the results were positive. Therefore, she was clinically diagnosed as GSD. She was given oral uncooked cornstarch regularly. At the age of 10 years and a half, she was finally diagnosed with GSD type 1b through genetic testing. At the last visit, her triglycerides, lactic acid, pyruvic acid and uric acid were decreased than before. Her fasting hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis have been significantly improved. She had a history of upper respiratory tract infections, about once a year.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'25356975': 1, '29663270': 1, '10960498': 1, '31788408': 1, '18206704': 1, '21575371': 1, '10874322': 1, '12373585': 1, '16490377': 1, '25288127': 1, '29581464': 2, '15906092': 1, '28685844': 1, '20975743': 1, '11032333': 1, '9463334': 1, '31536830': 1, '20498302': 1, '28173655': 1, '28389590': 1, '32772503': 1, '10931421': 1, '28224773': 1, '12409273': 1, '33731098': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5980106-1': 1, '5980106-2': 1}"}
