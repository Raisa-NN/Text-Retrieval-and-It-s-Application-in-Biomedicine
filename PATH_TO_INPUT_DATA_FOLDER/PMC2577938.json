His resuscitation spanned over 90 minutes, with recurrent periods of PEA arrest. Initial examination revealed eyes opening to noxious stimuli, extensor posturing, and intact brainstem reflexes (GCS=4T). Head CT revealed global cerebral edema, and mannitol was administered empirically. Repeat head CT 20 hours after the first scan showed resolution of edema, and the patient was moving purposefully and following commands. After extubation the next day, he was conversant but exhibited significant short-term memory loss. MRI performed 1 day post-arrest revealed a small region of restricted diffusion in the left splenium (Fig. ), without any other T2 or DWI abnormalities. His main neurological deficit was short-term memory loss.", "age": "[[27.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31338025': 1, '3143229': 1, '22802803': 1, '15918025': 1, '11110540': 1, '11198202': 1, '20931362': 1, '11151683': 1, '9635948': 1, '10589585': 1, '8938760': 1, '3143234': 1, '26550404': 1, '16864809': 1, '16284771': 1, '3257624': 1, '11598495': 1, '32062761': 1, '14991261': 1, '24164954': 1, '15372245': 1, '11254767': 1, '31904898': 1, '9248790': 1, '20585768': 1, '22566735': 2, '15767508': 1, '23077393': 1, '16944123': 1, '22492052': 1, '16614789': 1, '28978697': 1, '19018311': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2577938-1': 2, '2577938-2': 2, '2577938-3': 2, '2577938-4': 2, '3345598-1': 1, '3345598-2': 1, '3345598-3': 1, '3345598-4': 1}"}
