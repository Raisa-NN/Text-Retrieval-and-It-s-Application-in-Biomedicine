Due to the suspicion of omphalopagus conjoined twins in a triplet pregnancy, she was transferred to our department at 14 weeks, and ultrasound examination in our hospital showed omphalopagus conjoined twins in a DCDA triplet pregnancy. In the conjoined twins, there was a 4.7 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 4.5 cm cystic space in the amniotic cavity of the conjoined twins, which was connected to the two bladders of conjoined twins. Only one allantoic artery could be seen on the surface of both fetal bladders, and a urachal cyst was suspected to be present (Fig. A). The couple had no family history of congenital anomalies.\\nThe staffs of multidisciplinary team extensively counseled the couple. Based on the couple\u2019s choice, selective termination of the conjoined twins was performed by ultrasound-guided intrathoracic injection of KCl at 15 weeks and 2 days of gestation, and amniocentesis was done in the other fetus, not in the conjoined twins. Images of the live fetus and conjoined twins after selective termination are shown in Fig. B. The result of chromosome microarray analysis in the living fetus was normal.\\nAt 33 weeks and 6 days, a healthy female baby weighing 2450 g was delivered due to suspected fetal distress, with Apgar scores of 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 min, respectively, whereas the papyraceous conjoined fetuses weighed 84 g. The baby is now one month old, and she is in good health.", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11169378': 1, '28231064': 1, '34011891': 1, '7474060': 1, '28251228': 2, '32371638': 1, '22670489': 1, '30334537': 1, '12905520': 1, '28195364': 1, '3056008': 1, '11810089': 1, '28625760': 1, '33530268': 2, '15278382': 1, '30150080': 1, '8811563': 1, '3898849': 1, '22567498': 2, '29057694': 1, '21564411': 1, '16337075': 1, '29375901': 1, '28298949': 1, '28186636': 1, '15295375': 1, '10831580': 1, '8799928': 1, '12486760': 1, '17142535': 1, '10486497': 1, '24381845': 1, '18177828': 1, '25926295': 1, '21860927': 1, '6726862': 1, '31001856': 1, '26730249': 2, '18976995': 1, '16211442': 1, '9764683': 1, '28444191': 1, '8822428': 1, '24971140': 1, '20683793': 1, '5129539': 1, '34625055': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8501706-1': 2, '8501706-2': 2, '3335527-1': 1, '7850647-1': 1, '5387909-1': 1, '4695689-1': 1}"}
