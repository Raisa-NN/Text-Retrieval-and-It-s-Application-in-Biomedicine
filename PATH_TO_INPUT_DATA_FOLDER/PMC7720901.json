It had been moving in a linear line and disturbed the sleep. She had diplegic cerebral palsy and developmental delay and started to walk recently. Since then, she was playing with cats all the time and sitting in the soil without pants. Parents were government employees and the child had been cared for by the grandparents. The child was treated initially with miconazole cream as for tinea corporis by the outpatient department with no improvement. Her immunization was up to date. Physical examination revealed an erythematous and curvilinear lesion, sized 10-12 cm in length, and pruritic (Figure ). Other system examination had been normal. Her basic blood investigations were within normal limits. The condition was diagnosed as cutaneous larva migrans and treated with oral albendazole for 14 days with complete improvement.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'34218593': 1, '9394995': 1, '26538729': 2, '7534125': 1, '17656960': 1, '18471775': 1, '15928447': 1, '8481019': 1, '25610118': 1, '7165902': 1, '26288443': 2, '11277961': 1, '2297509': 1, '12390594': 1, '33304671': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7720901-1': 2, '7720901-2': 2, '7720901-3': 2, '7720901-4': 2, '4533573-1': 1, '4533573-2': 1, '4533573-3': 1, '4533573-4': 1, '4533573-5': 1, '4601450-1': 1}"}
