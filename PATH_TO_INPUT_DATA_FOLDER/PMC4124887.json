A physical examination on admission was normal. A chest radiography showed a rounded and homogeneous opacity.\\nA computed tomography (CT) showed, at the middle mediastinum in laterovertebral view, behind the right main bronchus, a liquid formation with well limited contours and regular thin wall containing within cubicles separated by septa. After injection of contrast material, the wall and septa were discreetly enhanced (Figures and ). We noted the absence of HC intraparenchyma, with the presence of centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema. An abdominal ultrasound was normal. The results of laboratory tests showed a leukocytosis of 14,930 cells/mm and that hydatid serology tests (hemagglutination, bentonite flocculation and latex agglutination tests) were positive.\\nHe underwent a posterolateral thoracotomy through the right-side sixth intercostal space, showing a posterior mediastinal cystic mass that occupied the upper and anterior mediastinum. After a needle aspiration of the cyst, several vesicles were removed (Figures and ). Extensive washing of his mediastinal cavity was performed with hydrogen peroxide. The postoperative outcome was adequate. He was treated with albendazole 400mg one tablet per day. His condition evolved favorably.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17213771': 1, '12297179': 1, '21167443': 1, '15094629': 1, '19367207': 1, '31194476': 2, '33294371': 2, '12559365': 1, '12781644': 1, '24099329': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7089745-1': 1, '7695957-1': 1}"}
