He required transfusion with seven units of blood before resolution with conservative measures. He had undergone transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) 8 and 15 years before, and his only regular medication was fish oil. Cystoscopy revealed massive regrowth of prostatic tissue with a large intravesical component. There was significant vascularity and contact bleeding was noted. CT excluded upper tract sources of hematuria and confirmed a markedly enlarged prostate measuring 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 11 cm (), and prostatic volume was estimated at 436 cc by ultrasonography of the prostate. His serum prostate-specific antigen was 17.9 ng/mL. Despite medical combination therapy of dutasteride and tamsulosin, during the next 12 months his urinary symptoms worsened and he continued to have intermittent hematuria. Uroflowmetry confirmed a poor voiding flow rate of 8.4 mL/s maximum flow and residual bladder volume of 400 mL, and we decided to proceed to HoLEP as an elective procedure.\\nDuring operation, the prostate was resected in 135 minutes using a 550-micron holmium:YAG laser fiber at 2 J \u00d7 50 Hz. Morcellation took 90 minutes by using the PIRANHA morcellation system (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) with a total operating time of 225 minutes. The resected prostate tissue weighed 314 g. Postoperative catheterization time was about 35 hours and trial of void was effective with a residual bladder volume of 24 mL. There were no perioperative complications and blood transfusion was not necessary. Pre- and postprocedure hemoglobin levels were 135 and 150 g/L, respectively. The duration of inpatient stay was \u223c53 hours.\\nHistopathologic examination of the prostatic tissue showed nodular hyperplasia without malignant change. At outpatient follow-up 2 months later, the patient reported good urinary flow with no further episodes of hematuria. Repeat uroflowmetry and ultrasonography showed a markedly improved maximum voiding flow rate of 28 mL/s with a voided volume of 584 mL and a residual bladder volume of 27 mL.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25416347': 1, '23054505': 1, '17869409': 1, '7691015': 1, '15072629': 1, '24917753': 1, '9831789': 1, '19575692': 1, '9471043': 1, '27579406': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
