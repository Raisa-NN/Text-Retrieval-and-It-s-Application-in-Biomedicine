She had last been seen in our health system 1.5 years before and had intermittently received care in multiple area healthcare systems. She had known COPD with active smoking, periodontal disease, sick sinus syndrome status postpermanent pacemaker implantation, and urinary frequency. During her admission she was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure. She had no history of industrial exposures. Her only medications included albuterol and occasional inhaled corticosteroids.\\nIn the ED, workup revealed a large (6.1 \u00d7 5.5 cm) fungating right shoulder mass (), and the X-ray of her pelvis showed a pathologic fracture of the right iliac wing. She underwent CT of her pelvis, spine, and right shoulder without contrast, of her head with and without contrast, and of her chest/abdomen/pelvis with PO and IV contrast. These studies were remarkable for a pathologic fracture of the right iliac wing, multiple additional pelvic lytic lesions including the sacrum, right inferior pubic ramus, and left iliac wing, and lytic lesions in the right mandibular condyle, left occipital condyle, left posterior rib, right third rib, and L2 vertebral body, all concerning for metastatic disease. The shoulder CT suggested the overlying mass did not extend into underlying muscle but did identify several subcutaneous satellite nodules. The CT abdomen/pelvis showed left renal parenchymal irregularity suspicious for malignancy and bilateral adrenal nodules concerning for metastases.\\nOn questioning, the patient reported she had fallen due to worsening of her chronic right hip pain. Her daughter reported that her right shoulder lesion had been draining, bleeding, and enlarging for two years but had been present for many years longer and that her mother had been told repeatedly to see a dermatologist but had never followed up.\\nShe was seen by dermatology in the ED, who performed a shave biopsy of her right shoulder mass on hospital day (HD) 1. She was admitted to a medical service with orthopaedic oncology and medical oncology following. Medical oncology felt her most likely diagnosis was renal cell carcinoma but proposed that multiple myeloma or metastatic skin cancer also needed consideration. The pathology from her initial shave biopsy returned as nodular, ulcerated basal cell carcinoma extending to the base of the sections. Because of the small size of her adrenal masses and the inaccessibility of her renal mass, she underwent fine needle aspiration and biopsy of her right iliac crest bony lesion on HD2. The pathology for this was reported as \u201cmetastatic carcinoma morphologically consistent with patient's known basal cell carcinoma of the skin\u201d (). Immunohistochemical staining showed the tumor cells were positive for p40, CK 5/6, focally positive for p63, BerEP4, GATA-3, and negative for CK 7, CK 20, CDX2, PAX-8, TTF-1, napsin, and uroplakin II, supporting the diagnosis [].\\nOn HD6, due to the fungating nature of her right shoulder lesion and persistent bleeding, she underwent wide local excision of her shoulder mass. This pathology again showed ulcerated basal cell carcinoma with features of nodular and morpheaform subtypes invading to a depth of 1.0 cm, with negative margins. There was evidence of perineural invasion and one focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion (Figures \u2013).\\nIn addition to the previously imaged osseous lesions, a technetium bone scan performed on HD4 demonstrated metastatic lesions in the right and left mid femoral shafts (). CT of the right femur without contrast performed on HD9 showed a 4.2 cm lytic metastatic lesion in the posterolateral middiaphysis with associated cortical thinning and endosteal scalloping, involving two-thirds of the cortical thickness. She underwent prophylactic cephalomedullary nailing of her right femur on HD13. She was treated by radiation oncology with 30 gray in 10 fractions to her right hemiplevis and 8 gray to the right femur postoperatively.\\nAdditionally, she underwent biopsy of a suspicious right leg skin lesion on HD8. The pathology was consistent with melanoma.\\nOn discharge from the hospital, the patient followed up with oncology and was schedule for a PET/CT to better assess her adrenal lesions and for wide reexcision of her right leg melanoma. She was to begin a hedgehog inhibitor (vismodegib) after her PET/CT. However, she was lost to follow-up and represented to our ED 7 weeks after discharge with shortness of breath. She was found to be in diastolic heart failure and to have a subsegmental pulmonary embolus and was started on therapeutic low molecular weight heparin. She was also found to have a new right scapula pathologic fracture. She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation and expired 3 weeks later.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'7567680': 1, '22300237': 1, '24199850': 1, '16962022': 1, '11107052': 1, '21216106': 1, '22670903': 1, '30219896': 1, '28574612': 1, '25702956': 1, '27096888': 1, '27067394': 1, '24412051': 1, '23677097': 1, '8176018': 1, '8238781': 1, '332091': 1, '30142876': 1, '30332521': 1, '34123684': 1, '25928283': 1, '22670909': 1, '6736323': 1, '28391557': 1, '32776227': 1, '31341689': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
