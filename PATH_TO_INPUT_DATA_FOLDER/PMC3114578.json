There were no other significant complaints. The patient had undergone right-sided radical nephrectomy 4 years back (histopathology of resected kidney revealed renal papillary cell carcinoma). General and systemic examinations revealed no abnormality, except for the presence of a right-sided flank scar. Ultrasonography revealed the presence of a 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm mass in relation to the right ureteric orifice. Microscopic examination of the urinary sample did not reveal the presence of any malignant cells. Hematological and biochemistry examinations were within normal limits. Cystoscopy revealed a polypoidal mass protruding out of the right ureteric orifice, and this mass was resected []. Histopathology of the resected tissue was suggestive of NA. Excision of the ureteric stump with bladder cuff was performed [] and histopathology of the excised mass revealed mesonephric tubules, usually lined by a single layer of bland cuboidal or hobnail cells. Cells had clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm, small nuclei and no prominent nucleoli with thickened basement membrane. Stromal edema and inflammatory infiltrate were also seen, which were suggestive of NA [].", "age": "[[18.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17667548': 1, '16998318': 1, '1258250': 1, '7206067': 1, '22294274': 1, '14785074': 1, '21716880': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
