He reported the ability to express contents out of the bump frequently, but denied any previous trauma to the area, including ear piercings, or any previous treatment. In addition, he reported a benign past medical history.\\nPhysical exam revealed a 4 mm skin colored nodule with a small central opening located on his right earlobe []. Provisional diagnoses included: epidermal inclusion cyst, dilated pore of Winer, and a trichofolliculoma.\\nA 4 mm punch biopsy was performed and sent for routine H and E staining, which revealed bulbous aggregations of isthmic epithelial cells containing sebaceous ducts emanating from a dilated infundibulum and extending into the dermis, consistent with a pilar sheath acanthoma []. In addition to being diagnostic, the biopsy was also curative, and no further treatment was required.", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21769237': 1, '26903752': 1, '718186': 1, '2697113': 1, '34307486': 1, '33946233': 1, '6662259': 1, '3557980': 1, '25368479': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
