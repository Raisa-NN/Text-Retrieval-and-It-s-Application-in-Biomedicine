After regular treatment was unsuccessful, she was treated with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) on January 19, 2021, for acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. MAQUET ECMO equipment was used. The ECMO catheter was implanted into the right femoral vein and left femoral artery under ultrasound guidance. The end of the catheter was confirmed to the level of the right atrium by ultrasound. VA-ECMO was established with a rotational speed of 3500/minute, flow rate of 3.2 L/minute, fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] of 100%, gas flow rate of 4 L/minute, and vasoactive drugs dobutamine 6 \u03bcg/(kg/minute) and norepinephrine 0.1 \u03bcg/(kg/minute) The parameters of the ventilator were adjusted as follows: oxygen concentration 50%, respiratory rate 10 times/minute, tidal volume 5 mL/kg, and positive end-expiratory pressure 8 cmH2O. When ECMO was established, due to abnormal coagulation function (activated clotting time [ACT] > 200 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT] > 160 seconds), anticoagulation was temporarily delayed. A total of 600 mL of plasma and 4 U of red blood cell suspension were supplemented. ACT was monitored every 2 hours. When ACT decreased to less than 200 seconds, heparin anticoagulation was started at APTT of 60 seconds (Fig. ). We conducted a physical examination at the bedside, and we found that the pupil size of the patient\u2019s eyes were not equal, so we performed a computed tomography (CT) examination. The CT report showed cerebral infarction and possibly a small amount of bleeding after infarction in the right parietal lobe. The right frontal lobe showed basal ganglia cavity infarction and elderly brain changes (Fig. ). Because of the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, we used a low-intensity heparin anticoagulation strategy. With the assistance of ECMO, the patient underwent coronary angiography + percutaneous coronary angioplasty + stent implantation aided by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) on January 20 at 08:20\u201309:35. After the operation, the cardiac function gradually recovered and the hemodynamics improved. On January 21, dopamine was stopped, and low-dose norepinephrine combined with dobutamine was continued. Because of the progressive decrease in platelets and the low activity of antithrombin III, the anticoagulation efficiency of unfractionated heparin was considered to decrease, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was not excluded. Argatroban anticoagulation was used to maintain APTT of between 50 and 70 seconds. On January 26, ECMO parameters were adjusted to a rotation speed of 2795 r/minute, blood flow 1.61 L/minute, FiO2% 21%, air flow 1.5 L/minute, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) 90 mmHg. Bedside echocardiography showed that the patient's cardiac systolic function was improved, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (biplane Simpson method) was 35%, and hemodynamics were stable. As the patient's cardiac function improved, we discussed with caregivers and family about the discontinuation of ECMO therapy, and the ECMO was removed after evaluation. On January 27, 2021, color Doppler ultrasound showed 34% LVEF (biplane Simpson method) and thrombosis from the IVC to the atrium (about 70 mm in length, 8 mm in width, with a floating tail end, Fig. a). Enoxaparin was given immediately for 1 mg/kg every 12 hours ih. On February 5, 2021, color Doppler echocardiography showed thrombosis from the IVC to the right atrium entrance (compared with January 27, 2021, volume reduced, shape changed, length about 48 mm, width about 4 mm, tail end floating, Fig. b). On February 19, 2021, color Doppler echocardiography showed no obvious abnormal echo in the IVC; combined with medical history, thrombus disappeared after anticoagulant therapy (Fig. c). Later, the patient's condition gradually stabilized. On the 30th day, she was taken off the ventilator and administered oral rivaroxaban instead of anticoagulants. Due to decreased muscle strength of her limbs, she received rehabilitation exercise and was discharged on the 60th day. Her level of consciousness returned to normal without residual central nervous system-related complications.", "age": "[[75.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'25851390': 1, '23944202': 1, '12324751': 1, '30525232': 1, '28500585': 1, '33429823': 2, '22228837': 1, '18964254': 1, '25860445': 1, '16835785': 1, '33410303': 1, '28184952': 1, '21057061': 1, '33765884': 1, '27511946': 1, '9369503': 1, '30619862': 1, '28857905': 1, '26034197': 1, '34663446': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7793366-1': 1}"}
