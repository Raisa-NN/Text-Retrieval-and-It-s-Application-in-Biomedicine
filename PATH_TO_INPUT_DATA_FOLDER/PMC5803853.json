It was not associated with any other congenital anomalies. There was no family history of similar type of lesion. On examination, a patch of alopecia of size 6 cm \u00d7 3 cm was present over the right side temporal region of the scalp which was studded with multiple discrete pits filled with keratinous material and comedo-like lesions []. In the center of the lesion, there was a dilated cribriform pit and surrounding the skin was normal. There was no evidence of any other physical, mental, and cutaneous abnormalities.\\nRoutine hematological investigations were within normal limits. Mantoux test done to rule out scrofuloderma was found to be negative. Skin biopsy was done for histopathological examination with the differentials of NC and folliculitis decalvans. In histopathological examination under low-power field, epidermis showed hair follicles invagination filled with keratin resembling dilated hair follicles. Dermis showed rudimentary hair follicles and sebaceous gland lobules []. High-power field of same histopathological slide showed large hair follicles containing lamellated keratin but absent hair shaft. Thus, on the basis of histopathology and clinical examination, a diagnosis of NC was made, and the patient was started on topical tretinoin 0.05%. After 6 months of applications, he had no comedo-like lesion and then the patient was planned for surgical excision of the lesion.", "age": "[[14.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'46679': 1, '3973117': 1, '5667222': 1, '16441628': 1, '25657429': 2, '21595659': 1, '29440859': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4318035-1': 1}"}
