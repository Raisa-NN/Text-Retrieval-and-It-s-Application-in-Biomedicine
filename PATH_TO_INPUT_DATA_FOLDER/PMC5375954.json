She also complained of recent headaches that were worse upon wakening. The headaches had begun two months earlier and were treated with over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines. She was on no medications and had a surgical history of tonsillectomy at the age of six years. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head was obtained to evaluate intracranial anatomy. This revealed a large mass (1.2 x 2.3 cm) in the midline and seemingly, within the superior sagittal sinus (Figures -). A magnetic resonance venography (MRV) scan (Figure ) demonstrated a large punched out defect in the superior sagittal sinus at the junction of its posterior two thirds and anterior one third. An abnormal and large cortical vein was noted on the left side that traveled parallel to the superior sagittal sinus. The cortical vein drained the left frontal region up to the frontal pole and at its drainage into the superior sagittal sinus, made an unusual loop before entry. The superior sagittal sinus just posterior to the midline defect was slightly enlarged. The large defect was diagnosed as an extremely enlarged AG. There were no other intracranial variants appreciated. Follow-up imaging at one year demonstrated no change in the size of the AG, and at that time, the patient\u2019s headaches had resolved and no further syncopal episodes had been experienced.", "age": "[[16.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26226980': 1, '24948506': 1, '24976198': 1, '20938775': 1, '19096547': 1, '16908565': 1, '33635406': 1, '18417601': 1, '20581064': 1, '33532137': 1, '8730187': 1, '28409066': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
