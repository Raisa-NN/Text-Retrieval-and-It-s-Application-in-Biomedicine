On digital rectal examination, two lumina were palpable with an intervening septum. Barium enema showed long segment colonic duplication with distal communication just above anal verge []. Colonoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging revealed similar findings. Meckel's scan for ectopic gastric mucosa was negative. On exploratory laparotomy, complete colonic duplication from cecum till 2 cm proximal to anal verge was observed []. Both the lumens were of the same caliber and appearance. On gross examination, it was difficult to identify the normal colon and duplication. The common wall between the two was divided at the distal end using a stapling device inserted through the anus. Postoperatively, the complaints were relieved. The child was asymptomatic at last follow-up, 1 year postoperatively.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'33950968': 2, '26166987': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8104209-1': 1}"}
