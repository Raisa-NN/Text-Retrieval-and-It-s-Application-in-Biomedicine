Of relevance to this case, she had a right total hip replacement and an ipsilateral distal femoral replacement.\\nShe subsequently sustained a periprosthetic fracture at the distal tip of her right total hip replacement (Fig. ). An initial attempt was made to manage this fracture with a plate and Dall-Miles cables (Fig. ); however, the fracture did not unite. The patient went on to have a custom-made cement-linked internal proximal femoral replacement, which had a hollow cylindrical design to accept the stem of the existing well-fixed distal femoral component (Figs and ). This linked prosthesis effectively converted her separate prostheses to a total femoral replacement, sparing her distal femoral replacement from revision. She had no problems postoperatively and recovered well from her surgery.\\nShe remained well for 5 years, until she was referred back to our joint reconstruction unit due to a stress fracture in the stem of the distal femoral component, just below the junction with the cement-linked internal proximal femoral replacement (Fig. ).\\nAfter careful assessment of the radiographs and taking into consideration the complex nature of her failed salvage implant, a plan was made to design another custom-made component, this time a revision distal femoral prosthesis with a hollow cylindrical section to accept the existing, well-fixed salvage proximal femoral replacement.\\nThe prosthesis was designed using preoperative long-leg calibrated measurement radiographs and manufactured using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacture (CAD\u2013CAM) techniques by Stanmore Implants Worldwide. The implant had a rotating hinge knee component and was made from a combination of hydroxyapatite-coated and silver (Agluna)-treated Cobalt\u2013Chromium\u2013Molybdenum (Co\u2013Cr\u2013Mo) and Titanium\u20136Alumunium\u20134Vanadium (Ti\u20136Al\u20134V) alloys.\\nThe operation was carried out by the senior author and the customized distal femoral prosthesis was successfully cemented over the pre-existing internal proximal femoral replacement (Figs and ).\\nPostoperatively, the patient was advised to partially weight-bear with crutches and made a good recovery. She was discharged home 4 days post-surgery and is now 2 months post-operation. Her knee is flexing beyond 100\u00b0, which is more than she was able to achieve preoperatively and she has been cleared to fully weight-bear and return to her work as a solicitor.", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16446185': 1, '29158650': 1, '21368074': 1, '17012417': 1, '23648107': 1, '26781449': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
