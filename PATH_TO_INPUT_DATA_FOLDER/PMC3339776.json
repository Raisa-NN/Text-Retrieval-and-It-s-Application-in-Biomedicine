On physical examination, a vague tender mass was palpable from the right upper abdomen.\\nPlain radiograph of the abdomen revealed calculi of varying sizes in the right renal area with increased lucency in the area of renal density; with obscured renal outline. Ultrasound revealed parenchymal atrophy with few echogenic calculi and hyper echoic tissue surrounding the renal parenchyma on right side. Unenhanced CT scan [] revealed severe right renal parenchymal atrophy and multiple calculi. There was extensive fatty infiltration replacing the kidney, nearly filling the right abdominal cavity. MR findings revealed severe renal parenchymal atrophy, replaced by the adipose tissue. T2-weighted [half Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo-spin echo (HASTE)] sequence [] revealed simple cysts in left kidney, minimal right perirenal fluid collection with fatty replacement of kidney. On dynamic MR urography [], nonfunctioning of right kidney was demonstrated. After nephrectomy, histopathology of the lesion confirmed replacement of renal parenchyma with fat.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11960231': 1, '15010121': 1, '16153545': 1, '30302433': 1, '6878703': 1, '418645': 1, '15673533': 1, '22557731': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
