Biochemical tests indicated data on the following fasting blood sugar (FBS): 370 mg/dl, hemoglobin A1c: 11%). The patient was hospitalized for intravenous (IV) insulin infusion therapy (0.1 U/kg/h). Brain MRI study with multiplanar images revealed only a few periventricular and deep white matter hyperintense foci. These were compatible with ischemic changes. Grey matter signal, cerebral ventricles, major intracranial vessels, basal ganglia and brain stem were normal. Opacification of paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity was seen due to sinusitis, mostly on the right side with extension to right orbit. Due to involvement of fundus of right orbit and optic nerve, infection due to fungus origin was suggested. Fortunately, invasion to brain vessels was not seen. Cochleate-amphotericin B (1 mg/kg/day) was prescribed for him and maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were debrided. A biopsy specimen from maxillary sinus was taken. Hematoxylin and eosin stain displayed broad aseptate hyphae with right angles in the background of necrotic debris, but in this case, the isolate did not grow on the synthetic media. In consequence of orbit involvement, right eye enucleation was carried out. After 40 days, posaconazole (5 mg/kg) was added to his antifungal regimen, and the patient was discharged after 15 days ().", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22701840': 1, '14748801': 1, '34022619': 1, '16960917': 1, '20228503': 1, '19721767': 1, '22247442': 1, '24075351': 1, '27272179': 1, '34367936': 1, '24498504': 2, '34009676': 1, '26644901': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4649276-1': 2, '4649276-2': 2, '3898454-1': 1}"}
