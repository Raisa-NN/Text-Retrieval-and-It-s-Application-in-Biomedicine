She had a neutrophil leukocytosis (15.85 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL) and an increased C-reactive protein (176 mg/L).\\nAfter obtaining informed consent, the patient performed the 2D-TTE which showed the presence of a rounded hyperechogenic mass (diameter 35 mm \u00d7 35 mm) at the right atrium roof likely referred to the stent and the CVC coming from the SVC [].\\nThe TEE examination confirmed the diagnosis of the hemodialysis CVC hidden in the SVC stent since it raised from the SVC [].\\nAt the end, 3D-TEE was the really useful diagnostic tool showing the scaffold of the SVC stent partially dislocated in the right atrium []. The hemodialysis CVC, placed inside the SVC stent, showed irregular and augmented thickness (14 mm) of its surface referable to endocarditis vegetations []. Therefore, three hemocultures were performed from CVC and resulted positive for Staphylococcus aureus.\\nThe patient was treated with antibiotic therapy (daptomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) and after 4 weeks of treatment, she underwent CVC extraction.", "age": "[[77.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15080528': 1, '21867833': 1, '28465951': 1, '27762247': 1, '15370655': 1, '22317840': 1, '1781814': 1, '20688767': 1, '16004890': 1, '20048212': 1, '26320109': 1, '17336761': 1, '8205682': 1, '22968846': 1, '16365367': 1, '29911010': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
