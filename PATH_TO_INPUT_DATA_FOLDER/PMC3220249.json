Maternal serum screening demonstrated a very low estriol level of 0.06 multiples of the median (MoM) with low alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level, 0.6 MoM and 0.52 MoM, respectively, which were interpreted as a high risk of Edward syndrome (1 : 79) and Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome (1 : 7)., The karyotype by amniocentesis was 46,XX. Level II ultrasonography after 21 weeks' gestation demonstrated no structural abnormalities including the adrenal glands and genitalia. Upon reevaluation of family history, however, the parents revealed that their 27-month-old first baby had been diagnosed with CLAH. The first baby was delivered vaginally at 36+2 weeks' gestation with birth weight 2,360 g. Initial symptoms included projectile vomiting and poor oral intake, with lethargy and hyperpigmentaion 10 weeks after birth. The initial laboratory finding demonstrated hyponatremia (125 mEq/L) and hyperkalemia (6.6 mEq/L). Basal adrenal hormone levels and an adrenocoticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test showed a severe deficiency of adrenal hormones (). Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) demonstrated diffusely enlarged adrenal glands with markedly low density. Gene analysis revealed a normal CYP21A2 gene sequence but a homozygous mutation c.772C>T in exon 7 of StAR. She was diagnosed with CLAH and treated with stress doses of hydrocortisone and 1036mineralocorticoid, which were tapered to a maintenance dose.\\nTherefore, prenatal testing was performed in the second sibling for the relevant disease-causing mutation from fetal cells by amniocentesis. Exon 7 and its adjacent intronic sequences were amplified by PCR, using forward primer 5'-CCTGGCAGCCTGTTTGTGATAG-3' and reverse primer 5'-ATGAGCGTGTGTACCAGTGCAG-3', which revealed a homozygous c.772C>T substitution resulting in a glycine to stop codon substitution at amino acid 258 (). A 2,665 g female baby was delivered vaginally with Apgar scores of 7 and 9 at 40 weeks' gestation. At birth, the baby presented with normal female external genitalia. Screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia was normal, 17\u03b1-OH progesterone (17\u03b1-OHP) 8.33 ng/mL (normal 1.7-25.0 ng/mL). There were no clinical signs or symptoms until 3 months after birth. Four months after birth, the second baby was admitted to our hospital with vomiting and diarrhea after DTaP vaccination. Her laboratory profile was similar to that of her sister, but without enlargement of adrenal glands on ultrasonography (). Genetic evaluation from the peripheral blood confirmed the same mutation. She was diagnosed with CLAH and discharged on the 9th day of hospitalization after treatment of mineralocorticoid and hydrocortisone.", "age": "[[33.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8948562': 1, '8052574': 1, '24265530': 1, '7829612': 1, '10599737': 1, '11942534': 1, '12970278': 1, '11061515': 1, '150559': 1, '17433772': 1, '16104669': 1, '9829224': 1, '7892608': 1, '10022408': 1, '11344930': 1, '18058976': 1, '9097960': 1, '22891154': 2, '11943798': 1, '22028173': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3415193-1': 1}"}
