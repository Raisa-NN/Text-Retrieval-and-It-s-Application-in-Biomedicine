The right adrenal tumor was found incidentally on a routine medical examination in 1997. There was no family history of any endocrine pathology and she did not present with any symptoms of palpitations, diaphoresis or flushing. Laboratory examinations revealed that the urinary vanilinmandelic acid, catecholamine and cortisol levels all were within normal limits (see Table \\n).\\nThe preoperative abdominal CT scan demonstrated a well-circumscribed, solid right adrenal mass measuring 88 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 90 mm. Based on the above findings, the primary diagnosis was non-functional adrenal carcinoma. Subsequently, an open total left adrenalectomy was performed and no lymphadenopathy was seen. On gross examination the tumor was a well-circumscribed solid mass. The histological appearance, together with the immunophenotype of this tumor, was consistent with the diagnosis of cystic lymphangioma-like AT of the adrenal gland (Figures \\n and\\n).", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27672642': 2, '15692945': 1, '22457682': 1, '14639487': 1, '3178432': 1, '26223194': 1, '11969056': 1, '27920990': 1, '17293927': 1, '17102111': 1, '24084253': 1, '11583293': 1, '6766032': 1, '22048963': 1, '8279629': 1, '1110583': 1, '21151721': 1, '34976833': 2, '9425401': 1, '1275056': 1, '30139816': 1, '20924994': 1, '23638228': 1, '32417730': 1, '25487416': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4295261-1': 2, '5018624-1': 1, '8716616-1': 1}"}
