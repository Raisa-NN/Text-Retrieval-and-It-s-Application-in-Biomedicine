He had well-compensated heart failure following biventricular defibrillator insertion in 2007. His intrathoracic impedance measurements and T-wave alternans tests were normal at baseline () until March 3, 2011, when he had a heart failure exacerbation. Vital signs included blood pressure of 100/60, pulse 88, and respiratory rate 20/minute. Weight was 175 pounds, and physical exam revealed clear lungs but peripheral edema and ascites. Brain natriuretic peptide measurement (1854 pg/mL) was consistent with fluid overload, and intrathoracic impedance measurements dropped with resultant increased fluid index (Figures and ). T-wave alternans was markedly positive with sustained alternans present at an onset heart rate of less than 105 bpm (Figures and ). The patient was given daily doses of 80 mg intravenous furosemide until he reached his baseline weight of 168 pounds, with restoration of normal clinical status. Three weeks later, intrathoracic impedance measurements and T-wave alternans tests returned to normal ().", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12021226': 1, '16750691': 1, '16412847': 1, '16061743': 1, '16412877': 1, '11127468': 1, '19022157': 1, '17084280': 1, '11518193': 1, '10070212': 1, '10077525': 1, '17158246': 1, '19187920': 1, '17132786': 1, '22051334': 1, '24826235': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
