She was initiated on ART (AZT-3TC-NVP) and CPT 2 years later with a CD4+ count 119 cells/mm3. The ART regimen was shifted to TDF-3TC-DTG after 11 years as recommended by the National Comprehensive HIV Care Guideline. She was diagnosed to have DKA with clinical evidence of polyuria, polydipsia and fatigue, severe hyperglycemia (RBS=350\u2013450 mg/dl, HbA1c=11.4%) and ketonuria (3+), which occurred after 1 month of the DTG-based ART regimen (). No documented preceding infections. No personal or family history of diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia. Serum C-peptide level, anti-insulin antibody or anti-GAD antibody were not determined due to limited clinical setup. No documented plasma glucose level prior to changing ART regimen. She was treated with intravenous fluids, regular insulin and IV KCl, and recovered from diabetic ketoacidosis after 3 days of admission. NPH insulin 10/8 IU s/c daily was initiated, which later changed to metformin 750 mg po daily. Good glycemic control (FBS=106\u2013140 mg/day, HbA1c=5.6%) was obtained with metformin, while the DTG-based ART regimen was continued.", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'32105626': 1, '30503325': 1, '23306000': 1, '34774018': 1, '33061662': 1, '24446523': 1, '29637535': 1, '29077869': 1, '33380904': 1, '27733708': 1, '24195548': 1, '23830355': 1, '34349567': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8326784-1': 2, '8326784-2': 2}"}
