Examination revealed splenomegaly. Haemoglobin was 113 g/L (11.3 g/dL), WBC 17 \u00d7 109/L (17 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL), PLT 676 \u00d7 109/L (676 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL); plasma creatinine 101.6 \u03bcmol/L (1.15 mg/dL); eGFR 1.01 mL/s (61 mL/min) and lactate dehydrogenase 1394U/L. Abdominal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a perirenal infiltrating tissue associated with hepatosplenomegaly. Given the suspicion of lymphoma, the patient performed an osteomedullary biopsy that showed idiopathic myelofibrosis. A CT () confirmed bilateral perirenal tissue with modest contrastographic impregnation and showed a solid mass in the lower pole of the right kidney with intense contrast enhancement. The patient was referred to us for a CT-guided needle biopsy that revealed the co-presence of two different lesions to the right a clear cell renal carcinoma, while the bilateral perirenal tissue was haematopoietic tissue, confirmed by immunohistochemical cell phenotype. The patient underwent a polar right nephrectomy and he is still alive 24 months after diagnosis with a minor renal dysfunction, plasma creatinine 114.9 \u03bcmol/L (1.3 mg/dL) and eGFR 0.88 mL/s (53 mL/min).", "age": "[[79.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20667923': 1, '16183437': 1, '16978988': 1, '10648678': 1, '16215320': 1, '20949474': 1, '11176408': 1, '18649005': 1, '34376955': 1, '16307541': 1, '26120442': 2, '15790723': 1, '29497517': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5783215-1': 2, '4438414-1': 1}"}
