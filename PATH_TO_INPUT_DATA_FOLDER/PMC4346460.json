Pre-operative doppler ultrasonography demonstrated a normal portal vein. A partial obstruction in vena cava was observed with complete obstruction of the hepatic veins due to thrombosis. Furthermore, extensive ascites was observed. CT demonstrated partial thrombus between the IVC and right atrium; hepatic veins could not be observed. A right liver lobe was donated by the patient\u2019s mother.\\nDuring recipient operation, extensive ascites was observed. Total hepatectomy was performed for the congested and granular liver with preservation of retro-hepatic IVC. The IVC was fibrotic and occluded (). The supra- and infra-segments of IVC were clamped. Distal clamp was placed superior to the renal veins; below and proximal clamp was at the level of right atrium. The IVC segment between the clamps was fully mobilized and resected. Reconstruction was performed with IVC graft stored in deep freeze (). The atrio-caval and cava-caval anastomosis were performed. Right hepatic vein of the right liver graft was anastomosed end-to-side to the IVC graft (). Post-operative course was uneventful. Post-operative imaging demonstrated patent IVC graft, hepatic vein and artery.", "age": "[[15.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22841264': 1, '27787368': 1, '24584043': 1, '23701155': 1, '16939520': 1, '19408072': 1, '28208936': 1, '20430186': 1, '25737776': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
