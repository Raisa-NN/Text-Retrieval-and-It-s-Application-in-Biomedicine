He was wearing reinforced work boots, and, during the fall, he struck one tree branch with the plantar aspect of his right forefoot before landing on the ground and falling on his back. At examination in the local Accident and Emergency Department, he referred pain and tenderness over the posterior aspect of the ankle, and swelling was noted posteromedially. At palpation, there was tenderness four centimetres above the insertion of the Achilles tendon on the calcaneal tuberosity, a two centimetre gap in the Achilles tendon was present, and the calf squeeze test was positive for a subcutaneous Achilles tendon rupture []. Plain radiographs revealed an undisplaced fracture of the medial malleolus (Fig ). Both lesions wee further confirmed by a magnetic resonance scan performed for scientific documentation (Fig ).\\nThe patient initially elected to be managed conservatively, and received an above knee plaster of Paris cast with the foot in maximal equines. He was kept non-weight bearing for one week, and was referred to our unit, where he was seen after two weeks following the original injury. At that time, the above clinical findings were confirmed, and the patient requested to undergo surgery.\\nAt surgery, the patient was placed prone on a fracture table in a bloodless field furnished by a thigh tourniquet. The medial malleolar fracture was visualised under image intensifier: it was undisplaced, and it was decided to manage it conservatively if still undisplaced by the end of the Achilles tendon repair. The tendon was exposed using a slightly curvilinear medial approach. An end-to-end repair was performed using a single modified Kessler suture with No 1 Vicryl (Polyglactin 910 braided absorbable suture, Johnson & Johnson, European Logistics Centre, 66 Rue de la Fusee, B-1130 Bruxelles, Belgium). A running circumferential suture with 3-0 Vicryl reinforced the core suture. The repair was thicker than the original tendon, and the paratenon could not be sutured over it. Continuous 4-0 Vicryl reabsorbable sutures were used for the subcutaneous fat, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 4-0 Vicryl reabsorbable suture. At the end of the procedure, the fracture of the medial malleolus was undisplaced, and it was decided to leave it alone. The skin wound was dressed with gauze, sterile plaster wool was applied, followed by a below knee synthetic cast without increasing the natural minimal equinus of the ankle.\\nWhen the cast had dried, the patient was encouraged to mobilise with the use of crutches, under the direction of a physiotherapist. The patient was discharged the day after the operation. He was allowed to bear weight on the tip toes of the operated leg as tolerated, but was told to keep the leg elevated as much as possible for the first two post-operative weeks. Two weeks after the operation, a synthetic anterior below knee slab was applied, with the ankle in the natural minimal equinus. The synthetic slab was secured to the leg with three or four removable Velcro (Velcro USA Inc., Manchester, NH, USA) straps for four weeks. The patient was encouraged to weight bear on the operated limb as soon as he felt comfortable, and to gradually progress to full weight bearing. The patient was seen by a trained physiotherapist who taught him gentle mobilisation exercises of the ankle, isometric contraction of the gastrosoleus complex, and gentle concentric contraction of the calf muscles. The patient was encouraged to perform mobilisation of the involved ankle several times per day after unstrapping the two most distal Velcro straps. The patient was given an appointment six weeks from the operation, when the anterior slab was removed [].\\nAt that time, the fracture site was not painful, the patient was able to fully weight bear and started more intensive physiotherapy. At the 12 month follow up, the patient was asymptomatic with a full range of active and passive ankle motion. The patient was able to walk on tip toes unaided, and had returned to his occupation as a tree surgeon. He reported that, following a full day at work, his ankle at times swelled up, though the swelling had resolved by the following morning. He was discharged from further follow up, and, on telephone questioning two years following the injury, he reported to be leading a normal life.", "age": "[[38.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'28607787': 2, '8775706': 1, '12596644': 1, '9506804': 1, '9524518': 1, '8368428': 1, '11972082': 1, '7787984': 1, '3757366': 1, '13453094': 1, '10512344': 1, '602490': 1, '30310845': 1, '32095294': 2, '12975188': 1, '13879845': 1, '11008868': 1, '16872521': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7036116-1': 1, '5457752-1': 1}"}
