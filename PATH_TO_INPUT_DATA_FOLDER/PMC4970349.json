As the baby did not cry at birth, resuscitation with bag and tube was attempted. Failing to visualize the vocal cords, the esophagus was promptly intubated and the baby was gently ventilated before being put on invasive ventilation. RDS evident on X-ray [] was treated by giving natural bovine surfactant resulting in X-ray improvement and improvement in saturations. The baby also had an imperforate anus, a patent ductus arteriosus of 2 mm with a structurally normal heart and a solitary right-sided kidney. The baby continued to do well on gentle invasive ventilation, maintaining saturations above 90%. A colostomy was performed on the baby. Although CT could not be done, the dye study delineated the anatomic defect []. Considering the complex nature of the problems and the interventions there on, parents refused to continue further management. The baby succumbed to an evolving pneumonia on day 8 of life.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26665117': 1, '20494075': 1, '21918809': 2, '13945641': 1, '10549768': 1, '23901199': 1, '21303850': 1, '27424553': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4970349-1': 2, '3284653-1': 1}"}
