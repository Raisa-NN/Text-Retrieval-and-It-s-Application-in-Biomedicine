Post-transplant baseline creatinine was ~1.5 mg/dL. Doppler ultrasonography of the allograft done in the emergency department demonstrated a single renal artery with slight blunting of the systolic upstroke, but otherwise unremarkable flow (Figure A). There was no evidence of renal infarction and the resistive indices were within normal limits. His blood pressure was well controlled and was admitted for further work up. As the renal function failed to improve with supportive measures, a biopsy of the allograft was performed, which showed no evidence of acute rejection or tubular injury (Figure B). A carbon dioxide (CO2) angiogram of the pelvic and renal arteries was performed, which revealed two separate renal arteries anastomosed to the right external iliac artery (Figure C). There was good flow through the lower pole renal transplant artery with minimal pressure gradient across the anastomosis but the upper pole artery demonstrated >75% stenosis (Figure D) with a significant pressure gradient of 107 mm Hg. The gradient reduced to 21 mm Hg after successful balloon angioplasty. The patient's serum creatinine improved back to the baseline value of 1.5 mg/dL at 1-week follow-up.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30214795': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
