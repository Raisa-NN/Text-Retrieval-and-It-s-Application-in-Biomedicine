Fifteen days before admission, the patient had developed a sudden pain in right upper quadrant and felt discomfort while working in the field. The pain was persistent, but no other symptoms such as fever, acid reflux or diarrhoea were found. After admission, relevant examinations were completed. The eosinophil count was significantly increased (2.68 \u00d7 109/l; 0.02 \u00d7 109/l < normal < 0.52 \u00d7 109/l), while other laboratory tests showed no obvious abnormalities. His computed tomography (CT) findings presented as a multiple patchy space occupying the right lobe of the liver and local effusion under the right capsule of the liver (). Following consideration of the patient's imaging findings and medical history, it was thought that the patient might have hepatocellular carcinoma with rupture and haemorrhage. The patient underwent right hemihepatectomy under laparoscopy + cholecystectomy + regional lymph node dissection. Intraoperatively, extensive adhesions were found around the right liver and rupture of the right hepatophrenic plain was observed. The postoperative liver specimen was dissected from multiple sides and a haemorrhagic area of 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2 cm was located below the liver capsule; and a 5 \u00d7 3.2 cm grey mass with soft section surface was observed below the haemorrhagic area (). The pathological diagnosis of the postoperative liver specimen was hepatic paragonimiasis (). In the following days, the patient recovered well without complications. He was treated with 25 mg/kg praziquantel orally three times a day for 3 days after discharge with good efficacy.
