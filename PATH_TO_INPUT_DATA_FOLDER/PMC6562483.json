The patient felt pain in her jaw, which was the chief complaint when she presented to the emergency department. Upon neurological assessment, the patient complained of midline tenderness from the skull base to midline cervical spine over C3; denied headaches, changes in vision, speech or swallowing, extremity weakness or paresthesias. A maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan did not show evidence of an acute facial fracture. However, the CT scan did reveal a radiolucent, ovoid-shaped lytic lesion arising in the left lateral mass of C1, between the anterior tubercle and the transverse process. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies further confirmed an enhancing osseous lesion at the left lateral mass of C1, with cortical breach and extension into the left lateral atlantodental joint space (). Of note, three years prior, patient had a CT cervical spine which, upon retrospective review, demonstrated a similar but much smaller lesion.\\nDifferential diagnoses underlying this vertebral cortical erosion included those of infectious etiology, as well as oncologic lesions, such as giant cell tumor of bone, aneurysmal bone cyst, osteoblastoma, osteosarcoma or even Langerhans histiocytosis (LCH). Oncology recommended that the cervical spine lesion be biopsied for tissue diagnosis. Due to the unusual location of the lesion and risk of locally aggressive pathology, or possible tumor seeding along the biopsy track, interventional radiology was unable to perform a CT guided needle biopsy. It was therefore decided that the patient would require open neurosurgical biopsy for diagnosis.\\nDue to the anterior and lateral location of the vertebral lesion, an anterior transoral approach to the C1 lesion was performed, in order to obtain a sufficient amount of the contrast enhancing component of the mass for pathologic diagnosis. The transoral approach was performed in a multidisciplinary fashion, during which the otolaryngology team used direct visualization, as well as stereotactic navigation, to expose the C1 anterior tubercle on the left side. Once exposure was completed, neurosurgery team utilized a matchstick burr to then drill the anterior outer cortex of C1. Multiple specimens from the fibrous tumor were taken, with curettes and pituitary forceps.\\nThe sampled tissue did not show features of osteoblastoma or osteosarcoma, nor were there features of LCH or signs of infection. In the sampled region, the lesion consisted of a proliferation of nondescript stromal cells with intermixed multinucleated giant cells, and occasional clusters of foamy histiocytes (). Special testing for giant cell tumor of bone (G34W staining) was negative, as was fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing for Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 6 (USP6), making a primary form of aneurysmal bone cyst unlikely. However, due to the aggressive nature of the patient\u2019s osteolytic lesion and the significant risk for atlantoaxial instability associated with its location, it was decided to start the patient on Denosumab. Denosumab is an osteoclast inhibiting pharmaceutical agent, which was administered to the patient in order to stabilize and consolidate the lesion. Samples of the patient\u2019s lesion were also sent out to a nationally recognized expert bone pathologist, whose findings were most consistent with benign giant cell rich lesion with histiocytes.\\nThe patient was re-assessed three months postoperatively and MRI studies revealed that there was no interval decrease in the size of the tumor. In fact, there was a slight progression of the lesion anteriorly, despite treatment with Denosumab. After presenting the patient\u2019s case at our institution\u2019s multidisciplinary tumor board, it was decided to offer the patient a gross total resection of the offending lesion. This would inherently lead to significant atlantoaxial instability, therefore a posterior occiput to cervical three instrumented fusion was also warranted.\\nThe transoral approach was performed in a multidisciplinary fashion, during which the otolaryngology team used direct visualization as well as stereotactic navigation, to expose the cervical vertebrae through the posterior pharynx. Fibrous tumor was identified and dissected until superior, inferior, and lateral margins of tumor resection were confirmed grossly, with fluoroscopy, and neuronavigation. Additional C1 anterior tubercle eccentric towards the right side was also taken, to include a normal bony margin. A small rim of tumor adherent to the vertebral artery was left behind. After the otolaryngology team closed the posterior pharynx, the patient was carefully turned prone, maintaining spinal precautions. Base of the occiput to cervical three was then exposed. C2 pedicle screws were placed. C3 lateral mass screws were placed. An occipital plate was sized. Screws into the occiput were placed. Fluoroscopy confirmed excellent position and spinal alignment. There were no post-operative complications and the patient was discharged home in good condition. Pathologic examination of the resected material at this time showed complete disappearance of the giant cells, due to Denosumab therapy, with the remaining lesional tissue resembling benign fibrous histiocytoma (). Post-operative imaging studies revealed a stable posterior cervical spine construct, along with minimal rim-enhancement along the vertebral artery, as expected (). At a three-week follow up visit in clinic, the patient\u2019s incisions were healing well, she was neurologically intact, tolerating regular diet, and was eager to return to school.", "age": "[[15.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'6485370': 1, '8613848': 1, '22124421': 1, '8625594': 1, '12232551': 1, '24549386': 1, '31991564': 1, '14749514': 1, '26384486': 1, '27476845': 1, '175701': 1, '25558326': 1, '11466720': 1, '17272426': 1, '22058600': 1, '17627144': 1, '9460152': 1, '16044344': 1, '20644431': 1, '3980496': 1, '681419': 1, '4018962': 1, '16481964': 1, '1625013': 1, '31071908': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
