As in Case 1, laboratory tests revealed no signs of a chronic or neoplastic condition and no endocrine abnormalities. Ultrasound study evidenced an ill-defined heterogeneous echotexture mass 26 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 10 mm in diameter ().\\nThe area of enlargement blended into the normal labial tissue, and there was no definable capsule. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed these findings, namely, asymmetrical mildly enlarged labial tissue composed of homogeneous hypointense signal on T1-weighted imaging and hypo- to isointense to muscle on T2-weighted images.\\nHistopathological examination was performed after bioptic sampling evidencing normal constituents of vulvar soft tissue, including fibroblast, collagen, adipose tissue, blood vessels and nerves compatible with CALME (). The immunohistochemistry results were positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors. No evidence of recurrence was found at follow-up visits performed at 1 and 6 months after surgical excision.", "age": "[[6.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19345909': 1, '10869967': 1, '34824986': 1, '19620556': 1, '2657620': 1, '26867607': 1, '16208476': 1, '20226740': 1, '15577679': 1, '23341392': 1, '19853747': 1, '17601903': 1, '21918047': 1, '16006794': 1, '30029490': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6069501-1': 2}"}
