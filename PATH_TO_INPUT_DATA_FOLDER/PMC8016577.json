Her pain was not aggravated by any food. She had labs, abdominal US and CT scan, and EGD, which were all normal. She had a gallbladder EF of 91% on the HIDA scan with no onset or aggravation of her pain during the scan. She underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which revealed a grossly normal gallbladder. The pathology revealed features of chronic cholecystitis. The patient had complete resolution of her symptoms. She remained symptom free when contacted six months later for follow-up.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8755579': 1, '8273847': 1, '14769306': 1, '18543048': 1, '24581761': 1, '24069981': 1, '20824367': 1, '30209609': 1, '53500': 1, '18992594': 1, '22648109': 1, '7573441': 1, '10670853': 1, '12358231': 1, '33833891': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8016577-1': 2, '8016577-2': 2}"}
