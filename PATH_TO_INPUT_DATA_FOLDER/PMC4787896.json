The lesion had appeared 3 years earlier and had gradually enlarged. Physical examination revealed a hard, dome-shaped nodule of normal skin color to reddish color on the left groin area. The nodule was 2 cm in diameter. Ulceration with crust was observed at the center of the nodule (fig. ). Detailed medical history analysis revealed a history of excisions of multiple ondontogenic keratocysts from the mandible, and at age 16, falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli calcification. Multiple palmar and plantar pits were seen.\\nWe suspected nevoid basal carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS; Gorlin syndrome) and performed mutation detection. Mutation analysis of genomic DNA demonstrated the patient to be heterozygous for the mutation c.1364dupT (p.T456NfsX41) in PTCH1, a gene that functions in tumor suppression. The groin region had not been exposed to radiation or arsenic ingestion. She had no history of BCC.\\nSurgical excision was performed. The histopathologic findings under hematoxylin-eosin stain showed alveolar structures of various sizes, with basaloid tumor cells (fig. ). Characteristic peripheral palisading patterns were observed as well (fig. ). The histopathology was consistent with BCC.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9096761': 1, '13851319': 1, '8326488': 1, '7712637': 1, '22246785': 1, '17139991': 1, '8042673': 1, '1347096': 1, '8599733': 1, '26997948': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
