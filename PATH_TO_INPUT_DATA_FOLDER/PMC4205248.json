An aneurysm at the ophthalmic segment measuring 4.5 mm in its greatest dimension was observed on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (), however, ophthalmic examination did not uncover any abnormal findings. The patient underwent uneventful coil embolization without stent deployment. After embolization, the patient was discharged without symptoms or complications, and she noticed alleviation of her previous symptoms. Post-embolization DSA showed () that the distal flow of the left ophthalmic artery was preserved, and the aneurysm sac was not filled with contrast medium.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20970345': 1, '16546392': 1, '15912157': 1, '10719864': 1, '8059647': 1, '11152364': 1, '12924695': 1, '11136984': 1, '20860951': 1, '21273934': 1, '19240558': 1, '22898891': 1, '16060237': 1, '12823869': 1, '17564166': 1, '632877': 1, '12775880': 1, '11546888': 1, '9282843': 1, '3418385': 1, '22173755': 1, '15876983': 1, '9870810': 1, '29526058': 1, '8151343': 1, '22381310': 1, '27066815': 1, '18647492': 1, '20559090': 1, '15361819': 1, '10321876': 1, '10337416': 1, '11841724': 1, '19242564': 1, '2324793': 1, '18518728': 1, '20934156': 1, '25340024': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4205248-1': 2}"}
