The patient was under treatment for schizophrenia but not taking medications regularly. Physical examination revealed an afebrile patient with tachycardia and tachypnea. The abdomen was soft but distended. A mass was palpable in the epigastrium being dull to percussion. Plain radiograph of the abdomen showed multiple objects of metal density contained within the stomach (Fig. ).\\nThe patient was admitted and upper GI endoscopy was attempted to remove the FB but failed due to enormous size of bezoar. Open removal of the bezoar was then planned. At operation, a grossly dilated stomach found. Through a longitudinal gastrotomy multiple metal objects including: nails, copper wires, blade, screws, rubber bands, coins and the remains of partially digested food (measuring about half kilograms) were removed. The stomach was repaired in a double layer fashion. Rest of the GIT was normal. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient was discharged and transferred to a psychiatric facility 7 days after surgery.", "age": "[[17.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11931215': 1, '15462159': 1, '16546027': 1, '10232288': 1, '28954757': 2, '19499681': 1, '17033575': 1, '22953273': 2, '7922045': 1, '22953281': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3418006-1': 1, '5747782-1': 1}"}
