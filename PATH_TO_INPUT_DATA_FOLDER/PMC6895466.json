No pulse was detected, and bystander CPR was started by a civil servant who was educated in basic life support. After electrical shock administered by an AED, spontaneous circulation was returned. When the patient arrived at the hospital, she was confused but cooperative, and ECG showed a sinus rhythm with T wave inversion of the inferior leads and prolonged QT interval. Frequent PVCs and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia were documented on Holter ECG. However, epinephrine challenge test showed a negative result. However, upon echocardiography, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with bileaflet MVP was found. The inferomedial papillary muscle was hypertrophied, and mitral annular disjunction and curling were also observed. There was no evidence of myocardial fibrosis on cardiac MR. Both patients were diagnosed with bileaflet MVP combined with ventricular fibrillation. They were fully recovered and discharged with \u03b2-blocker after placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.", "age": "[[33.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17140755': 1, '3554947': 1, '26160859': 1, '22294211': 1, '10423668': 1, '4058522': 1, '27516479': 1, '23563135': 1, '31743639': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6895466-1': 2}"}
