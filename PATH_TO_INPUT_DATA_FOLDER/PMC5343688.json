Intraoral examination showed retained 71, 81, and 83 and missing 22, 31, 41, and 43. Faciomaxillary and faciomandibular and maxillomandibular midlines were discordant. Molar relationship on both sides was Class I with increased overbite. Orthopantomogram of the patient showed missing 31 and 41 and Type 5 transmigration of 43 []. Patient was informed about the condition and advised fixed orthodontic treatment. The treatment plan was to start with nonextraction fixed orthodontic treatment to achieve levelling and alignment in the upper arch followed by creating space for the replacement of 22. In the lower arch, extraction of 71 and 81 was planned followed by the eruption of 43 in place of 71 and 81 facilitated by orthodontic treatment. This can be followed by reshaping of 43.", "age": "[[17.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12828443': 1, '23606992': 1, '22570797': 1, '9728151': 1, '3858781': 1, '18280946': 1, '3936805': 1, '32341702': 1, '7629344': 1, '6584826': 1, '8058903': 1, '9598609': 1, '12917287': 1, '22474648': 2, '26851148': 1, '13883048': 1, '30573722': 1, '14719743': 1, '9063209': 1, '1064653': 1, '6948576': 1, '22583586': 1, '5262845': 1, '17884533': 1, '14719741': 1, '26892206': 1, '23561418': 1, '11211293': 1, '24987621': 2, '16696892': 1, '24520309': 1, '17351688': 1, '26929701': 2, '12424633': 1, '11138644': 1, '5280055': 1, '24293948': 1, '8885455': 1, '31612084': 2, '25749110': 1, '19212522': 1, '21196850': 1, '26361803': 1, '24939311': 1, '20303046': 1, '24015012': 2, '23452974': 1, '9787542': 1, '21175032': 1, '7942658': 1, '8603306': 1, '15775953': 1, '27528105': 1, '3480720': 1, '28316943': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5343688-1': 2, '5343688-2': 2, '3314837-1': 1, '3314837-2': 1, '3314837-3': 1, '3314837-4': 1, '6755289-1': 1, '4072348-1': 1, '4745244-1': 1, '3757885-1': 1}"}
