This patient\u2019s history included a bare-metal stent implantation for a proximal LAD lesion 20 years previously. He had been discharged on acetyl salicylic acid; however, one month later, he discontinued antiplatelet medication and stopped attending his control visits.\\nThe electrocardiogram showed acute anterior myocardial infarction (), and an immediate coronary angiography showed total occlusion of the implanted stent in the proximal LAD (). Balloon angioplasty was therefore performed (Alvimedica balloon, 3 \u00d7 15 mm). TIMI 3 (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) coronary flow was achieved (); however, there appeared to be a need to perform percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for the diagonal coronary artery branch (Advancer Hp balloon, 2 \u00d7 15 mm). Plaques were found on the right and circumflex coronary arteries. Following the administration of a bolus, tirofiban infusion was initiated post-procedurally and was continued for 24 hours.\\nDuring the follow-up period, ST-segment resolution was achieved. Transthoracic echocardiography showed modest impairment of the left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 52%. On the sixth day after admission, this patient was discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy.", "age": "[[68.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17296821': 1, '17827826': 1, '29790037': 1, '19182301': 1, '17984377': 1, '17438147': 1, '11306525': 1, '19389558': 1, '20686289': 1, '17470709': 1, '32089898': 2, '19371823': 1, '12081992': 1, '26407330': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7026705-1': 1}"}
