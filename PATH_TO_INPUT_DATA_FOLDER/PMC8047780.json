The patient had a left sensory-motor deficit and speech impairment. The blood sample was taken 8 hours after a computed tomography angiography and thrombectomy. Serum protein electrophoresis was performed on CAPILLARYS 2 (Sebia, Lisses, France). A duplication of the \u03b2-2 globulin fraction (black arrow) with an increase in concentration to 7.4 g/L (reference interval: 2.3-4.7 g/L) and a shoulder of \u03b2-1 globulin (grey arrow) were detected compared to normal serum (). Other laboratory results were unremarkable ().
