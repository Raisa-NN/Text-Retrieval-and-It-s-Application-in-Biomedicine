In 1989, she presented a rectal adenocarcinoma T4N0M0 treated by surgery.\\nFifteen years later, the appearance of a left supra-clavicular lymph node justified a biopsy showing metastases of breast adenocarcinoma hormonal receptor negative and HER-2 protein positive (expression was +++) assessed by IHC. She had also infra and sub-diaphragmatic lymph node involvement. A progression was noted after 4 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 and Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 repeated every three weeks.\\nIn order to exclude an associated rectal recurrence, a biopsy of a retroperitoneal lymph node was programmed. Monotherapy by Trastuzumab 4 mg/kg intravenously was undertaken the day before biopsy. Anatomopathological analysis with IHC confirms breast origin and shows identical aspect with the left supra-clavicular lymph node but the HER-2 status was negative (expression was only +). Shortly after, the patient died due to progressive disease.", "age": "[[66.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18650259': 1, '11481385': 1, '11054438': 1, '15786420': 1, '18836203': 1, '9831867': 1, '3798106': 1, '18636112': 1, '11821453': 1, '7579499': 1, '12635131': 1, '19918269': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
