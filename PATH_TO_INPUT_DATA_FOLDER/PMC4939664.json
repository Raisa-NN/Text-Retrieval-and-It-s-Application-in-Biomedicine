In an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy examination, a submucosal tumor was found in the antrum with partial ulceration on the surface. Gastroscopy revealed a 3.5 \u00d7 3.0 cm sessile polypoid mass with a smooth surface in the anterior wall of the gastric antrum with a recessed area. This area looked like mucosal ulceration covered with gastric mucosa. Endoscopic ultrasound examination revealed a focal hypoechoic lesion protruding into the lumen. We considered that this tumor was located in the muscle layer (fig. ). There were no malignant cells in biopsy.\\nThe CT scan showed a heterogeneous tumor in the gastric antrum, which was drastically enhanced with contrast medium, and consisted of a number of highly stained small nodules around the tumor rim (fig. ). There was no evidence of metastasis.\\nRadiological imaging suggested differential diagnoses of angioma and solitary fibromyxoma because of the hypervascular nature of the tumor. However, because the tumor did not protrude into the lumen of the stomach, these diagnoses were unlikely. Furthermore, the imaging findings ruled out the possibility of gastrointestinal stromal tumor.", "age": "[[39.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18074180': 1, '20712648': 1, '22134628': 1, '31360694': 1, '24551290': 1, '34369189': 2, '19675452': 1, '30653169': 1, '24160555': 1, '29384895': 1, '17460456': 1, '27462200': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8358512-1': 1, '8358512-2': 1}"}
