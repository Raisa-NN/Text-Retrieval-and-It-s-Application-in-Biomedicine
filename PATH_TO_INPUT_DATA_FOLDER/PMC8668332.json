His father, hospitalized for a fourth recurrence of C. difficile colitis after multiple failed antibiotic courses, was referred for FMT. As part of routine screening to evaluate his suitability as a donor, the son's HIV p24 antigen returned positive. The son was informed of his positive result by medical staff and was referred to infectious diseases without counseling. The son was in a monogamous relationship with his wife and had no risk factors for HIV infection. Confirmatory testing using a Multispot HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay returned as negative, and subsequent HIV viral load was negative. The son was then counseled that he had a false-positive HIV test by an infectious diseases physician.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'28129018': 1, '31665572': 1, '28707337': 1, '31379333': 1, '29208562': 1, '29562266': 1, '25714160': 1, '31472233': 1, '30154172': 1, '28077694': 1, '20685938': 1, '28087657': 1, '30181015': 1, '28672282': 1, '34912583': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
