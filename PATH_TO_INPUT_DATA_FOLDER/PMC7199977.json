Her symptoms worsened over the last 6 months and the degree of dyspnea on admission corresponded to New York Heart Association class II-III. She also suffered from type 2 diabetes and non-regular hypertension. Upon physical examination, her blood pressure was 155/95 mmHg, heart rate was 78 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 91%. She also had an early diastolic murmur at the right sternal border. Laboratory findings were within normal limits. The electrocardiogram showed nonspecific T-wave changes. Chest X-ray demonstrated a widened mediastinum (). Transthoracic echocardiography showed an ascending aortic aneurysm and the modified apical 5-chamber view showed that the left atrium was compressed between the ascending and descending aortas. Color Doppler turbulence was also seen in the compressed area (). Left ventricular systolic function was normal, with ejection fraction of 65% and mild aortic regurgitation. A contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography scan in axial and coronal planes showed that left atrium and pulmonary veins were compressed by ascending and descending aortic aneurysms ( and ). Surgical management was advised, but her family preferred a conservative treatment.", "age": "[[89.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16174123': 1, '22840907': 1, '23640663': 1, '33391568': 2, '17250908': 1, '22755355': 1, '14729814': 1, '32369306': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7758589-1': 1}"}
