She was born at the gestational age of 41 weeks from a healthy mother after a normal pregnancy and vaginal delivery; her weight at the time of delivery was 2,800 g. She was hospitalized because of pneumonia of the right upper-lobe (RUL). A heart murmur was detected during a physical examination incidentally. Echocardiography revealed a large perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) with overriding aorta. She was, therefore, referred to our hospital for surgery. During preoperative evaluation, 3-dimensional reconstruction computed tomography (CT) of the thorax revealed stenosis of the trachea and tracheal bronchus (). A tracheal bronchus, with no upper lobe bronchi arising from the right main bronchus, had arisen from the right wall of the trachea 20 mm below the vocal cord. The stenotic lesion had extended from the origin of tracheal bronchus to the carina (length of stenosis was 22 mm), without involving the carina. The luminal diameter at the narrowest of the trachea was 2.4 mm. Although the patient presented with recurrent pneumonia, surgical intervention for tracheal stenosis was not scheduled because her respiratory condition was not compromised by the stenosis. Laboratory investigation revealed no significant findings.\\nAnesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium (5 mg/kg body weight), fentanyl (3 \u00b5g/kg body weight), and rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg body weight). A 3.5 mm uncuffed ETT was placed 5 mm above the tracheal bronchus, and the accuracy of tube positioning was confirmed by using a fiberoptic bronchoscope (BF-N20; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). General anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (end-tidal concentration of 1.0-2.0%) and intravenous infusion of fentanyl (3-5 \u00b5g/kg/h), and intermittent bolus doses of rocuronium (0.15 mg/kg body weight). Mechanical ventilation was performed in a pressure-controlled mode with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), 18-20 cmH2O; respiratory rate (RR), 20-25 breaths/min; end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), 30-40 mmHg; fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), 0.5-1.0, with oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging from 99-100%. The total correction of DORV was performed uneventfully under CPB. The CPB time was 81 minutes and the operation took 195 minutes.\\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). She was put on pressure-controlled ventilation under the following conditions: PIP, 20-23 cmH2O; RR, 20-25 breaths/min; positive end-expiratory pressure, 3-5 cmH2O; ETCO2, 32-55 mmHg; FiO2, 0.4-0.8; SpO2 98-99%. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful. On the first postoperative day (POD), spontaneous breathing trial was performed to discontinuation on mechanical ventilation and early postoperative extubation using T-piece. Significant hypercarbia (PaCO2 was 60-70 mmHg) and tachypnea (RR was 55-60 breaths/min) persisted and the tracheal tube could not be removed. Despite adjustments to increase minute ventilation, there was a gradual increase in end tidal carbon dioxide by 60-70 mmHg on POD #2-3. PIP in a pressure-controlled mode was readjusted from 20-23 cmH2O to 28-33 cmH2O. An arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.16; PaCO2, 89 mmHg; PaO2, 124 mmHg; and SpO2, 98% (FiO2 0.8). Chest auscultation revealed reduced breath sounds bilaterally. Plain chest radiography indicated RUL atelectasis (). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed almost complete occlusion of trachea below the tracheal bronchus. The patient was scheduled for surgical repair of congenital tracheal stenosis under slide tracheoplasty using CPB.\\nThe findings of the preoperative arterial blood gas analysis were as follows: pH 7.01; PaCO2, 115 mmHg; PaO2, 76 mmHg; and SpO2, 93% (FiO2 0.8). Other laboratory investigations revealed no significant findings. Immediately after the induction of general anesthesia, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly and ventilation was not effective. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe respiratory acidosis with CO2 retention of up to 130 mmHg. A median sternotomy was reopened promptly to expose the heart and blood vessels. After the establishment of CPB, CO2 levels were gradually reduced during the bypass period. The ETT was removed and fiberopic bronchoscopy was performed to confirm the extent and degree of stenosis. The trachea was then transected at the narrowest point which inner diameter was 1.0 mm (). Slide tracheoplasty was performed without any complications. Following this, the ETT was repositioned under direct visual guidance and mechanical ventilation was then resumed and CPB withdrawn. At the end of the surgery, the patient was hemodynamically stable.\\nThe patient was transferred to the ICU and placed under pressure controlled ventilation support. On POD #4, a portable chest X-ray showed an improvement in the RUL atelectasis. The endotracheal tube was extubated on POD #7 successfully. She was discharged from the ICU on POD #9. Three-dimensional reconstruction CT on POD #11 demonstrated an almost normal trachea and mild stenosis of the proximal main bronchus, but she did not suffer from any respiratory symptom.", "age": "[[3.0, 'week']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17444320': 1, '16488711': 1, '6482487': 1, '1931092': 1, '16675228': 1, '19231527': 1, '16410137': 1, '12914888': 1, '17596659': 1, '8652335': 1, '16307995': 1, '31456467': 1, '9356130': 1, '12205572': 1, '1416139': 1, '9498980': 1, '22474559': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
