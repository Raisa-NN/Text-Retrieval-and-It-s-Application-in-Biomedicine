Her physical exam was remarkable only for diffuse tenderness to palpation of the abdomen and mild to moderate distention. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis showed high-grade partial vs complete distal small bowel obstruction with terminal ileum thickening (Figure ).\\nCEA and CA19-9 were within normal limits. Colonoscopy resulted in ileocecal valve thickening suspicious for carcinoma. Surgery was performed and the specimen pathology showed a high-grade mixed adenocarcinoma/neuroendocrine tumor with metastasis in 3/10 lymph nodes. Immunohistochemistry was focally positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin (Figure ).\\nPost-surgery, positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was performed and showed changes from the recent ileocolonic resection with reanastomosis. There was no definitive evidence of metastatic disease.", "age": "[[56.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'25632209': 1, '29551754': 1, '30101026': 1, '24213223': 1, '33857061': 1, '32982118': 1, '28641295': 1, '23607079': 2, '30937240': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3625879-1': 1}"}
