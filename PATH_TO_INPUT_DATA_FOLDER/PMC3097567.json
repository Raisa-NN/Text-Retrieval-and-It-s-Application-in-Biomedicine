He escaped the place of accident but started complaining of severe burning in the eyes and throat as well as progressive shortness of breath. He was brought to the emergency by his colleagues and the history was obtained from them. On arrival in the ER, he was breathless. His eyes were congested and he was finding it difficult to talk. On examination, he had tachycardia (pulse rate 110/min) and tachypnea (respiratory rate 24/min) but the blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg. The examination of the oral cavity revealed copious pink frothy secretions. Chest examination revealed bilateral polyphonic wheeze. He was drowsy but was able to respond to commands and the oxygen saturation was 85% at room air.\\nDecontamination was done by removing all his clothes and irrigating the eyes with normal saline using nasal prongs. Both methylprednisolone (125 mg intravenously) and nebulized salbutamol were administered, the latter being difficult to perform due to copious secretions in the oral cavity. The patient was shifted to medical intensive care unit for further management. At this point intubation was contemplated as vigorous suction failed to get rid of the secretions. It was decided by the treating team to first administer 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate injection to reduce the secretion and try intubation if this failed.\\nWithin minutes the secretions reduced significantly. The patient was nebulized using beta 2 agonists again. He improved significantly and oxygen saturation of 95% was achieved on a FiO2 of 0.3 delivered by ventimask. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics and steroids were continued along with beta 2 agonists for another 48 hours. No further dose of glycopyrrolate was needed. Indirect laryngoscopy was performed to evaluate hoarseness of voice and it revealed an edematous vocal cord.\\nTopical cycloplegics were used to reduce eye discomfort. Within next 48 hours the patient improved significantly. The chest X-ray and the high resolution CT scan of chest did not reveal any significant alveolar damage. A pulmonary function test revealed mild obstruction. The patient was discharged after a 72 hour stay in the intensive care unit.", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18564794': 1, '6660462': 1, '6485732': 1, '8713325': 1, '7356435': 1, '7277552': 1, '29354023': 1, '21633586': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
