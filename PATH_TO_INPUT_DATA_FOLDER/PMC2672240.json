She was awake and alert, diaphoretic and vomited three times. The physical exam was normal. An ECG showed ST elevation in leads I, aVL, and V1\u2013V3, with a rate of 98 beats per minute and a QTc interval of 437 ms ().\\nInitial cardiac markers were elevated with a troponin I of 5.1 ng/ml (normal, 0.0\u20130.3 ng/ml), a total CK of 173 U/L (normal, 25\u2013145 U/L), and a CK-MB level of 24.7 ng/ml (normal, 0.0\u20135.0 ng/ml).\\nEmergent catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries, with a right-dominant system, and severe hypokinesis of the LV anteroapical wall, and mid to distal septum with apical ballooning. Echocardiograms performed at day 1 () and 4 showed a severely hypokinetic LV anteroapical wall and mid-to distal septum.", "age": "[[42.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12586269': 1, '16580961': 1, '17483198': 1, '33173648': 2, '7863998': 1, '30533145': 1, '12790360': 1, '16002949': 1, '11868050': 1, '17544159': 1, '15604352': 1, '12356599': 1, '16720686': 1, '22040382': 2, '12070106': 1, '16770984': 1, '28348711': 1, '16770985': 1, '5559442': 1, '15276100': 1, '17527002': 1, '15502392': 1, '8489663': 1, '10823529': 1, '11451258': 1, '34589169': 1, '11017994': 1, '16538434': 1, '15703419': 1, '31620447': 2, '15235057': 1, '16583180': 1, '16864923': 1, '16466125': 1, '27793870': 1, '15635210': 1, '24527248': 2, '14557691': 1, '17467826': 1, '17237229': 1, '7399504': 1, '1841907': 1, '15583228': 1, '1401872': 1, '23888192': 1, '12395363': 1, '27446769': 2, '9348044': 1, '14695470': 1, '11059622': 1, '11076819': 1, '12860233': 1, '12808278': 1, '9415014': 1, '12628716': 1, '19561716': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2672240-1': 2, '2672240-2': 2, '2672240-3': 2, '3914169-1': 1, '3914169-2': 1, '4954750-1': 1, '4954750-2': 1, '4954750-3': 1, '4954750-4': 1, '4954750-5': 1, '3216903-1': 1, '6759782-1': 1, '7647843-1': 1}"}
