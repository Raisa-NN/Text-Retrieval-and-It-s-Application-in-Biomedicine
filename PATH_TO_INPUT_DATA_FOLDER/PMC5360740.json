He was hypoxic, tachypneic, and tachycardic, but normotensive, with a GCS of 6/15. Glycemia was 600 mg/dl (33.3 mmol/l). Initial treatment included fluid resuscitation, intubation, and ventilation. Temperature measurement and point-of-care blood gas analysis were not available in the department at that time. Urinary ketones were negative. A presumed diagnosis of HHS was made, and insulin infusion was started as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics. No beds were available in the intensive care unit, so he was managed for several days in the ED. There was no significant past medical or drug history.\\nInitial laboratory results included a mildly raised white cell count, with normal electrolytes. He was HIV-negative. There was no bacterial growth in blood cultures, CSF, or urine. Chest X-ray and CT brain with contrast were both normal.\\nOn day 3, a 30-cm adult female ascaris worm was aspirated from his nasogastric tube (Fig. ), and abdominal ultrasound revealed a heavy worm load (Fig. , Additional file 1: Video 1 and Additional file 2: Video 2): several intra-luminal echogenic tubular structures exhibiting slow curling movements were seen in the small bowel. He was treated with albendazole and made a full recovery. No other precipitant for his HHS was identified, and he was discharged with a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, on metformin and glibenclamide.", "age": "[[26.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20934531': 1, '25320546': 1, '25342831': 1, '28245883': 1, '11013758': 1, '28324468': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
