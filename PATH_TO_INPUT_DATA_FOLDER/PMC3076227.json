Within 24 hours he developed an area of painful erythema, with blistering and increased local heat on both sides of his epigastric port incision. An area akin to superficial dermal partial thickness burn was in contact with the adhesive lateral aspects of the dressing, where it was fixed to skin [Figure ].\\nIt was observed that the central rectangular absorbent-pad part of the dressing had caused a well-demarcated indentation on the skin, although no pressure dressings had been applied [Figure ]. Retrieval of his gallbladder (using a Bag for Endoscopic Retrieval of Tissue) had been via his umbilical port, which was not affected by the described erythema and blistering. All skin incisions had been made with the scalpel, and there was no use of diathermy on the skin. None of the three other port sites were affected [Figure ]. The only plausible explanation was the method of application of the patient's dressing. Retrospective assessment of events leading up to onset of pain corroborated incorrect application by stretching of the dressing prior to its application to skin surface.", "age": "[[78.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'6545762': 1, '7630663': 1, '2715429': 1, '12192847': 1, '21443772': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
