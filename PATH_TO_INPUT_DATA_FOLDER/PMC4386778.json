The tumor showed slow growth over 14 months. The tumor had been previously resected at another institution under local anesthesia. The histologic report disclosed an aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma with margins not free of tumor (\u2013). Physical examination at our institution showed a bland scar on the middle dorsal phalanx with full function of the hand. X-ray imaging of the hand, magnetic resonance imaging, and a computed tomographic scan of the chest and abdomen were not suspicious for tumor spread. The patient refused finger amputation. An excision of the scar with adequate safety margins was done once again. There were no tumor cells detected in the histological specimen. The defect was covered with a full-thickness skin graft (). The sentinel lymph node was free of tumor. Postoperative wound healing was very good, and function of the right hand was not impaired. Staging procedures, including colonoscopy, bronchoscopy, gastroscopy, and ultrasound of the thyroid gland revealed no further tumor localization. No recurrence was detected at follow-up after 18 months.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18819728': 1, '22745098': 1, '18214401': 1, '31976065': 1, '19874325': 1, '3301927': 1, '9180731': 1, '34532052': 2, '27428196': 2, '12073193': 1, '11285414': 1, '26576210': 1, '16462393': 1, '33459374': 1, '16687341': 1, '10843279': 1, '22654416': 1, '23026931': 1, '25848311': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4386778-1': 2, '8436734-1': 1, '4956790-1': 1}"}
