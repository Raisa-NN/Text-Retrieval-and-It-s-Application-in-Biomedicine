MRI evaluation (Figure ) revealed a small infarct in the right periaqueductal white matter along the anatomic course of the right MLF. Moderate periventricular white matter changes were also visualized and likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic changes. Craniocervical MR angiography evaluation demonstrated moderate stenosis in the bilateral carotid bulbs, greater on the left than right. No significant stenosis in the circle of willis was noted.", "age": "[[72.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23322826': 1, '15824351': 1, '28869134': 1, '28541157': 1, '22189277': 1, '845644': 1, '34660029': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8500245-1': 2}"}
