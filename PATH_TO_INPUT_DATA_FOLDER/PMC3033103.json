Past medical history was unremarkable and baseline US liver study was normal, ALT were normal, HBsAg and anti-HBe positive, and HBV-DNA persistently below 2,000 IU/mL. He was categorized as inactive carrier and started on LAM before chemotherapy (6R-MINE: rituximab, mesna, ifosfamide, mitroxantrone, etoposide), taken until March 2007. During LAM therapy hematological remission was obtained, ALT were normal, while bilirubin and HBV-DNA remained slightly elevated. In July 2007, the patient continued the LAM treatment, and was admitted to the Liver Unit due to the development of jaundice. Lymphoma relapse was ruled out, but signs of viral and biochemical breakthroughs were present. summarizes the disease course. Hepatic failure, mild portal encephalopathy, and ascites developed. LAM resistance (L80V, L180M, M204I) was demonstrated by genotypic analysis (INNO-LiPA DR2), and ADV (10 mg/day) was added. Two weeks later viremia significantly decreased but bilirubin, INR and ALT increased. The addition of PDN (50 mg/day) determined a slight ALT decrease, however bilirubin and INR progressively worsened and the patient died because of irreversible liver failure.
