Headache was mainly in the occipital region radiating to the retroauricular region and the back of the neck. It was initially associated with vomiting.

Her routine urine examination, liver, and renal function tests were normal. Anti-nuclear antibody and anti-phospholipid antibodies were negative. Serum homocystine and C-reactive protein values were normal. Coagulation profile including prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time was normal. Her blood culture and sensitivity were negative. Pure tone audiometry showed moderate sensorineural deafness of right ear. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of brain with Magnetic Resonance Venogram was done and showed a thrombus in the right internal jugular vein and sigmoid sinus [Figures and ]. The thrombus was extending to right transverse sinus and confluence of sinuses []. The patient was treated with heparin in the hospital for a total of 4 week and subsequently switched over to oral anticoagulants. She had an uneventful twin delivery.
