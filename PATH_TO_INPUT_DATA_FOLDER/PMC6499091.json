Her medical history included a diagnosis of right-sided invasive lobular breast carcinoma (cT3N+, oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive, ERBB2 negative) 9 years earlier. She had undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a right radical mastectomy followed by local radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy and 5 years of endocrine therapy with tamoxifen.\\nIn the past 2 years, stage IV breast cancer with multifocal metastatic bone disease had been documented. Letrozole therapy was given initially, with partial response, but during the previous year there had been continuing on-going symptomatic bone involvement. The patient had declined further medical treatment and initiated alternative therapies, namely ozonotherapy. On physical examination, multiple skin-coloured to brown papules were seen on the neck, trunk, arms and thighs (). A punch biopsy was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of cutaneous infiltration by neoplastic cells, compatible with metastatic lobular carcinoma of the breast ().", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20228540': 1, '12630642': 1, '23557182': 1, '8335743': 1, '7622642': 1, '17515511': 1, '15186430': 1, '18312322': 1, '25178874': 1, '31139586': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
