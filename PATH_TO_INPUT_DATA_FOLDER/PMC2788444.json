Systemic examination revealed no abnormality, except for the presence of tenderness with guarding at McBurney\u2019s point. Digital rectal examination was normal. Laboratory investigations suggested mild leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11000/mm3 and 82% polymorphs on differential count. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen suggested minimal free fluid in right iliac fossa with normal solid viscera and the appendix was not visualized.\\nA provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis was considered and the patient was taken for surgical intervention. Surgical exploration was performed through Lanz incision, which revealed the presence of approximately 10 ml of serosanguinous fluid in the right iliac fossa with an appendix with normal appearence. Further exploration revealed the presence of gangrenous appendix epiploica on the surface of the cecum. The infracted appendage was excised with seromuscular inversion of the cecal wall and appendectomy. Histopathology revealed a normal appendix with congested, hemorrhagic and partly necrotic adipose tissue suggestive of appendicitis epiploicae. The postoperative period remained uneventful, and the child was discharged after 48 h.", "age": "[[8.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16380797': 1, '23255877': 1, '4038060': 1, '9921450': 1, '25587527': 2, '10987404': 1, '33562670': 2, '12226761': 1, '20011477': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4291452-1': 1, '7931071-1': 1, '7931071-2': 1}"}
