The lesion grew progressively and indolently, being accompanied by three episodes of local infection requiring drainage, a large quantity of purulent secretion having been removed.\\nThe lesion was excised en bloc\u2014the skin ellipse being strongly adhered to the adjacent skin because of previous infectious processes\u2014and sent for pathological examination. Macroscopic examination revealed a strip of skin measuring 4.5 \u00d7 3.0 cm, the epidermis being flattened. Dissection revealed a 3.0 cm cystic lesion with a brownish viscous liquid and shiny, irregular internal walls. Histology revealed that the lesion was located in the subcutaneous tissue and had fibrous tissue walls (). The lesion was found to be lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium, typical of the bronchial mucosa, with lymphoid tissue arranged in follicles (). Other findings included smooth muscle tissue (), as well as cartilage and seromucous glands typical of the respiratory mucosa (). Moderate mixed inflammatory infiltrate was found in the subepithelial connective tissue, the epithelium being permeated by lymphocytes and neutrophils, which were consistent with previous episodes of infection/inflammation.", "age": "[[4.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'6480944': 1, '11807461': 1, '20148842': 1, '21866472': 1, '16180006': 1, '9720691': 1, '831699': 1, '17141090': 1, '31528572': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
