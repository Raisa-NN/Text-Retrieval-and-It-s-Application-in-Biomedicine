She underwent inpatient EGD and received topical pharyngeal benzocaine spray along with moderate sedation. EGD was unremarkable, but during recovery, the patient became dyspneic, cyanotic, and her oxygen saturation (SaO2) dropped to 85% on room air. On chest examination, she had no wheezing, rhonchi, or crackles. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.50, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 21 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen 409 mmHg, and SaO2 99%. Blood work showed a methemoglobin level of 27.8%. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was given supplemental oxygen through facemask and IV ascorbic acid, which resolved her cyanosis and hypoxemia. Repeat methemoglobin level was 8.3% with normal oxygen saturation on room air. Upon stabilization, she was discharged home 48 hours after her initial presentation.", "age": "[[22.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'10533013': 1, '22915889': 1, '3813168': 1, '25663608': 1, '19224791': 1, '11498069': 1, '32494515': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
