Eleven years ago, he was diagnosed ESRD of unknown origin, and received a living related kidney transplantation from his father 1 year later. He underwent immunosuppressive agents based on cyclosporine, mycophenolate and corticosteroids. After KT, the patient was performed graft biopsy twice. The 1st biopsy result at 3 months after KT was consistent with acute interstitial nephritis and IgA nephropathy, and 2nd biopsy at 6 years after KT was acute cellular rejection IIb. The graft function had progressively declined to chronic kidney disease stage 4 at the latest visit of the outpatient clinic. At admission, he showed mild fever with body temperature 37.8 \u00b0C, and complained mild tenderness on graft kidney. Laboratory data showed white blood cell (WBC) 7400 /mm3, hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL, and platelet 258,000 /mm3, blood urea nitrogen 87 mg/dL, creatinine 11.2 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 5.0 mEq/L, and chloride 105 mEq/L. The urinalysis showed protein (++++), occult blood (+++), red blood cell (RBC) >100 /high power field (HPF), and WBC >100 /HPF. There were not decoy cells in urine cytology, and negative BK virus DNA by urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Abdominal sonography demonstrated a 7.9 cm-sized intra-pelvic hyperechoic mass causing obstructive pelvo-calyceal dilation of graft kidney (Fig. ). Abdominal magnetic resonance image showed a huge polypoid mass of graft kidney with pelvo-calyceal dilation, and there were a 3.3 cm-sized nodule in aortocaval chain and a 2.5 cm-sized nodule in right external iliac chain (Fig. ). There was no invasion to graft ureter orifice and bladder in cystoscopy (Fig. ). Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) showed a high uptake mass (standardized uptake value (SUV) max: 14.9) in graft kidney, and reactive lymph nodes with high uptake in right external iliac chain (SUV max: 9.6) and in aortocaval chain (SUV max: 10.1), and then it proved stage IV TCC (cT3N2M0, Fig. ). Sonography-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of the mass in the pelvis of graft kidney demonstrated a low grade urothelial carcinoma (Fig. ). Consecutively, radical nephroureterectomy of renal allograft was performed. The post-operative histopathology report confirmed as a low grade urothelial carcinoma of graft pelvis and ureter lumen, which invaded to perirenal fat and renal parenchyma with lymphovascular presence (T3Nx). The patient started with postoperative adjuvant concurrent chemo-radiation therapy and he returned to maintenance hemodialysis. Immunosuppressive agents were discontinued, and no tumor recurrence has been observed during the 24 months after the operation.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34127009': 2, '18184173': 1, '30636892': 1, '15168390': 1, '24798310': 1, '24596334': 1, '24507046': 1, '26709521': 1, '16797304': 1, '21373847': 1, '23781380': 2, '33093437': 1, '19845597': 1, '17942951': 1, '28934936': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3677624-1': 1, '3677624-2': 1, '8204527-1': 1}"}
