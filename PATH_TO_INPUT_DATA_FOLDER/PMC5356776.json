Her fasting blood glucose concentration was 8.7 mmol/L and HbA1c was 8.1%. Her visual acuity was 24/60 in the left eye and 48/60 in the contralateral eye; intraocular pressure was 18 mmHg and 19 mmHg, respectively. Fundus photography of the left eye revealed sporadic retinal microaneurysms and a sub-macular round dark reflection involving the fovea, without drusen. Additionally, macular leakage, multiple hyperfluorescent dots, choroidal neovasculation (CNV) and normal background fluorescence originating from RPE except for leakage were observed in the late stage by fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography, respectively. Moreover, a macular optic coherence tomography scan revealed subfoveal fluid together with detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). According to Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study standards, these data confirmed the presence of CNV in non-proliferative DR []. The CNV was not secondary to AMD; hence, it was speculated that CNV formation resulted from the diabetes mellitus. Examinations of the contralateral eye also suggested the presence of non-proliferative DR (Figure ).", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26951773': 1, '24349522': 1, '19429584': 1, '24970257': 1, '22915034': 1, '14559961': 1, '2582331': 1, '25670489': 1, '2062513': 1, '21814413': 1, '24691477': 1, '29348855': 1, '33846958': 1, '24732758': 1, '26889183': 1, '15452081': 1, '30588286': 1, '28008140': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
