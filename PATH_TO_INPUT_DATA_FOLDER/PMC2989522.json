She developed difficulty in gripping the footwear in both feet for the last three months. Clinical examination revealed power of grade 3/5 at the ankle joints. Sensory examination revealed 50% hypoesthesia below L4 dermatomes including perianal region for all modalities of sensation. Ankle jerks were absent bilaterally. Digital rectal examination revealed decreased anal sphincter tone. Upper limbs were normal. Other general and systemic examination was normal. MRI revealed a well-defined intramedullary lesion in the conus-epiconus region, which was expanding the cord. The lesion was hypointense on T1 WI and hyperintense on T2 WI. The patient underwent D12-L2 laminectomy. The conus region was markedly expanded; and through a midline myelotomy, near-total excision of the tumor including the capsule was performed. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of epidermoid cyst. She improved; and at four months followup, the ankle power was grade 4/5, minimal patchy sensory hypoesthesia and no urinary incontinence.", "age": "[[28.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'7309219': 1, '22567058': 1, '34295103': 1, '11714565': 1, '864501': 1, '2689904': 1, '10751819': 1, '5015073': 1, '1757803': 1, '26167216': 2, '17450353': 1, '15367801': 1, '33183334': 1, '12690335': 1, '14569267': 1, '32123605': 2, '10871034': 1, '11715543': 1, '14633311': 1, '4062352': 1, '8078615': 1, '1738035': 1, '2017296': 1, '14469387': 1, '21139798': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2989522-1': 2, '7049888-1': 1, '7049888-2': 1, '7049888-3': 1, '4489056-1': 1}"}
