In July 2008, the patient underwent a TUR-P for prostatic hyperplasia using 3 days of cefotiam (CTM) i.v. 0.5g \u00d72/day and was discharged from the hospital on Day 10 after surgery without fever. On about Day 40 after surgery, a fever of 38\u201339\u00b0C was observed, so the patient was suspected of having a urinary-tract infection and was admitted to the hospital.\\nBody height: 166.3 cm; Body weight: 59.5 kg; Body temperature: 37.8\u00b0C; Pulse rate: stable at 84/min; Blood pressure: 116/76 mmHg. Respiratory sound: resonant; Cardiac sound: clear/no noise; Abdomen: flat/soft; Neurological findings: nothing in particular.

A tendency for pyretolysis was observed, but because recovery from the urinary-tract infection was slow, echocardiography was performed for the purpose of eliminating endocarditis. In the echocardiogram findings, vegetation was observed, so Ampicillin (ABPC) 2 g \u00d7 4/day and Gentamicin (GM) 60 mg \u00d7 2/day were administered for four weeks. Pyretolysis and decreased CRP were observed, but the CRP did not become negative. Even after the 4-week administration of antibiotics, the vegetation persisted in the echocardiogram and a possibility of valve failure was suspected, so a valve replacement was performed. Furthermore, the head and chest to pelvic CT did not show any obvious abscess formation.", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'8316194': 1, '4860941': 1, '3925771': 1, '8154507': 1, '32055442': 1, '12543919': 1, '7223725': 1, '145198': 1, '20882162': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
