The first pregnancy went on well. There are no similar cases in the family. She did not show signs suggestive of systemic disease including systemic lupus erythematosus. The examination showed bilateral giant breasts with collateral venous circulation and trophic changes marked by the necrosis of the distal third of the mammary skin involving the nipple-areolar complex (). The histology of the biopsied ulcerative mammary gland was in favour of a subchronic inflammatory tissue without abscess. The biological search for autoantibodies like ANA, anti-ENA, and anti-dsDNA could not be done because it is not available.\\nThrough this consultation between obstetricians and surgeons, a normal delivery was conducted after foetal lung maturation. Twenty-one days postpartum, a reductive mammary surgery was performed with nipple plasty (Figures \u2013).\\nAfter a short period of lymphangitis (), postoperative follow-up was normal. Cosmetic and psychological result was satisfactory after 18 months (); the patient does not want to get pregnant again, but we are following her up regularly to appreciate long-term evolution.", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28458479': 1, '27012797': 1, '23354767': 1, '28904695': 1, '29776839': 1, '16980844': 1, '29938441': 1, '33344327': 2, '25236975': 1, '6476236': 1, '18054304': 1, '29592998': 1, '30032172': 1, '28869443': 1, '24852910': 1, '31236302': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7703335-1': 1}"}
