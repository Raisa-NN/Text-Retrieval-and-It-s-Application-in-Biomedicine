Physical examination revealed petechiae on lower extremity, mild splenomegaly, and axillary adenopathy. Ultrasound of the abdomen confirmed enlarged spleen measuring 13.3 cm. Initial laboratory workup was concerning for leukemia (Table ). Complete blood count (CBC) showed significant leukocytosis with white blood count of 150,100/\u03bcL, normocytic anemia with hemoglobin of 6.7 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 37,000/\u03bcL. The differential was notable for 84.6% blasts and absence of basophilia. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was markedly elevated at 785 IU/L.\\nBone marrow biopsy (BMB) showed diffuse infiltration by numerous blast cells, which effaced the normal marrow architecture (Fig. A). A large number of blast cells were also evident on the aspirate (Fig. B). Cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed the loss of chromosome 7 and the presence of Philadelphia chromosome: 45,XY,-7, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[19]/46,XY[1]. Blasts had minimally differentiated phenotype. Morphologically these cells were atypical with immature expression of CD34 and co-expression of CD13 and HLA-DR favoring an early myeloid differentiation rather than lymphoid origin. Flow cytometry on the marrow aspirate showed an abnormal population of cells expressing dim CD45, moderate CD19, dim CD13, bright CD34, HLA-DR, with a subset expressing dim CD117, dim MPO, and dim TdT is identified, comprising 72% of total events. An atypical subset of CD14 + CD64 + monocytes expresses dim CD2. These blasts were negative for surface kappa and surface lambda light chain immunoglobulins, as well as CD10, CD11b, CD14, CD16, CD64, CD56. Molecular studies showed BCR/ABL p190 mRNA PCR of 33.8% on international scale and negative p210. NPM1, FLT3, KIT, and CEPBA mutations were not detected.\\nOn admission, patient was started on hydroxyurea for cytoreduction along with routine tumor lysis prophylaxis with hydration and allopurinol. Dasatinib was started after 2 days once initial reports became available showing positive Philadelphia chromosome. Patient was then started on hyper-CVAD a few days later after extensive discussions about therapy choice. Five days after admission, patient developed headache, blurry vision, and floaters bilaterally. A computerized tomography (CT) of head was performed, and it did not show any acute intracranial bleed, mass, or midline shift. Blood pressure was normotensive. Ophthalmology was consulted, and they noted the following on fundus examination: Right eye has preretinal hemorrhage near fovea and left eye with intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhage. Their final impression was preretinal hemorrhages on both eyes and intraretinal hemorrhages on left eye secondary to thrombocytopenia. He underwent lumbar puncture (LP), and eight blasts were found in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on smear consistent with CNS involvement with leukemia.\\nPatient was placed on hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone) with dasatinib 100 mg daily. Biweekly intrathecal chemotherapy including intrathecal cytarabine (AraC) was initiated with subsequent LP showing clearance of blast cells in CSF. His blurry vision also resolved. Patient completed the 2-course hyper-CVAD regimen with good response. Dasatinib was continued throughout his treatment course, and no significant adverse effect was noted. Kinase domain mutation was not checked. BMB performed 3 months after diagnosis showed mildly hypocellular bone marrow without morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence of AML. Patient achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) at this point. Due to the high risk of relapse in Ph+ AML, patient subsequently received allo-HSCT. He had 10/10 HLA-matched haploidentical allo-HSCT from his brother (a total of 4.31 \u00d7 10e6 CD34+ cells were transfused) with conditioning regimen consists of cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg and total body irradiation (TBI) 1200 centigray (cGy). His course was complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but overall patient had been doing well for more than 18 months. Patient continued on dasatinib with plan to stop after 2 years from the date of allo-HSCT. Dose reduction and interruption were performed to improve tolerance due to gastrointestinal-related side effects. His BMB showed 100% donor chimerism and negative cytogenetics. FISH study for t(9;22) was negative, and monthly BCR/ABL p190 mRNA PCR level remained negative. By all tests, patient is in complete remission and minimal residual disease (MRD) negative.", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24994916': 1, '26367219': 1, '8952155': 1, '25110819': 1, '17369142': 1, '23521501': 1, '17608710': 1, '2232886': 1, '27069254': 1, '15136244': 1, '27094614': 1, '21228332': 1, '2094324': 1, '16916543': 1, '15120934': 1, '25300567': 1, '8251902': 1, '19454497': 1, '21692072': 1, '22691121': 1, '28396764': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
