Patient was clinically evaluated and underwent MRI of lumbar spine. MRI of lumbar spine [] reported T1-weighted and T2-weighted hypointense lesions of lumbar vertebrae along with degenerative changes. Based on MRI findings, further evaluation was suggested to rule out a marrow infiltrative disorder. Patient was referred for a whole body FDG-PET/CT to rule out multiple myeloma.\\nWhole body FDG-PET/CT [] from head to mid-thigh showed abnormal increased FDG uptake in interspinous ligament between L3-L4 vertebrae and the L3-L4 spinous processes (standard uptake value, max 6.2). FDG uptake is appreciated in the apposing surfaces of the spinous processes on transaxial images that show enlargement, flattening, and sclerosis []. Degenerative changes of spine were noted apart from the mild irregularity of the spinous process of L3 with minimal enhancement of the interspinous ligament at L3-L4 level raising the possibility of Baastrup's syndrome. There were no other abnormal sites of FDG uptake in spine, other bones, lymph nodes, and organs.", "age": "[[66.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18087748': 1, '34354104': 1, '18379391': 1, '25001025': 1, '14684538': 1, '21613439': 1, '27385901': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
