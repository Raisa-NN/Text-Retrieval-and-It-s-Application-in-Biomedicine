Intraoral examination revealed dental caries involving all primary molars and primary upper central and lateral incisors (a,b). Interestingly there was an unusual clinical finding with mandibular right lateral incisor and canine seen as an enlarged bifid crown, i.e., 83 and 82 with deep labio-lingual groove (a\u2013c). A comprehensive intraoral radiograph was advised for most carious teeth, and also a radiograph was taken for the bifid crown, which revealed complete tooth fusion with fused pulp chambers and root canals (d).\\nDue to patient\u2019s negative behavior, clinical findings of multiple dental issues, full mouth rehabilitation under general anesthesia was considered. Extraction of hopeless primary teeth was performed, as was pulpotomy with stainless steel crowns for deep caries lesions. Tooth colored fillings for initial carious lesions was carried out (e\u2013g). A fissure sealant was applied between the deep labio-lingual grooves of fused teeth as a preventive measure (h). The patient was followed for 2-week, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year post-treatment for evaluation, oral hygiene and topical fluoride application.", "age": "[[4.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11068663': 1, '3864806': 1, '3475662': 1, '5272471': 1, '6711604': 1, '12028316': 1, '26550101': 1, '29402820': 1, '3472185': 1, '3476301': 1, '3251992': 1, '11693013': 1, '26817002': 1, '15938344': 1, '10815574': 1, '25306150': 1, '33669966': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
