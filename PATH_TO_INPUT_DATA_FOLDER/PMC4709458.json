Three weeks prior, she sustained a flail chest, right hemothorax, splenic laceration, mesenteric injury, and lumbar and thoracic vertebral fractures in a motor-vehicle accident. She initially underwent a trauma laparotomy and right hemicolectomy. Significant hematemesis occurred 4 days after admission to the rehabilitation ward, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where a gastroscopy was performed. A large clot was observed in the fundus; however, there was no active bleeding. A Sengstaken\u2013Blakemore (SB) tube was inserted and the gastric balloon inflated under endoscopic vision, and 6 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma, 2 units of platelets and 10 units of cryoprecipitate were transfused. Hemodynamic stabilization was achieved, and serum hemoglobin rose from 61 to 89 g/dl . A repeat gastroscopy the following day demonstrated the fundal clot plus a large MWT at gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) (Fig. ). Adrenaline (1:10 000) was injected around the tear, and the SB tube was removed. The patient subsequently developed a pulmonary embolism, which was treated with an inferior vena caval filter. On Day 5 after transfer to the ICU, the patient was discharged to the regular ward. She was receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Hematemesis recurred on Day 8, and the patient was intubated because of hemodynamic instability. Gastroscopy was performed after massive transfusion resuscitation, and the large fundal clot and MWT were again noted. Hemostatic powder (EndoClot\u00ae) was applied over the probable location of the fundal ulcer as well as MWT though there was no active bleeding.\\nGastroscopy the following day showed a fundal gastric ulcer and the MWT, which was now larger and deeper (Fig. ). On Day 10, the patient underwent surgery. A midline laparotomy incision was performed, followed by extensive adhesiolysis. After the anterior wall of the stomach was exposed from the GEJ to pylorus, a longitudinal gastrotomy was created over the fundus. There was a deep MWT at GEJ extending along the greater curve of the stomach, which was bleeding actively. The MWT was oversewn with interrupted 3/0 PDS sutures and hemostasis achieved. A second, larger fundal ulcer, presumably from pressure necrosis of SB tube, was also noted. This ulcer occupied most of the fundus of stomach, which was excluded from the gastric cavity, by the closure of fundus with interrupted 3/0 PDS (Fig. ). Postoperatively, oral fluids were commenced on Day 12. On Day 15, a Gastrografin swallow study was normal, and oral intake was encouraged. The patient recovered without complications and returned to the rehabilitation facility.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'14454970': 1, '638449': 1, '2222017': 1, '6600377': 1, '23023268': 1, '22688850': 1, '26757734': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
