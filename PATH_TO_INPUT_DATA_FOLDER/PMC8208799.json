The patient responded to initial resuscitation and abdomen CT scan showed mild hemoperitoneum, significant fat stranding and mesenteric hematoma. Exploratory laparotomy revealed avulsed greater omentum from the transverse colon, extensive laceration of right colon mesentery and crushed pancreatic head. Extended right hemicolectomy without anastomosis, partial omentectomy and packing of pancreas head were done and the abdomen left temporarily closed with ABThera technique.\\nA second-look surgery was performed 48-h later and ICG fluoroscopy was applied which revealed a non-perfused 20 cm of distal ileum (\u2013). Resection of the ischemic segment was done, and the second bolus of ICG was given attesting the good perfusion of the anastomotic edges. This Ileocolic anastomosis was drained along with the pancreatic head while the abdomen was closed. Follow-up magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed no pancreatic ductal injury.", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19903075': 1, '26200636': 1, '25747629': 1, '26392333': 1, '10813128': 1, '29992520': 1, '17245179': 1, '31579783': 1, '29938401': 1, '30903276': 1, '26394736': 1, '21724249': 1, '26968863': 1, '29230591': 1, '30251153': 1, '34150193': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8208799-1': 2, '8208799-2': 2}"}
