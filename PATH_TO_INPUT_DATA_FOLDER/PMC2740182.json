Her medical history included coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis for 7 months, insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Her surgical history included thyroidectomy and left upper extremity graft in October 2005 which failed to maturate and patient did not follow up. Patient was admitted in March 2006 for symptoms of worsening of lower extremity swelling and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea when her laboratory results showed BUN-141 mg/dl and creatinine-8.1 mg/dl. Patient underwent fistulogram which showed multiple high-grade stenosis. She had internal jugular catheter placed at the time and was started on daily hemodialysis. When she was discharged 6 days later, her BUN was 33 mg/dl and creatinine was 5.4 mg/dl. She was advised to follow with the dialysis center three times weekly, however patient remained noncompliant with intermittent dialysis. Since the September 2006 hospitalization as described on the case she was dialyzed regularly on Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday. She also had right lower extremity angiogram with an attempted right superficial femoral arterectomy and angioplasty which failed because of severely calcified vessels and multiple wound debridements in the past 3-4 months. Drug therapy included aspirin 81 mg daily, pentoxifylline 400 mg 3 times daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, amlodipine 10 mg and minoxidil 2.5 mg daily, insulin 70/30 22 units every morning and 12 units every evening, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, albuterol and atrovent inhalers as needed, levothyroxine 150 mcg daily, PhosLo 2 caps 3 times daily, cinacalcet 30 mg daily, colace 100 mg twice daily, hydrocodone 500 mg as needed. Patient denied any exposure to tobacco, ethanol, and intravenous drug abuse. She had 2 children and lived with her son and daughter-in-law who are the primary caretakers. Family history included chronic kidney disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease and diabetes.\\nSix months prior to presentation, she was found to have significant hyperparathyroidism (serum intact parathormone of 1133 pg/ml [normal, 10-65]) and hypercalcemia of 11.1 mg/dl [normal, 8.5-10.5]. Meanwhile, she developed 7 \u00d7 4 cm ulcer on the posterior aspect of right calf after a burn which remained non-healing for more than 2 weeks. She complained of severe local pain and continued developing multiple ulcerations on both lower extremities. Wound care and pain management was attempted as outpatient. Admission followed due to worsening of ulcerations and poor pain control. On admission, physical examination revealed obese (Ht-154 cm, Wt-84 kgs, BMI-35) African American female in distress due to pain with marked abdominal adiposity, absent pedal pulses and extensive lesions on the hips, buttocks, and proximal thighs with surrounding erythema, induration and dark eschar ( & ). No other pertinent physical findings were present. Laboratory studies showed serum calcium of 8.6 mg/dl (normal, 8.5-10.5), serum phosphorous of 3.7 mg/dl (normal, 2.5-5.0), calcium-phosphorous product - 31.8, parathormone of 155 pg/ml (normal, 10-65), urea of 35 mg/dl (normal, 7-20) and creatinine of 4.3 mg/dl (normal, 0.8-1.3), alkaline phosphatase-145 IU (normal, 70-230 IU), and serum albumin-1.9 g/dl (normal, 3.5-5.5 g/dl).\\nX-ray of lower extremities revealed extensive arterial calcifications within the femoral, popliteal artery and smaller branches. Nuclear medicine scan of parathyroid showed adenoma of the right lobe. With significant multiple co morbidities of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease and end stage renal disease, we considered the possibilities of ischemic ulcers and superimposed infection. The patient underwent several investigations, including a lower extremity angiogram with an attempted right superficial femoral arterectomy and angioplasty which failed because of severely calcified vessels and multiple wound debridements in the past 3-4 months. Hypercoagulable state with cryoglobulinemia was also ruled out, with the results of protein C, protein S and antithrombin-3 being in the normal range.\\nA biopsy of the lower extremity ulcer demonstrated circumferential vascular mural calcification affecting small and medium sized blood vessels with degeneration of elastic fibers and absence of inflammation (). During her hospitalization, despite attempts to control deterioration (wound care, pain control, hemodialysis and parenteral antibiotics), leg wounds and general condition worsened over the next 3-4 weeks. She exhibited periodic disorientation. Upon multiple discussions with the family on different treatment options and overall poor prognosis, the patient\u2019s family opted for comfort care under Hospice. Patient expired two days later.", "age": "[[78.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16684274': 1, '12732749': 1, '11436366': 1, '16877187': 1, '7557937': 1, '17141359': 1, '8829111': 1, '19830094': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
