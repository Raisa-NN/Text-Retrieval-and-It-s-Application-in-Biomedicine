There was nothing remarkable other than psoriatic arthritis in the medical history. Thirty days earlier, treatment with SSZ (2 g/day) was commenced in response to the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. At the time of admission, her blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg and her temperature was 37\u00b0C. Her blood pressure was normal during patient monitoring. Neurological examination revealed retrograde amnesia and mild right hemiparesis. The fundoscopic examination was normal. Serum biochemical and hematologic tests were within normal limits. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was also normal and CSF cultures were negative. An electroencephalogram showed mild slowing of background activity particularly at anterior frontotemporal areas bilaterally. Cranial computed tomography was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintensity in basal ganglia, thalami, pons and white matter, with sparing of the cerebral cortices and subcortical white matter. The affected region had isointensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (fig. ). The antiepileptic drug was given for recurrent generalized seizures. SSZ was stopped. All neurological symptoms and signs resolved 5 days after SSZ was discontinued. On the 30th day after presentation, a new MRI showed resolution of the edema (fig. ).", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18356474': 1, '29515421': 2, '18403560': 1, '23971457': 1, '30656003': 2, '19050416': 1, '17698535': 1, '16946577': 1, '26304730': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6332822-1': 1, '5836266-1': 1}"}
