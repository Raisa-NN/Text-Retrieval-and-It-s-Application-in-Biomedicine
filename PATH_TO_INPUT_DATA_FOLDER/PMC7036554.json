She initially underwent a total hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy and omentectomy, and completed adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin.\\nIn 2012, the disease relapsed in the rectosigmoid transition, presenting as intestinal sub-occlusion. Therefore, she was submitted to the endoscopic placement of a colic prosthesis (Fig. ) and palliative chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin was started, achieving a partial response. In 2015, there was new progression of the colonic disease, presenting again with intestinal sub-occlusion, and a new prosthesis was placed. At that time, the patient started referring to intermittent anorectal pain that radiated to the lower limbs, with breakthrough pain that scored 10/10 on the visual analogue scale. The pain had an important neuropathic component described by the patient as a feeling of an electric shock, burning or a biting sensation. She also referred to the seated position, certain movements, and intestinal elimination as factors of aggravation. Although medicated daily with hydromorphone 32 mg and pregabalin 25 mg, with fentanyl sublingual 200 \u03bcg as a rescue medication for breakthrough pain, she continued to have uncontrolled pain, which had an important impact on her daily life. She was then referred to the Pain Unit of the Hospital Prof. Dr. Fernando Fonseca. An initial improvement was achieved with an opioid rotation to transdermal fentanyl and a combination of corticosteroids, but after a couple of months a constant dose increase was needed and soon she was medicated with transdermal fentanyl 175 \u03bcg/h associated with pregabalin 400 mg/day, prednisolone 20 mg/day, and sublingual fentanyl 400 \u03bcg as rescue medication.\\nAt the end of 2017, there was a new increase in pain intensity associated with the appearance of a rectovaginal fistula. By this time, palliative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide was initiated with good tolerability but no effect on pain control, needing constant rescue medication. Since this patient was collaborative, had a good performance status, had good family support, and had undergone extremely frequent analgesia adjustments with little or no effect, it was suggested to her that she should undergo an invasive technique for pelvic and perineal pain management. Therefore, in January 2018, she was submitted to a ganglion impar neurolysis guided by fluoroscopy, with the administration of 5 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 3 mL of alcohol at 70%, which was done without problems (Fig. , ). One week after the procedure, the patient already reported 10-h periods without pain, tolerance of longer periods in a seated position, and improved sleep patterns, with a reduction in the need for rescue medication from 9\u201310 pills of sublingual fentanyl 400 \u03bcg per day to 1\u20132 pills. This improvement in pain control was maintained for about 3 months, with an important gain in the quality of life. After this period, there was new disease progression and an increase in the number of episodes of breakthrough pain per day. Since the patient had benefited before from the ganglion impar neurolysis, a second procedure was suggested to her, this time with a complementary blockade of the superior hypogastric plexus, which allowed pain control for about 2 months. During this time, the patient maintained palliative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide. She maintained a good quality of life and independence in the activities of her daily life till July 2018. At this point there was disease progression refractory to the systemic therapy and the patient died in early August.", "age": "[[75.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27458286': 1, '22997447': 1, '18675753': 1, '21615855': 1, '29276402': 1, '17355955': 1, '25337174': 1, '18837908': 1, '17876362': 1, '25675070': 1, '27208713': 1, '23250792': 1, '19692797': 1, '32110217': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
