She gave a history of snakebite 3 months earlier, for which she received multiple doses of antivenom as well as hemodialysis. She was unable to identify the snake as the incident occurred at night, resulting in poor visibility. Best-corrected visual acuities were hand movements in both eyes. Anterior segment examination revealed clear cornea, quiet anterior chamber, and clear lens in both eyes. On fundoscopy, both eyes showed vitreous hemorrhage precluding any view of the retina. The patient was advised B-scan ultrasonography of both eyes, which revealed an underlying TRD involving the macula [Fig. and ]. The patient was advised 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy in conjunction with belt buckling, endolaser, and silicone oil tamponade under general anesthesia in both eyes under steroid cover. She was asked to undergo the same in the left eye first. Intraoperatively, left eye showed proliferative retinopathy with extensive TRD involving the posterior pole []. At 6 weeks postoperatively, best-corrected visual acuity of the left eye was noted to be 20/200. Fundoscopy of the left eye showed settled TRD with an attached retina, peripheral laser marks, and silicone oil reflex []. The patient was advised surgery in the right eye during the follow-up period of the left eye, but patient declined the same.", "age": "[[13.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'615142': 1, '10983553': 1, '26240510': 2, '24454404': 1, '9567021': 1, '32911777': 1, '16172485': 1, '12698017': 1, '16139013': 1, '17923560': 1, '29133665': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4520869-1': 1, '4520869-2': 1}"}
