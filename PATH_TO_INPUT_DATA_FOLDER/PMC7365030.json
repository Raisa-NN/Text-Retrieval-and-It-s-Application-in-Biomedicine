The chest CT revealed a 32-mm solid pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe without lymph node enlargement (). The 3D-CT revealed that the right upper pulmonary vein (V1 + 2) ran posterior to the pulmonary artery and anterior to the bronchus intermedius (). On the other hand, anterior segmental vein (V3) had venous return anterior to the top of hilum. Based on this information, we performed right upper lobectomy with systemic lymph node dissection under VATS. Intraoperative findings showed that the V1 + 2 drained to the left atrium between the main pulmonary artery and the bronchus intermedius (), which was clearly detected by the preoperative 3D-CT. We exposed the pulmonary vessels at the hilum and V3 was found superiorly on the most ventral side of the hilum, whereas we could not identify V1 + 2, which is usually located anterior to the hilum. After the V3 and the ascending pulmonary artery were ligated, we recognized the V1 + 2 at the dorsal side of the main pulmonary artery. The anomalous V1 + 2 were isolated and ligated with a vascular stapler. Therefore, it was possible to complete VATS lobectomy without any complications. Pathological examination showed adenocarcinoma with no lymph node metastasis. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7.", "age": "[[62.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'14501365': 1, '30758813': 1, '15919274': 1, '22776372': 1, '29573182': 1, '25342848': 1, '14739316': 1, '32699588': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
