His past medical history included neurosyphilis for approximately 8 years. A physical examination revealed little upper abdominal quadrant tenderness. Biochemistry demonstrated elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase levels, and leukocytosis. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging showed a complete stop at the biliary bifurcation compatible with a Klatskin tumor associated to common bile duct stones (Figure \\n). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed dilated intrahepatic ducts and common bile duct above multiple polylobed filling defects. These findings were mainly suggestive of multiple impacted stones of his common bile duct, cholangiocarcinoma, or hemobilia. After an endoscopic sphincterotomy, a balloon sweep retrieved friable, polypoid soft tissue from his bile ducts (Figure \\n). Two biliary plastic stents were placed. Histology of the tissue demonstrated papillary adenomatous proliferation showing high-grade dysplasia; the patient was referred for surgical management. Laparoscopic exploration demonstrated a dilated common biliary duct. A transversal choledochotomy revealed a papillary polylobed mass (Figures \\n and\\n). Common bile duct resection was performed with macroscopically safe margins and biliary reconstruction was achieved by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.", "age": "[[51.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9676466': 1, '12168796': 1, '17026772': 2, '10849979': 1, '18226706': 1, '17600352': 1, '16341314': 1, '19649560': 1, '14770435': 1, '10022657': 1, '7698629': 1, '9932755': 1, '11682045': 1, '10817178': 1, '24885726': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'1618388-1': 1}"}
