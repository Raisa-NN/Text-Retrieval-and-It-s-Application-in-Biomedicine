The hematoma was edematous to the point of total skin necrosis. Citalopram was recently started on the patient. No history of trauma or aspirin use was available. The wound measured 30 \u00d7 15 cm2 and stretched from the patient's lateral aspect of the tibia to the almost posterior midline of the left calf. The laboratory results revealed normocytic anemia with abnormal coagulation tests. 750 cc of the hematoma was evacuated during surgery using cautery excision of the necrosed skin layers.", "age": "[[85.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12937232': 1, '17506225': 1, '3018111': 1, '26095120': 1, '16893410': 1, '34950549': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
