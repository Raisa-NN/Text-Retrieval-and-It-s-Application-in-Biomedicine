The patient had a history of anterior myocardial infarction with severe left ventricular dysfunction (EF 20%). Under general anesthesia, left ventricle was approached via trans-septal puncture. Using a 20-poles catheter (2-2-2 mm interelectrodes distance, Livewire\u2122, Abbott, MN, USA), a high-density map was built with the EnSite Precision\u2122 Mapping System (Abbott, MN, USA). During sinus rhythm, a large myocardial scar (<0.2 mV) on the anterior and septal LV wall was documented, but no late potentials were recorded. A clinical VT (CL [cycle length] 400 ms), hemodynamically tolerated, was induced. An activation map of the VT was attempted (Figure ) with the entire diastolic pathway depicted. Pulses of RF (50 W, 43\u00b0C) were delivered at the isthmus site with immediate termination of the arrhythmia. No ventricular arrhythmias were induced up to three extrastimuli. No complications were encountered. At 6 months of follow-up, patient did not experience VT recurrences.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34141004': 1, '25870335': 1, '30997051': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
