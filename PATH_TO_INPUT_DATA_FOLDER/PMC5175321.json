An examination found tenesmus, obstinate constipation, and dysuria. It revealed a dry perineal swelling, which was painless, and extended back to his anus, scrotum and penis. His testicles were mobile, and there were enlarged and fixed lymphadenopathies (Fig. ).\\nA pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan found a large mass on his perineum, fairly limited, driving his testicles forward, with regional lymphadenopathies without secondary lesion.\\nA pathological examination of the biopsy fragments taken under ultrasound showed a tumor proliferation composed of small-sized cell nuclei with an increase in the nucleocytoplasmic ratio, with a fairly monomorphic appearance and associated with mitotic figures. These cells were disposed around slots. Some cells had an eosinophilic cytoplasm appearance (Fig. ).\\nAt immune marking, NCAM and myogenin (Figs. and ) were strongly positive, while CKAE1/AE3 antibody, CD45, synaptophysin, and chromogranin were negative. Our patient was classified T2N1M0 and then considered as stage III.\\nOutcome was quickly marked by anal obstruction and colostomy. He died after 6 months of follow-up with only supportive care.", "age": "[[22.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21802959': 1, '12891513': 1, '17264331': 1, '24725692': 1, '7636557': 1, '24045440': 1, '8625211': 1, '11745872': 1, '17689957': 1, '27998313': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
