His visual acuity was 20/300 on his left side. There was swelling and erythema of his left optic disc. Goldmann perimetry showed enlargement of Mariotte's blind spot and a paracentral scotoma of his left eye. Laboratory tests revealed a CRP of 0.5 mg/dl, while the ESR, ACE, FTA, and ANCA were all within the normal range. The results of hematology tests, renal and liver function tests, urine analysis, chest radiography, and computed tomography were all within normal limits. MR images revealed no abnormalities in his brain. On fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, the area around his left optic nerve showed a high intensity (Figure ). Steroid pulse therapy was initiated. After seven days, his vision improved to 20/15 on the left. Subsequently, the dose of steroids was gradually reduced. No recurrence has been noted after 15 months.", "age": "[[27.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31775664': 2, '31886042': 2, '34104798': 1, '11545635': 1, '9427176': 1, '28652823': 2, '26130147': 1, '28078151': 2, '27928329': 1, '8299506': 1, '23569976': 1, '34712522': 2, '6505955': 1, '26753870': 1, '21143958': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3008697-1': 2, '3008697-2': 2, '6882196-1': 1, '5476656-1': 1, '5476656-2': 1, '5476656-3': 1, '5476656-4': 1, '5476656-5': 1, '5476656-6': 1, '5476656-7': 1, '5203866-1': 1, '8542256-1': 1, '6901378-1': 1}"}
