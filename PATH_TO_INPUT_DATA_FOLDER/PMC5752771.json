The patient reported no pain on neck movements or any other neurological symptoms. Medical management of hypothyroidism was optimal with oral thyroxine for 2 years. The cervical spine X-ray was normal, but MRI revealed C5\u2013C6 disc protrusion along with thecal sac compression and compromised bilateral lateral recesses. Similarly, in this patient, the topographic distribution of pain represented the distribution of SCP. A diagnostic USG SCP block resulted in complete relief of pain. Pain recurred after 1 month and a pulsed radio frequency (PRF) treatment of SCP for 8 min at 42\u00b0C was performed. At 6 months follow-up, the pain was stabilised with oral gabapentin 100 mg HS.
