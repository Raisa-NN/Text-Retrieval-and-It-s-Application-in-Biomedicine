Postoperative visual acuity was 20/50 (6/15) with an intraocular pressure of 14 mm Hg, and the surgeon noted a globule superiorly. Vision stabilized at the 20/40 (6/12) level till 18 months after surgery, when vision dropped to 20/80 (6/24) with corneal edema and to finger counting 1 month later. Since then, the patient suffered from recurrent episodes of epithelial defects (fig. ). An anterior segment OCT of the globule was similar to that of case 1 (fig. ). Also, the anterior segment OCT demonstrated direct contact of the globule with the corneal endothelium. Thirty months after surgery, the patient agreed to have the ointment removed with application of an amniotic membrane. The same technique was applied as in case 1, except that some ointment was left behind and was aspirated with a Simcoe irrigation aspiration system. Postoperative vision was finger counting at 2 m. Specular microscopy of the central cornea of the fellow eye revealed a low endothelial count (621 cells/mm2).", "age": "[[82.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'24950591': 1, '15028481': 1, '4354490': 1, '19847618': 1, '16565012': 1, '12663030': 1, '20337265': 1, '15808189': 1, '22231764': 1, '10609218': 1, '22001107': 1, '16564997': 1, '25302013': 1, '30687069': 1, '16565014': 1, '25317548': 1, '12781294': 1, '17137997': 1, '20670090': 1, '14220603': 1, '16355955': 1, '16765812': 1, '26955351': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
