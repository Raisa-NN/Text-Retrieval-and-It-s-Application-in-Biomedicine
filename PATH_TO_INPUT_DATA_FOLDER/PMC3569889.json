The girl was known with hypoplastic left heart syndrome after Norwood-procedure with placement of a Sanoconduit between the right ventricle and pulmonary arteries, followed by bidirectional cavopulmonary connection with closure of the Sanoshunt. To assess the nature and extent of the mediastinal fluid collection, CT imaging was performed. On CT, a large precardiac fluid collection with open connection to the right ventricle was found (). CT differential diagnosis was right ventricular patch aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. At surgery, pseudoaneurysm formation was confirmed at the site of previous anastomosis of the Sanoshunt to the right ventricle that had been closed by a patch. The pseudoaneurysm was removed. Currently, the patient is scheduled for completion of the Fontan circulation by connecting the inferior caval vein to the right pulmonary artery.", "age": "[[2.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12682792': 1, '16153560': 1, '18487238': 1, '16897779': 1, '1575144': 1, '18677608': 1, '18716119': 1, '8888241': 1, '14602304': 1, '11896223': 1, '19513718': 1, '15627194': 1, '8207777': 1, '20851940': 1, '19380544': 1, '11856688': 1, '22045045': 1, '15464458': 1, '10969678': 1, '12084585': 1, '15818290': 1, '16305896': 1, '23424699': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3569889-1': 2, '3569889-2': 2}"}
