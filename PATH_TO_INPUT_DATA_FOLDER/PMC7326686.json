She stated that the mass had existed at birth, but it had been growing for the last 10 years. The patient underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting six years ago due to increased idiopathic intracranial pressure and the shunt could be palpated manually under the skin at a distance of 2 centimeters from the FEP. Apart from this, the systemic examination was unremarkable and the patient had no additional disease. A thorax magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed nevoid formation at the dermis level, which has not invaded subcutaneous tissues. Then, the patient was scheduled for surgical excision. Patient\u2019s informed consent form was obtained for this report. Under general anesthesia, the tumor was excised up to the superficial fascia with a 5 millimeters safety margin. The defect area was repaired with a split-thickness skin graft taken from the anterior aspect of the left thigh. The pathology of the lesion was reported as a fibroepithelial polyp covered with stratified squamous epithelium, edematous fibrovascular stroma () and congested, proliferated and dilated vascular structures within the stroma (). No recurrence was seen in the third-month follow-up of the patient ().", "age": "[[21.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26142392': 1, '28743098': 1, '17988334': 1, '20464083': 1, '26577974': 1, '29487969': 1, '3582706': 1, '14991536': 1, '20948060': 1, '20033751': 1, '15963814': 1, '32617069': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
