He was initially referred to A&E by his rehabilitation centre after his indwelling catheter fell out and he went into retention. He was discharged from the A&E after a catheter change. The following day he returned to the A&E with retention and catheter dislodgement, again being discharged after a catheter change.\\nTwo days later, the patient was brought back to A&E by an ambulance with acute abdominal pain. His catheter had dislodged at the rehabilitation centre and a district nurse was called to resite the catheter. After resiting the catheter, the nurse reported that she heard a balloon burst and so did not attempt to site another. A catheter was inserted by the urology registrar which drained 800 mLs of clear urine. This instantly failed. An abdominal X-ray was requested by the urology registrar.", "age": "[[90.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1467856': 1, '16515963': 1, '17726350': 1, '10778475': 1, '23984173': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
