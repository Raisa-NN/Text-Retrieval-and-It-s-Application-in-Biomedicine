However, 3 months later he was admitted with fever with chills and rigors. Investigations revealed bilateral hydronephrosis for which B/L nephrostomy and antegrade stenting was carried out. Nephrostogram showed narrowing of the right ureteroileal anastomosis []. He responded well to the treatment with intravenous antibiotics. He further developed episodes of fever, malaise, and weight loss. Conduitoscopy revealed the presence of the lower end of left JJ stent only. The lower end of the right JJ stent was not to be seen. Ultrasound revealed the lower end of right JJ stent to be lying in an abscess cavity in the retroperitoneum outside the ileal conduit []. On exploration, the lower end of the stent was indeed in an abscess cavity, which had involved the ureteroileal anastomosis. Revision of the ileal conduit was thus carried out. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. On follow-up, his renal function has remained stable with no evidence of obstruction at the ureteroileal anastomosis.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19945660': 1, '33120009': 1, '1895452': 1, '4007790': 1, '12775093': 1, '6887376': 1, '12235330': 1, '34866694': 1, '15851050': 1, '7938676': 1, '28785193': 1, '30860076': 1, '2323163': 1, '2961892': 1, '32950051': 2, '7635768': 1, '1113390': 1, '7828135': 1, '15006055': 1, '8944505': 1, '11506509': 1, '11325084': 1, '34466220': 1, '6025928': 1, '6726935': 1, '2918584': 1, '7431509': 1, '24235801': 1, '8410885': 1, '21716883': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3114581-1': 2, '3114581-2': 2, '3114581-3': 2, '3114581-4': 2, '7502199-1': 1}"}
