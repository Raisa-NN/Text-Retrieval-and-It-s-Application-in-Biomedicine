These events usually happened in the morning, before breakfast, and resolved spontaneously after vomiting. Physical examination noted only mild tenderness on upper abdominal examination.\\nHaematological and biochemical profiling were performed, as well as plain abdominal radiographs (Fig. ) and abdominal ultrasound, all showing no relevant changes. The upper endoscopy revealed a mild esophagitis. An upper gastrointestinal series was later executed, revealing the presence of an organoaxial volvulus (Fig. ).\\nThe patient was submitted to exploratory laparoscopy, which confirmed the diagnosis and revealed a large and bulky stomach, with signs of diminished vascular supply. Therefore, the surgeons decided to perform a partial gastrectomy, from which the patient recovered uneventfully. Pathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis and showed ischaemia of the gastric mucosa. He was discharged on the sixth post-operative day and presented no complaints 2 years after the surgery.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18652696': 2, '31872178': 1, '19014426': 2, '27835806': 1, '26161290': 2, '17180266': 1, '34815878': 1, '23833761': 2, '10499699': 1, '20306915': 1, '20806439': 1, '30151116': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6105112-1': 2, '2588627-1': 1, '4496443-1': 1, '2500025-1': 1, '3699688-1': 1}"}
