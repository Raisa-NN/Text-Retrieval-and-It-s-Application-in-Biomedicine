Physical examination revealed cervical axis flattening, right trapezius and paravertebral muscle spasm, tingling in the area, and limitation of neck movement. Cervical magnetic resonance (MR) revealed enlargement of the right vertebral foramen at the C3\u2013C4 level, scalloping on the right side of the vertebral corpus, thinning on the right pedicle, and compression of the nerve root by the vascular structure on the right side (Figs. and ). Neither bone pathology nor intervertebral disc herniation was observed. The described findings were thought to be due to pathology present in the vertebral artery. Vertebral artery loop formation (VALF) was observed at the C4 vertebral level upon examination using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (Fig. ). Considering the age of the patient, computed tomography (CT) was not performed to prevent exposure to ionizing radiation. In addition, because the diagnosis was not in doubt, it was thought that CT would not provide any additional clinical contribution. The patient was referred to the neurosurgery clinic. Considering the surgical risks, it was decided to follow the patient with conservative methods, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were recommended for pain control if necessary.", "age": "[[19.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'24428889': 2, '25426228': 1, '19330226': 1, '28528478': 1, '21286489': 1, '5437280': 1, '11147852': 1, '8724095': 1, '32981528': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3900268-1': 1, '3900268-2': 1}"}
