She responded well to carbamazepine. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits. Routine hematology and serum chemistry revealed no abnormalities.\\nPreoperative computed tomography (CT) scan showed a well-circumscribed superficial hyperdense solid nodule in the left frontoparietal lobe with remodeling of the inner table of the skull (). The MRI showed a lesion that was isointense in T1 with perilesional contrast enhancement and hypointense in T2 (). No mass effect or ventricle involvement was seen.\\nThe patient underwent surgery and the mass was totally removed.\\nThe girl received no postoperative radiation therapy or chemotherapy. She is currently being followed up and does not show any clinical evidence of relapse two years after surgery.", "age": "[[10.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27226865': 1, '1557951': 1, '17851847': 1, '6498740': 1, '8443097': 1, '7211503': 1, '17618441': 1, '12923349': 1, '10919350': 1, '7477865': 1, '15543013': 1, '31179415': 1, '16644412': 1, '8480509': 1, '1459023': 1, '34741004': 1, '19521134': 1, '9746306': 1, '11893894': 1, '6695558': 1, '16412839': 1, '660217': 1, '3140477': 1, '15143993': 1, '8666374': 1, '7622703': 1, '1885984': 1, '9743959': 1, '26081826': 2, '6565539': 1, '1924283': 1, '25126436': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4508570-1': 1}"}
