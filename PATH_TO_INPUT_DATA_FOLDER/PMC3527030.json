Chest radiograph showed two water opacity in the right thorax suggesting hydatidosis, hydatid serology was positive and chest CT evoked triple location of right pulmonary hydatidosis (, ). Through the sixth posterolateral thoracotomy, exploration showed location of three extrapulmonary hydatid cysts: one was located in the anterior chest wall parallel to sternal line, the second in the lateral chest wall and the third have diaphragmatic location with mediastinum and chest wall extension, this cyst compressed the lung with dense adhesions (, ). Subtotal cystotomy was performed for the diaphragmatic cyst because of dense adhesion to the mediastinal structures, and the two chest wall cysts were resected completely with associated pleurectomy because of pleura involvement.
