Left breast was normal. There was no history of infection, trauma, pain, itching, and discharge from the nipple. General physical and systemic examination was within normal limits. On cutaneous examination, there was a dome-shaped mass of 1 cm \u00d7 2 cm present on the right nipple. On palpation, the lesion was freely movable, nontender and had a smooth surface. There was no evidence of keratin-filled punctum over the lesion. Under general anesthesia, total excision of cyst was done. Histologic examination revealed that the cyst wall was lined with stratified squamous epithelium with a granular layer, which was filled with keratinous material and seen within the dermis []. Thus, the final diagnosis of EIC of the breast was made. There was no evidence of recurrence during the 1 year follow-up period after excision in both the cases.", "age": "[[3.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22199072': 1, '13457427': 1, '23112456': 1, '25695444': 1, '31015391': 1, '25275477': 1, '9371041': 1, '25124255': 1, '29552539': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5846223-1': 2}"}
