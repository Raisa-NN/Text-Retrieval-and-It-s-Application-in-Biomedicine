MRI imaging revealed a 6.4 x 4.3 x 3.8 cm multilobulated fluid collection in the supracerebellar cistern and quadrigeminal cistern consistent with a complex arachnoid cyst (Figure ). The patient agreed to participate and was explained the nature and objectives of this study, and informed consent was formally obtained. No reference to the patient's identity was made at any stage during data analysis or in the report.\\nBecause she had symptomatic hydrocephalus due to the mass effect of the arachnoid cyst, an external ventricular drain was placed into the right lateral ventricle at the time of admission. She was then taken for definitive surgical treatment with decompression and fenestration of the cyst through a superior cerebellar approach as described in detail below. She tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively recovered in the intensive care unit. Her symptoms resolved, and after a cisternogram confirmed that the cerebral aqueduct was patent with good fenestration of the arachnoid cyst (Figure ), the external ventricular drain was removed on postoperative day two.\\nThe patient did well, symptoms resolved, and on postoperative day eight she was discharged in good condition.", "age": "[[73.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'24778923': 2, '26426425': 1, '25913279': 1, '23959415': 1, '19685251': 1, '26722683': 1, '20885250': 1, '27493846': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3994713-1': 1, '3994713-2': 1}"}
