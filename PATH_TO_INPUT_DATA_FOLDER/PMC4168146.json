His medications included nebivolol, cilostazol, clopidogrel, and rosuvastatin. He referred an erythematous patch over his left scapula when discharged from the hospital.\\nThe lesion evolved in 3 months into an atrophic plaque that was pruritic, tender, and painful. Over the following 3 months, the lesion became indurated, ulcerated, developing hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation, as well as superficial telangiectasia. The lesion was well demarcated, 8 \u00d7 5 cms (). A skin biopsy specimen demonstrated changes consistent with chronic radiation dermatitis (Figures , , and ). The histological findings, along with the location over the left scapula and the history of fluoroscopic exposure during cardiac catheterization, led to the clinical diagnosis of fluoroscopy-induced chronic radiation dermatitis.\\nThe ulcer was treated with bismuth subgallate powder, applied every four days and left under occlusion. The ulcer resolved after thirty days of treatment. A hydrophilic ointment was indicated on the rest of the plaque.", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12702082': 1, '18492595': 1, '12884469': 1, '17515515': 1, '10434104': 1, '21123197': 1, '21752059': 1, '33628823': 1, '25276441': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
