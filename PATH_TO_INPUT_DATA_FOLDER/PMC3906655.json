She first noticed asymmetry of her face after a trauma she suffered about 5 years earlier. Since then the condition had gradually deteriorated and attained the present status. No information relevant to the condition was elicited from past dental, medical, and family history. On extra-oral examination, marked facial asymmetry was observed in the lower face region with deviation of chin toward the left side. Enlargement of the right side of mandible was clearly seen []. On intra-oral examination, mandibular central incisor midline was found not to coincide with facial midline. Open bite was present on the right posterior tooth region []. Panoramic radiograph revealed elongation of condyle, condylar neck, ramus and body of mandible on the right side. Horizontal dimension of the mandibular body was also larger as compared to that on the left side. The distance between the mandibular roots and the inferior alveolar nerve on the right side was more than that on the left side []. Further, CT demonstrated elongation and medial rotation of right lower border of the mandible [Figure and ]. On the basis of all these findings, diagnosis of hemimandibular hypertrophy-elongation hybrid type was confirmed.", "age": "[[18.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12387615': 1, '9971928': 1, '16191911': 1, '10790442': 1, '3461097': 1, '29782597': 1, '19164410': 1, '8711329': 1, '24516768': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3906655-1': 2}"}
