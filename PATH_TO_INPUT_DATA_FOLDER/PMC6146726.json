He had not received any blood transfusions or transplant in the past, and no panel reactive antibody was assessed before transplant. Donor was a 34-year-old female with no comorbidities and a frozen section of donor kidney before harvesting showed normal histology. The cold ischemia time was 12 h. He received induction with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (2 mg/kg) before engraftment. Post procedure, urine output was 100\u2013150 mL/h, and he was hemodynamically stable with a pulse rate of 92 per min, blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg, and temperature of 37.8\u00b0. Twelve hours later, he had a serum creatinine of 5.8 mg/dL, hemoglobin 7.5 g/dL, drain output of 600 mL and had passed more than 1500 mL of urine. Over the next 4 days, serum creatinine gradually reduced to 3.0 mg/dL. He was on standard triple drug immunosuppression of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone.\\nFifth-day posttransplant there was fall in urine output to 50 mL/h, and serum creatinine rose to 4.1 mg/dL. Concurrently, hemoglobin was 12 g/dl, total count 10500 per cu.mm with a differential count of 86% neutrophils, 8% lymphocytes, and 6% monocytes with no aberrant findings in peripheral smear. He was given 500 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days, a graft biopsy performed with a high suspicion of rejection, and thereafter initiated on plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy.\\nThe histopathology of the graft showed [] 15 glomeruli, and significant interstitial inflammation with lymphocytes and numerous eosinophils. There was evidence of glomerulitis (Banff g1) and 20% acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Peritubular capillaries (PTC) were infiltrated with lymphocytes, eosinophils, and few plasma cells amounting to Banff peritubular capillaritis score 3 (ptc3). Immunofluorescent staining showed strongly positive C4d in PTC. The tissue was abound with eosinophils effectuating eosinophilic glomerulitis, interstitial nephritis, and peritubular capillaritis. Graft eosinophilia accounted for more than 15% of the interstitial infiltrates. Eosinophils were farther from the site of ATN, and there was no evidence of tubulitis. These findings were consistent with an eosinophil-rich acute antibody-mediated rejection.\\nHe received a total of 7 sessions of plasma exchange and 75 g of IVIG followed by bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2/dose for 4 doses (day 1, 4, 7, 11). The graft function improved with urine output of 4 l/day and serum creatinine reaching 1.9 mg/dl at 17 days posttransplant. Thereupon, a repeat graft biopsy was performed [Figure and ]. The specimen was inadequate with 2 glomeruli but had a long segment of medulla showing resolution of the inflammation and Banff ptc1. Circumferential positivity of C4d in PTC persisted (Banff score \u2013 g0, t0, i1, v0, cg0, ct0, ci0, cv0, aah0, ptc1, C4d3).\\nNinety days after transplant, a third biopsy was carried out which revealed 8 glomeruli of which 3 were sclerosed [ and ]. Nevertheless, there were no tubulitis, interstitial inflammation, peritubular capillaritis, glomerulitis, or C4d positivity. Four months posttransplant, his serum creatinine is 1.6 mg/dL.", "age": "[[22.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'8476270': 1, '28356665': 1, '3279576': 1, '8247197': 1, '11118099': 1, '3520986': 1, '2449924': 1, '7573019': 1, '1596561': 1, '18727793': 1, '15729171': 1, '11323281': 1, '10751052': 1, '30271003': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
