During a visit to her general practitioner for a routine check-up, a significant inflammatory syndrome was found on blood tests with a high erythrocyte sedimentation sate (>120 mm/h) and C reactive protein (70\u2013140 mg/L) associated with an inflammatory anaemia (Hb 95 g/L). At this time, the patient complained of atypical pain in the shoulder girdle and a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) was suspected. Therefore, corticosteroid treatment was initiated. The joint symptoms disappeared, but the inflammatory syndrome remained fairly elevated. The patient had no B symptoms. She was a non-smoker and drank alcohol 2 to 3 times a month. There were no previous cancers in the family history.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8463615': 1, '21912492': 1, '12576929': 1, '331419': 1, '24826064': 1, '25824138': 1, '11148717': 1, '7978895': 1, '10955865': 1, '12569593': 1, '5923101': 1, '31365752': 1, '31505502': 1, '18486921': 1, '23702365': 1, '3966721': 1, '8122637': 1, '30643566': 1, '22194442': 1, '23008293': 1, '34088689': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
