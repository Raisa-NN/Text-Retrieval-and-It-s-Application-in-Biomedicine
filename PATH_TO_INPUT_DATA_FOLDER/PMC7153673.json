She reported fatigue and unintentional weight loss, but no other constitutional symptoms. There was no clinical evidence of bleeding or peripheral neuropathy; however, she was experiencing intermittent headaches and blurred vision, concerning for potential hyperviscosity syndrome. There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.\\nLaboratory testing demonstrated white blood cell count of 3.3 \u00d7 109/L (normal 4.5 \u2013 11 \u00d7 109/L), hemoglobin of 104 g/L (normal 120 - 160 g/L), mean cell volume of 95 fL (normal 80 - 98 fL), platelet count of 144 \u00d7 109/L (normal 140 - 440 \u00d7109/L), and LDH of 140 U/L (normal 120 - 230 U/L). There was mild hypercalcemia (corrected calcium 2.67 mmol/L; normal 2.1 - 2.6 mmol/L), but otherwise normal electrolytes, renal and liver function. Total serum protein was elevated at 116 g/L (normal 60 - 80 g/L). Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrated an IgM lambda monoclonal protein of 50 g/L, with an elevated serum viscosity ratio (at 37 degrees) of 7.8 (normal 1.1 - 1.8) and beta-2 microglobulin of 2.6 mg/L (normal 1.1 - 2.4g/L). There were no osseous lesions identified on skeletal survey.\\nBone marrow aspirate and biopsy demonstrated a hypercellular marrow with extensive plasma cell infiltration in large sheets (91.4% of 500 cell differential; ). Lymphocytes were rare, accounting for 1% in the 500 cell differential (). Tri-lineage hematopoiesis was markedly decreased with otherwise unremarkable morphology. No amyloid deposits were seen, and Congo red staining was negative. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a marked increase in CD138+ (), lambda restricted monotypic plasma cells (), which were BCL1+, CD20- and CD56-. Flow cytometry revealed a population of clonal lambda-restricted plasma cells that were CD38+, CD138+, CD56-, CD19+, CD20-, and CD117-, and a separate a clonal B cell population which were CD19+, CD20+ (dim), surface lambda+ (dim), CD10+ (dim), and CD38+ (high). The flow cytometry findings suggested a B cell lymphoma with plasma cell differentiation.\\nWhile the morphologic findings favored a diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma, the composite of the patient\u2019s clinical presentation and immunophenotypic findings favored a diagnosis of WM. She was started on bendamustine with the later addition of rituximab, and completed six cycles with resolution of her symptoms and a notable decrease in monoclonal paraproteinemia, supporting our presumptive diagnosis.", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8490175': 1, '14631546': 1, '19287458': 1, '11358356': 1, '17210522': 1, '12720118': 1, '21757593': 1, '32300437': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
