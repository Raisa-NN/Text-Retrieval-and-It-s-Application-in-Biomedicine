CT showed a fracture line from the iliac metaphyseal through the triradiate cartilage to the ischiadic metaphyseal and was classified as type IV TCI(Fig. A,B). After the essential condition is stable, the right femur neck was performed ORIF(Fig. C). One year later, MRI showed partial necrosis and collapse of the femoral head, with the triradiate cartilage had no bone bridge formation(Fig. D). Four years after the operation, the patient had mild claudication with dysfunction such as squatting and stocking. X-ray showed slightly oblique acetabulum and necrosis of femoral head.", "age": "[[5.1, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12813353': 1, '23673424': 1, '8915922': 1, '17762485': 1, '30889165': 2, '9160952': 1, '8050221': 1, '681376': 1, '7068702': 1, '18510160': 1, '14676547': 1, '6770643': 1, '29309383': 1, '4717103': 1, '3339056': 1, '24879360': 1, '103880': 1, '3549091': 1, '15614056': 1, '34376165': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8356404-1': 2, '8356404-2': 2, '6502156-1': 1}"}
