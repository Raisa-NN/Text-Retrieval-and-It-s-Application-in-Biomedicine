She consulted her GP who advised an US scan. This revealed a lump over the dorsum of the left foot on the lateral side. She also had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan which was indeterminate ( and ). It was reported as a suspected sarcoma. She was then referred to the Sheffield sarcoma unit where she underwent a biopsy of the swelling; which was reported as angiomyolipoma (a benign swelling). She was not keen on excision initially, but as the swelling increased in size and started becoming painful, she underwent an excision of the lesion under our care and the histopathologic examination of the excised sample confirmed it to be angioleiomyoma. The post-operative period was uneventful and she was discharged from our care after 10 weeks. At this time, she was symptom-free and had a pain score of 0/10.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17880879': 1, '19457791': 1, '8245243': 1, '9274095': 1, '12709005': 1, '9557795': 1, '23011622': 1, '25075360': 2, '23634427': 1, '9486670': 1, '34909169': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8666195-1': 2, '4113697-1': 1, '4113697-2': 1}"}
