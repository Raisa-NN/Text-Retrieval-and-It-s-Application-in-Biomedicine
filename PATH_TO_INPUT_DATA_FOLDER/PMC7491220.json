Endoscopy found a complete duodenal occlusion. Endoscopic duodenoduodenostomy was performed using a 15 mm wide Hot AXIOS\u2122 stent; the patient resumed oral feeding 1 day after the procedure. One month later, the stent was easily removed and the tract presented a good patency. The 2-month control endoscopy showed a patent tract, with a smooth scope passage (). However, dilation was performed with an 18 mm diameter balloon before diversion reversal in order to consolidate patency and allow fully solid food intake.", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23898381': 1, '20872979': 1, '3592810': 1, '6838368': 1, '19637123': 1, '21792721': 1, '28114688': 1, '34027253': 2, '20421101': 1, '18083080': 1, '27633158': 1, '24472762': 1, '26427001': 1, '23188662': 1, '28724308': 1, '32974023': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7491220-1': 2, '7491220-2': 2, '8117746-1': 1}"}
