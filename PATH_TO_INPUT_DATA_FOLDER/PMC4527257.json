She had undergone pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour three months previously. The patient had tachycardia and icterus, and abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the upper abdomen. Serum amylase, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated. Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) of the abdomen revealed a markedly dilated afferent loop of gastro-jejunal (GJ) anastomosis () with normal efferent loops. The intra-hepatic biliary radicals, common bile duct and pancreatic duct were also dilated ( and ). Gastroscopy revealed an obstruction in the afferent loop, 2 cm beyond the anastomosis, and there was marked difficulty in progressing beyond this narrowing. The afferent loop beyond the obstruction was markedly dilated and filled with bilious fluid (). No mass or ulcerations were observed at or near the obstruction and there was a sharp bend. Around one litre of bilious fluid was sucked out and a naso-jejunal (NJ) tube was put in place for further decompression (). Following this, the patients improved markedly and the NJ tube was removed after two weeks. The patient is currently asymptomatic after one month of follow-up.", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15741008': 1, '11923786': 1, '23837955': 1, '428293': 1, '2436970': 1, '33612115': 2, '9365139': 1, '2048535': 1, '22800503': 2, '10887240': 1, '23110908': 1, '2442795': 1, '24112370': 1, '22741115': 2, '23789653': 1, '21623598': 1, '2360186': 1, '24939738': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7898437-1': 1, '3363051-1': 1, '3363051-2': 1, '3423048-1': 1}"}
