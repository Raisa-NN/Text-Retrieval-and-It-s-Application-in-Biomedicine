She was started on clonazepam (0.25 mg orally twice a day) for myoclonus approximately two weeks prior. Her other medicines included erythropoietin, felodipine, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, labetalol, folic acid, and daily vitamin B complex. She received two units of packed red blood cells for worsening anemia, with a hemoglobin value of 6 g/dL. Post-transfusion complete blood count (CBC) revealed a hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL (MCV 92 fL), white blood cell (WBC) count of 460/\u03bcL (absolute neutrophil count of 69/\u03bcL), and platelet count of 89,640/\u03bcL. She subsequently developed fever and chills and was admitted to the hospital the following day.\\nOn the day of admission, CBC showed a WBC count of 386/\u03bcL (absolute neutrophil count of 49/\u03bcL), hemoglobin of 8.17 g/dL (MCV 91.2 fL), and platelet count of 62,300/\u03bcL. Blood culture was obtained which exhibited no growth of microorganisms. She was empirically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Evaluation for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses were negative. Antinuclear antibody study was non-reactive. Both folate and vitamin B12 levels were within normal ranges. Peripheral blood smear revealed pancytopenia without leukemic blasts. A bone marrow biopsy predominately consisted of adipose tissue, with significantly decreased myeloid and erythroid precursors, as well as megakaryocytes, reflecting a 10-20% overall cellularity (Figs. and ). No aggregates of blasts or atypical cells were identified. Review of medications suggested that clonazepam, which was added to the patient's regimen two weeks prior to admission, most likely precipitated pancytopenia. Clonazepam was consequently discontinued. Her other medications were maintained. The thrombocytopenia resolved in four days, and neutropenia gradually improved within 1-2 weeks. She was discharged about a week from the day of admission, with CBC showing WBC count of 1,460/\u03bcL, hemoglobin of 7.56 g/dL, and platelet count of 246,000/\u03bcL.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15567546': 1, '19330803': 1, '23736912': 1, '973817': 1, '1192127': 1, '6417963': 1, '7062487': 1, '11926789': 1, '24619070': 1, '3133076': 1, '33549083': 2, '22058654': 1, '20630089': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7866469-1': 1}"}
