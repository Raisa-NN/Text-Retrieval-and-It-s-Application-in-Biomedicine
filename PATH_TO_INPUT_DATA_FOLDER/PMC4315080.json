There was no change in her bowel habit and she had no other systemic symptoms. She had a PMH of a right-sided ovarian cyst detected on an ultrasound that she had for lower abdominal pain sometimes ago. She had no previous abdominal surgery. On examination, she was afebrile and haemodynamically stable. The abdomen was distended with mild tenderness in the RIF. DRE revealed an empty rectum.\\nHaemoglobin was 12.6 g/dl and a WCC of 8.3 \u00d7 109/l. Other remarkable laboratory tests included a CRP of 19 mg/l. Urinalysis was normal. The AXR revealed a grossly distended large bowel. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed that the rectum, sigmoid and descending colon were collapsed with an apparent calibre change within the transverse colon with no mass lesion (Fig. ).\\nA gastrografin enema (Fig. ) failed to demonstrate any flow beyond the mid-transverse colon. A presumptive diagnosis of transverse colon obstruction was made and the patient was taken to theatre.\\nLaparotomy revealed an adhesive band extending from the gastrocolic omentum to the right fallopian tube causing a closed-loop obstruction of right half of transverse colon, ascending colon and terminal 5 cm of ileum. The band was divided. The bowel was viable. Appendicectomy was performed and most of the gas in the colon was aspirated via the appendicular stump prior to its ligation.", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'6714048': 1, '34305472': 1, '115283': 1, '18437404': 1, '274635': 1, '12450086': 1, '13360649': 1, '6875781': 1, '32577207': 2, '9362206': 1, '10535493': 1, '25650387': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4315080-1': 2, '7297551-1': 1}"}
