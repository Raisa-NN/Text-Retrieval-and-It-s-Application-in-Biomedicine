His seizures were well controlled with Valproic acid and Clobazam for the initial three years. As his first MRI [] was normal, the antiepileptic medicines were subsequently withdrawn. Since then, he has had breakthrough complex partial seizures despite being on medicine. For the last three years, he also had a hemicranial throbbing headache of moderate severity, lasting for few hours, associated with irritability and phonophobia, and intermittent vertiginous sensations, without imbalance when walking. His physical examination and neuropsychological assessment did not reveal any abnormalities; specifically, no facial port-wine stain was present. An ophthalmological examination did not reveal any abnormality, including glaucoma. For his breakthrough seizues, he was taking inadequate dosage of Oxcarbazepine and Lacosamide. His video electroencephalography (VEEG) revealed right posterior head region spike and wave discharges. A recent brain computed tomography (CT) [] showed gyral calcification over the right parietal cortex. A recent MRI [] showed focal cortical atrophy over the right parietal region and the gadolinium contrast revealed leptomeningeal angioma over the same region. The CT angiogram [] did not show any venous or arterial malformation. We put the patient on an Oxcarbazepine and Clobazam combination, and on the last follow up six months later, the patient was seen to be seizure-free.", "age": "[[7.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15295918': 1, '7769179': 1, '10870197': 1, '9050045': 1, '13677575': 1, '33482759': 1, '8216540': 1, '10914976': 1, '1635798': 1, '25552865': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
