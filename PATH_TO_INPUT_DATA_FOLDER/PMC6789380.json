Fungi and non-tuberculous mycobacteria were also not identified by tissue culture. Tissue specimens were obtained by biopsy.\\nDermoscopy revealed a clear, scaly, reddish-brown background with glomerular vessels and a scaly surface, which are specific features of BD (Figure ). Skin biopsy of the erythema on the left palm showed hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, atypical keratinocytes throughout the epidermis, most mitotic phases, disordered cell arrangement, and dyskeratotic cells; additionally, some keratinocytes were vacuolated. A moderate amount of inflammatory infiltrate was present in the upper dermis, which is consistent with BD (Figure ).", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15214896': 1, '21772615': 1, '25073963': 1, '23659186': 1, '24011322': 1, '25545216': 1, '10417369': 1, '20115962': 1, '5405303': 1, '1401276': 1, '30109890': 1, '31616711': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
