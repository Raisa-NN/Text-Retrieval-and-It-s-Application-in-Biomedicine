She was starting to experience near syncopal episodes. Her physical exam was unremarkable. An exercise stress echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 40-45%, frequent PVCs, but no evidence of ischemia. A 24-hour Holter monitor demonstrated approximately 36,000 monomorphic PVCs. Her 12 lead ECG showed monomorphic PVCs with a left bundle branch block, inferior axis pattern (). She was diagnosed with symptomatic PVCs and likely PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. After discussing her options including medical therapy versus RFCA, she decided to undergo ablation of her PVCs.\\nDuring the procedure, a right ventricular quadripolar catheter was used for pacing and surface ECGs were used as reference for mapping the PVCs. An AcuNav intracardiac ultrasound catheter (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) was placed in the RV for visualizing the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and the aortic cusps to assist with ablation. A 4 mm D-curve NaviStar ablation catheter (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) was used for mapping the RV and RVOT. 3-dimensisonal electroanatomic mapping using the CARTO system (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) was used to perform an activation map of the RVOT. This demonstrated a diffuse area within the posteroseptal aspect of the RVOT that preceded the QRS onset by approximately 5 to 10 msec. However, pace mapping in these areas did not result in any good pace matches with the culprit PVC. Therefore, the ablation catheter was advanced into the LVOT via a right femoral arterial approach for mapping. Heparin bolus followed by an infusion was initiated to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) around 250 seconds for the entire procedure. Earliest activation sites were mapped to the right coronary cusp and had the following characteristics; 1) local activation times preceded the surface QRS onset during PVCs by 20-22 msec; 2) Pace mapping in these areas demonstrated at least 11 out of 12 pace match with the culprit PVC. There were also fractionated electrograms with a good QS morphology within the unipolar electrogram. ICE images demonstrated that the ablation catheter tip was moving away form the right coronary ostium and an aortic root angiogram confirmed that these sites were at least 1 cm away from the right coronary ostium. Total duration of radiofrequency energy (RF) applications in the right coronary cusp was approximately 6 minutes, with a maximum power and temperature of 30 Watts and 55 degrees Centigrade, respectively. With each RF application, patient would go into ventricular bigeminy followed by complete loss of PVCs. This would be maintained for a few minutes after cessation of RF, followed by recurrence. It was felt that continued ablation in this area would increase procedural risk and therefore, the procedure was concluded. Patient was awake during the entire procedure. Minimal intravenous sedation was used for the entire procedure (2 mg of midazolam and 40 mg of methohexital sodium).\\nHer vital signs were stable at the end of the procedure. She was awake and alert but started to perseverate and kept asking multiple orienting questions. She also started to panic and complained about feelings of impending doom. She was oriented to person but not to place and time. She was able to recall all of the events leading to entry into the hospital, but was amnestic surrounding the procedure itself. She continually perseverated for the next 2 hours, repeating the same questions and also complained of a headache. Her clinical exam in the electrophysiology lab did not demonstrate any gross focal weakness, numbness or lateralizing sensory changes. She followed multiple-step commands without problem. There was no deficit in speech, language, or other cranial nerve function. Serum electrolytes, blood glucose level, CBC and CT scan of the brain (without contrast) were immediately done which were normal. Neurology consult was requested and she was diagnosed with transient global amnesia (TGA). Patient returned to her baseline mental status within 4 hours and was discharged home the following day. She did not have any neurological deficits at the time of discharge (except for a headache that resolved within 24 hours).", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16116014': 1, '22557845': 2, '2266362': 1, '18669495': 1, '8299284': 1, '15963447': 1, '20811535': 1, '20811539': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3337371-1': 1}"}
