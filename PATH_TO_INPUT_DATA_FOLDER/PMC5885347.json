A TRAP Sequence was diagnosed and the following findings were identified: the UA S/D ratio was 6.2, the DV Doppler flow showed an abnormal resistance but no abnormal a-wave, the MCA-PI was 2.0, and the MCA-PSV was 31. The left sided Tei index was 0.55.\\nWe explained the pathophysiology of a TRAP Sequence in detail. Since we suspected cardiac dysfunction of the pump twin, an emergent intrauterine radiofrequency ablation of the cord for the acardiac twin was offered but the patient declined and opted for a second opinion.\\nThe patient presented 4 days later with decreased fetal movement and an ultrasound confirmed a fetal demise of the pump twin.\\nInduction of labor with misoprostol was started and 16 hours later the fetuses were delivered. The pump twin had an EFW of 452 grams and the acardiac twin weighed 388 grams. The patient was discharged on postpartum day 1.", "age": "[[22.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16958150': 1, '27358695': 1, '26577371': 1, '11483917': 1, '17904976': 1, '2206078': 1, '12528158': 1, '21268037': 1, '17466701': 1, '12221401': 1, '14528480': 1, '11723840': 1, '29765784': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5885347-1': 2, '5885347-2': 2}"}
