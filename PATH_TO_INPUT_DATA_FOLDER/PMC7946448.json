After complete resection of the adenoma by ESD technique, there was an extensive mucosal defect. We initially performed electrocoagulation on the bleeding mucosa surface. The mucosal defect was so big that it was technically difficult to close with clips. Previous studies suggested that complete closure of the mucosal defect after ESD significantly decreased delayed adverse events (bleeding or perforation). Then, we applied clip-with-line traction suture technique to completely close the mucosal defect. The patient was given the fluid diet for three days and discharged seven days after ESD procedure without any complaints ().", "age": "[[66.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27468186': 1, '23251884': 1, '29207854': 1, '19111686': 1, '33747077': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7946448-1': 2, '7946448-2': 2}"}
