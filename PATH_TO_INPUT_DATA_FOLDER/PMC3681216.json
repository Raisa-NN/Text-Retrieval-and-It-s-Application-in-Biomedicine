Selective angiography of the left renal artery was performed revealing eccentric subtotal 98% occlusion ().\\nRenal artery angioplasty was decided, and the same procedural steps were performed as described in Case 1, but instead of a 0.014\u2033 Quickcross catheter (Spectranetics), we used an OTW Sprinter (Medtronic) 2.5 \u00d7 12 mm balloon.\\nA 6.0 \u00d7 15 mm Herculink Elite RX stent (Abbott) was deployed across the lesion. Subsequent angiography revealed optimal stent deployment and absence of complications (). Overall, less than 15 cc of contrast was used for the renal angioplasty. Three weeks after the procedure, creatinine was stable and blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg on two antihypertensive medications (decreased from three prior to procedure).", "age": "[[83.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10348553': 1, '19463421': 1, '23819096': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3681216-1': 2}"}
