Five years ago, he had already received a surgery for that mass at a regional hospital. At that time, the pathology confirmed the cavernous hemangioma. However, the mass has slowly regrown at the same region for the five years. His neck motions were limited. An enhanced CT scan showed approximately 5\u00d73\u00d75 cm sized well margined and multi-nodular calcified mass in the posterior neck muscle layer. The density of mass was similar to the surrounding muscles (). The mass was iso- to high signal intensity with low signal calcified lesion on the T1-weighted and high- to intermediated signal intensity with fluid-fluid level on the T2-weighted images. A T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced sagittal MRI revealed heterogeneous signal intensity between the trapezius and splenius capitis muscle and further enhanced as time passed (). Surgery was performed using a horizontal skin incision and the mass was removed completely. Grossly the mass contained many vascular channels with focal bone formation (). Pathological result was cavernous hemangioma (). Postoperatively, his neck motions such as shoulder shrugging, neck extension, lateral flexion and rotation were normal. At the moment of a year passing, there is no evidence of recurrence.", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18207684': 1, '15936911': 1, '11932639': 1, '32872061': 2, '17438470': 1, '5061701': 1, '3968956': 1, '17821925': 1, '17225132': 1, '12011711': 1, '3864109': 1, '12447041': 1, '1992855': 1, '15224828': 1, '25983801': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7437785-1': 1}"}
