Following the first cycle of chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin, the patient developed asymptomatic juicy erythematous papules on the neck, trunk and limbs (Figure ). Histology revealed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the epidermis and prominent neutrophilic dermal infiltrates forming occasional microabscesses (Figure ). The abscesses appeared to be associated with the epidermal downgrowths, with strands of mitotically active atypical squamous epithelium. Superficially this resembled squamous carcinoma. On a high-power view, these strands were frequently attached to or formed part of eccrine coils or ducts, and occasionally cuticles were seen (Figure ). The appearances fall into the NEH/eccrine squamous syringometaplasia (ESS) spectrum. Mometasone furoate 0.1% was prescribed, and the patient continued on chemotherapy consisting of fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and idarubicin. No further skin lesions were reported.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21971279': 1, '23543588': 2, '17214733': 1, '10101565': 1, '28581221': 1, '11534910': 1, '6950689': 1, '29469718': 1, '17109994': 1, '10856664': 1, '32064208': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3608306-1': 1}"}
