Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS. Fundus examination disclosed CME OS, confirmed with fluorescein angiography and OCT at 442 microns thickness. In addition, there was an amelanotic choroidal melanoma with basal dimension of 12 mm. B-scan ultrasonography revealed a 3.1-mm thick, acoustically hollow mass []. There was no retinal invasion, but overlying RPE atrophy was found. The melanoma was treated with two sessions of photodynamic therapy plus additional intravitreal bevacizumab for CME. At 16 months, tumor regression to 2.5 mm was documented and visual acuity was stable at 20/40 OD, with reduction in CME to 392 microns.", "age": "[[13.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'4666929': 1, '718503': 1, '7294109': 1, '11914216': 1, '23440248': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3574517-1': 2}"}
