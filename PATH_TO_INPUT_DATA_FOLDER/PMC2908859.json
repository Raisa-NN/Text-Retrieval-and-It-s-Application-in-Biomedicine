The scar dated back to a traffic accident that happened more than eight years prior.\\nAn ocular examination was performed, and an erythematous, firm, and non-tender mass was diffusely palpable along the upper and lower eyelid scar ().\\nWe performed an incisional biopsy of the mass on the patient's lower eyelid. Histopathologic examination revealed numerous, noncaseating granulomas with multi-nucleated giant cells, surrounded by relatively few lymphocytes (). The giant cells contained asteroid bodies and calcium oxalate crystals, characteristic of sarcoidosis (, ). Ziehl-Neelsen staining failed to locate any acid-fast bacilli, and GMS (Gomori methenamine acid) staining ruled out the presence of fungal organisms. In addition, polarizing light microscopy did not reveal any foreign material. Laboratory studies were performed, but failed to demonstrate any evidence of systemic sarcoidosis.\\nIntralesional triamcinolone (4 mg/0.1 cc) 0.6 cc was injected in several fractions at 1-cm intervals along the upper lid mass. After one month, there was dramatic resolution of the lesions in the area that received treatment (). An additional dose of 1cc triamcinolone was injected in the masses of the upper and lower lids two months after the first injection. No palpable mass was present one year after the treatment.", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9536554': 1, '4432869': 1, '31048763': 1, '25819832': 1, '1395154': 1, '678730': 1, '26593141': 1, '14964632': 1, '28775813': 1, '34414097': 1, '6488586': 1, '10461661': 1, '4646848': 1, '7825675': 1, '2207873': 1, '17302211': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
