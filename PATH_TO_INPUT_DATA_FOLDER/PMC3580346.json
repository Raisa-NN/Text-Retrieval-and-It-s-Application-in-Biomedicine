He had referred to another center, where the dorsum defect was skin-grafted. Seven years after the initial trauma, he applied to our department. The free TDAP flap was planned for reconstruction. During the operation, the scar tissue was completely removed. The free TDAP flap flap 16 \u00d7 9 cm in size was designed and elevated to transfer the defect. The thoracodorsal artery and vein of flap were anastomosed to the posterior tibial artery and vein. The flap donor site was closed primarily without grafting. The patient was fully mobilized 3 weeks after the reconstruction. The follow-up period was 17 months. Flap contour was good, and no debulking procedures were required [].", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17471139': 1, '16129226': 1, '29037204': 1, '18692966': 1, '15780233': 1, '18300968': 1, '2018913': 1, '18548404': 1, '19407627': 1, '20589498': 1, '21610308': 1, '19568084': 1, '15308400': 1, '12372367': 1, '19034076': 1, '8937603': 1, '15220564': 1, '16141821': 1, '21207494': 1, '12134584': 1, '16772958': 1, '11214052': 1, '16284951': 1, '16651939': 1, '19477600': 1, '18683864': 1, '2605399': 1, '7480280': 1, '16557084': 1, '23450715': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3580346-1': 2, '3580346-2': 2, '3580346-3': 2}"}
