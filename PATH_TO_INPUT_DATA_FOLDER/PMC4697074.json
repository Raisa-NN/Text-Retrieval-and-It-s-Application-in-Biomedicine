She noticed bruise and pain over her left great toe afterwards. She consulted the family doctor and was treated as soft tissue contusion with buddy splint and analgesics. However, she still experienced severe great toe pain with shoe gear and walking. Radiograph of her left foot was then taken and showed avulsion fracture of the lateral side of the base of her left great toe. She was referred to our clinic 5 weeks after the injury. Clinical examination showed left hallux varus () and increased ease of passive abduction of the left great toe as compared to the right side (see Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at ). Operative reconstruction of the lateral stabilizer of the 1st MTPJ was suggested but she refused initially. However, her left great toe symptoms persisted and she finally agreed about operation. Operation was performed 5 months after the injury. First MTP arthroscopy showed intact cartilage with diffuse synovitis and arthroscopic synovectomy was performed. Minimally invasive EHB tenodesis was then performed to correct the hallux varus. Plantar plate tenodesis was also performed to correct the symptomatic clawing of the 2nd toe.", "age": "[[68.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19796598': 1, '34868846': 1, '3404410': 1, '10789103': 1, '8070193': 1, '6470431': 1, '7274889': 1, '8821281': 1, '8821282': 1, '1025195': 1, '26793399': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
