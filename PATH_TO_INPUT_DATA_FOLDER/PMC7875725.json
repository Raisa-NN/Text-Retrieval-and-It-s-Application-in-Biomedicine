We noted prolonged weaning with unsuccessful spontaneous breathing trials. Tracheostomy was performed after 22 days after the onset of symptoms and 16 days of mechanical ventilation. Weaning of mechanical ventilation was successful after 5 days of tracheostomy. The patient\u00b4s comfort and her ability to communicate was improved.
