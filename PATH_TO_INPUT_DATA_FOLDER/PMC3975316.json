She had not been diagnosed with abnormal glucose tolerance before pregnancy, and she had no family history of diabetes mellitus. At the age of 20 years, she underwent unilateral tubectomy because of ectopic pregnancy.\\nAfter she became pregnant naturally, she received prenatal care in a private clinic. Her random plasma glucose level was 140 mg/dl at 8 weeks of gestation, but a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (75-g OGTT) at 11 weeks showed that her glucose tolerance was normal. At 28 weeks of gestation, she was referred to our hospital because of severe general fatigue and a random plasma glucose level of 489 mg/dl. Her pre-pregnancy BMI was 19.9. Her blood pressure was 110/84 mmHg, heart rate 106 beats/min, and body temperature 36.5 \u00b0C. Physical examination showed Kussmaul breathing with ketotic odor. The laboratory findings are summarized in . Importantly, anion gap showed 21.9, suggesting presence of metabolic acidosis. No obvious non-reassuring fetal status was recognized.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'29523603': 1, '20144177': 1, '21697073': 1, '19837918': 1, '17921013': 1, '32313772': 2, '1750458': 1, '31089509': 2, '14581155': 1, '19564476': 1, '18588610': 1, '19727659': 1, '29971100': 1, '24711923': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7164719-1': 1, '6484907-1': 1}"}
