The pain was initially associated with exertion, but also occurred at rest on the morning that he was admitted to the hospital. He was a chronic smoker and a hypertensive for seven years, and diabetes and hyperlipidemia were newly diagnosed. On a physical examination, he had a heart rate of 96 beats/min and a blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg. Electrocardiography showed ST elevations in leads II, III, AVF. Serial cardiac enzyme levels were elevated. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% and hypokinesia in the inferior free wall.\\nThe patient was admitted to the coronary intensive care unit with a diagnosis of acute inferior myocardial infarction. He underwent thrombolytic treatment with streptokinase, and subcutaneous enoxaparin, oral aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol and atorvastatin. Coronary angiography revealed segmental ectasia in all three coronary arteries. He had no thrombotic occlusion in all three coronary arteries, probably due to the reperfusion after thrombolytic therapy. But he did have a non-critical lesion in the mid left anterior descending artery (). The patient was discharged with medical therapy on the fourth day.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30249813': 1, '25278965': 1, '19833598': 1, '31847810': 2, '20378518': 1, '12845190': 1, '6847792': 1, '4052280': 1, '12659991': 1, '2010241': 1, '14025069': 1, '17477987': 1, '22787477': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3390432-1': 2, '6915935-1': 1}"}
