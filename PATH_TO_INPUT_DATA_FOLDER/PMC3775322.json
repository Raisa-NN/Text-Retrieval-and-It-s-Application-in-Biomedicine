He had a two-year history of palpitations on exertion with associated pre-syncopal symptoms and one syncopal episode.\\nThe 12-lead ECG on admission showed ventricular bigeminy and telemetry revealed multiple short runs of monomorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) of similar morphology to the VEs, and without haemodynamic compromise (). The QRS morphology of the ectopic beats was of left bundle branch block morphology, transition by V3/V4, superior axis and positive deflection in leads I and aVL, suggestive of a basal right ventricular origin. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis of the LV with moderately reduced ejection fraction of 44% and prominent trabeculation of the lateral and apical walls. The RV was structurally normal.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15250854': 1, '24669110': 1, '24669112': 1, '24669111': 1, '11711464': 1, '24669113': 1, '9005281': 1, '2372897': 1, '32494459': 1, '15992642': 1, '24130428': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
