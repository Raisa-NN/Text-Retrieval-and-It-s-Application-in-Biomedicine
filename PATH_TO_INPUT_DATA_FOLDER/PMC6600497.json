She subsequently underwent cyst aspiration of all four cysts in 2016 for\\nsymptomatic relief utilizing an 18-G needle with 12-mL syringe and 1% lidocaine for\\nlocal anesthetic. Two years later, the patient returned for her first routine\\nscreening mammogram after her aspiration, resulting in a recall (BI-RADS 0) for\\nbilateral AD at the site of prior cyst aspirations ( and ). The AD persisted bilaterally on\\ndiagnostic mammography and was without sonographic correlates on ultrasound. The\\ndiagnostic study was coded BI-RADS 4, biopsy recommended, for suspicious bilateral\\nAD. Targeted bilateral tomosynthesis-guided needle biopsy using a Mammotome Revolve\\n8-G vacuum needle mated to a Hologic Affirm prone biopsy table was performed, which\\nrevealed focal fibrosis and hemosiderin laden macrophages on pathology ( and ). The pathology results were\\ndetermined to be concordant with radiologic findings, given the histologic findings\\nand characteristic location overlying areas of prior cyst aspiration.", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'29629810': 1, '24529951': 1, '28710582': 1, '24147494': 1, '19610284': 1, '30242581': 1, '28834441': 1, '26587943': 1, '24951218': 1, '30240306': 1, '26963448': 1, '31285852': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
