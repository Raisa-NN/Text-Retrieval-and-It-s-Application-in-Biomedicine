He had experienced intermittent chest pain for one week prior to presentation. Upon admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg and his pulse rate was 70 beats/minute. His physical examination was unremarkable. His routine biochemistry laboratory parameters and full blood cell count were normal. A chest radiograph did not show indications of left-sided cardiac failure. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained without chest pain in the patient showed normal sinus rhythm at 63 beats/minute without Q waves and with a normal QRS width (Figure ). The echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction without regional motion abnormalities. The patient was referred for exercise testing using a standard Bruce protocol. The test was stopped at minute 10 of the protocol because the patient was experiencing fatigue, had an increasing heart rate of 148 beats/minute (87% of maximal predicted heart rate), had maximal blood pressure of 183/98 mmHg, and had a workload of 12.8 metabolic equivalents without clinical symptoms or ECG abnormalities. At minute one of the recovery phase, the ECG showed a giant R wave pattern in the inferolateral leads, including an increase of R wave voltage rising to 34 mm, loss of S wave, and merging of the QRS complex with the ST segment, causing a monophasic QRS-ST complex (Figure ). A nodal rhythm was also observed (Figure ). Clinically, the patient experienced chest pain and dizziness. His blood pressure was 183/98 mmHg, and we administered sublingual nitroglycerin, and the patient's ECG gradually returned to normal status (Figure ). In Figure , we show the evolution in lead III during the episode. The maximal level of troponin I measured after the ETT was 0.1 ng/mL (normal 0.0 ng/mL to 0.2 ng/mL). Emergency coronary arteriography showed single coronary vessel disease with severe stenosis in a mid-dominant circumflex coronary artery (Figure ). The patient was successfully treated with coronary percutaneous revascularization (Figure ), and, two days later, he was discharged without further symptoms.", "age": "[[51.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16889844': 1, '939022': 1, '15286937': 1, '30817596': 2, '3579066': 1, '8433057': 1, '13738072': 1, '8517412': 1, '28560126': 2, '21745406': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5446222-1': 1, '6831224-1': 1}"}
