Her past medical history was significant for a pituitary adenoma, which had been resected two years prior. Electrocardiogram (EKG) on presentation showed sinus bradycardia (55 beats per min) with frequent premature ventricular ectopy and prolonged QT intervals (550 msec). Echocardiogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction 10% with right ventricular dysfunction. She underwent cardiac catheterization and no significant coronary disease was identified. Cardiac index was measured at 1.2 L/min/kg and, as a result, she was placed on norepinephrine and dobutamine infusions for hemodynamic support. During catheterization, the patient acutely decompensated, developing hypoxia and mental status change. Arterial blood gas drawn at the outside hospital recorded a PaO2 of 37 mmHg with O2 saturation 69% on a non-rebreathing facemask. She required emergent intubation and was admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) at the outside institution for further management. While in the CCU, she continued to develop unstable ventricular tachycardia refractory to medical management, including the administration of multiple anti-arrhythmic medications and defibrillation. She was hypotensive with a mean arterial pressure of 55 mmHg, requiring high dose of norepinephrine (0.6 mic/kg/min) and dobutamine (10 mic/kg/min). She was also hypoxic requiring 100% FiO2 to maintain appropriate oxygen saturation. Due to hemodynamic instability, she was placed on VA-ECMO via bilateral groin access and transferred to our institution for further management.\\nRepeated echo at our institution showed cardiac standstill (Video ).\\nA routine admission laboratory panel revealed hypocalcemia, elevated lactate, hyperglycemia with a normal renal and hepatic functions (Table ). Shortly after admission, she was noted to be producing large amounts of urine. Her urine output was measured at 8 liters over the first 12 hours at our institution. Initially, VA-ECMO flow was restricted to 2-2.4 L/min, most likely due to hypovolemia. Aggressive fluid replacement therapy was initiated and ECMO flow improved to 4.5 L/min. A subsequent endocrine panel was abnormal (Table ).\\nEndocrine and nephrology were consulted to assist with the diagnosis and treatment plan. Based on the history of pituitary resection, as well as the discovery that the patient was noncompliant with her medications for approximately six months prior to presentation, it was believed her numerous endocrine abnormalities and cardiogenic shock were secondary to acute panhypopituitarism. Initial treatment included intravenous fluid replacement for central diabetes insipidus, intravenous levothyroxine for hypothyroidism (50 mcg daily), corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency (100 mg every eight hours), and calcium replacement (1000 mg three times a day). As her fluid balance normalized, her lactic acidosis eventually resolved.\\nAfter three days of ECMO support and medical treatment, a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) confirmed improving left and right ventricular function. An ECMO weaning trial with decreased ECMO flow was conducted on ECMO day 4 and she was decannulated from ECMO support on ECMO day 5. Inotropic support was not required after post-decannulation. Echocardiography after ECMO removal showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% and normal right ventricular function (Video ).\\nAfter being successfully weaned from ECMO therapy, the patient was transitioned to oral prednisone (5 mg daily) for adrenal insufficiency, oral levothyroxine (100 mcg daily) for hypothyroidism, and intravenous calcitriol (1 mcg daily) and oral calcium carbonate (1,000 mg three times daily) for hypocalcemia. She was extubated and liberated from mechanical ventilation on post-decannulation day 3. She was then transferred back to the referral facility on post-decannulation day 7 and eventually discharged to a rehabilitation facility and home without recurrence of heart failure symptoms.", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'10744801': 1, '20660814': 1, '29376070': 1, '32309255': 2, '17079038': 1, '10779002': 1, '20178564': 2, '26790380': 1, '19110971': 1, '15632316': 1, '22956554': 1, '34213484': 2, '30546710': 1, '24753807': 2, '27980741': 1, '16711315': 1, '20622352': 2, '27811932': 1, '24172274': 1, '26299943': 1, '31497426': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8378457-1': 1, '2931786-1': 1, '7162561-1': 1, '2844359-1': 1, '3992346-1': 1}"}
