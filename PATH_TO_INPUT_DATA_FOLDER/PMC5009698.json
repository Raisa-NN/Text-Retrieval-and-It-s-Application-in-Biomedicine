In April 2009, a pretreatment MRI showed multilevel DDD from L3\u2013L4 to L5\u2013S1 levels, with disc protrusions at both L4\u2013L5 and L5\u2013S1 levels. At the L5\u2013S1 level, the posterior disc height was measured at 5.8 mm and the protrusion at 6.5 mm (Fig. e left). After being explained the experimental nature of the proposed procedure, informed consent was obtained. In August 2009, this patient received an intra-discal injection of 35.9 million autologous, hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived MSCs. Cells were injected into the posterior annulus fibrosus of the L5\u2013S1 intervertebral disc. No complications occurred during the procedure and no adverse events were reported directly following the procedure. The patient returned for a follow-up examination in July 2014 consisting of a physical examination, completion of a quality of life questionnaire, and a lumbar MRI. The lumbar MRI post MSC transplantation showed no neoplasms or abnormalities surrounding the treated region. MRI measurement showed maintenance of the posterior disc height (5.8 mm) and a 48 % reduction of the disc protrusion from 6.5 to 3.4 mm (Fig. e right). Based on the quality of life questionnaire, the patient self-reported an overall improvement of 80\u201390 % post stem cell transplant in addition to an increase in strength and range of motion (Table ). No adverse events were reported due to the stem cell procedure based on the quality of life questionnaire and the physical examination.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34373704': 1, '20133815': 1, '34376494': 1, '24420906': 1, '8770872': 1, '27270495': 1, '24448028': 1, '31198585': 1, '33816523': 1, '30013600': 1, '27115513': 1, '32244936': 1, '30971109': 1, '30498909': 1, '33526926': 1, '27288632': 1, '25171110': 1, '23245607': 1, '31359164': 1, '27160012': 1, '28915718': 1, '30141058': 1, '22385573': 1, '9563104': 1, '27103465': 1, '20494814': 1, '27021233': 1, '29662795': 1, '23119226': 1, '27069485': 1, '15564918': 1, '33805356': 1, '34376495': 1, '27026621': 1, '18584218': 1, '16595436': 1, '28326305': 1, '11914152': 1, '32043007': 1, '30498908': 1, '33225992': 1, '26240729': 1, '29452287': 1, '25694901': 1, '22023622': 1, '31891121': 1, '26217065': 1, '31463441': 1, '32782864': 1, '15733747': 1, '29662757': 1, '34367292': 1, '30415465': 1, '24372326': 1, '28938891': 1, '12723977': 1, '32117935': 1, '32986582': 1, '32252152': 1, '31463452': 1, '31463457': 1, '26788424': 1, '27585696': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5009698-1': 2, '5009698-2': 2, '5009698-3': 2, '5009698-4': 2}"}
