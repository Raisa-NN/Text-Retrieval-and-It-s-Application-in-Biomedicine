The previous year she had an episode of labial swelling after ingesting a chocolate with hazelnut.\\nInitial diagnostic exams revealed a positive skin prick test to walnut (wheal mean diameter 5 mm; same as histamine diameter) and specific IgE for cashew nut 21.1 kU/L; walnut 10 kU/L; hazelnut 2.94 kU/L, and almond 0.46 kU/L. For a better understanding of the clinical situation, we performed ImmunoCAP ISAC that was positive for storage proteins of walnut and hazelnut, Jug r 1 and Cor a 9, with values of 0.6 and 33 ISAC Standardized Units (ISU-E), respectively, and for a specific allergen of latex (Hev b 3: 1.9 ISU-E). ImmunoCAP Specific for latex molecular allergens (Hev b 9, Hev b 11, Hev b 6.02, Hev b 6.01, Hev b 5, Hev b 3, and Hev b 1) was performed, which confirmed positivity only for Hev b 3 (2.31 kU/L).\\nA challenge test was performed with a latex glove: first with finger glove and then with whole glove, which were negative.\\nTreatment included strict elimination of peanuts and tree nuts from diet and self-injectable adrenaline.", "age": "[[5.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17590200': 1, '9600498': 1, '26633978': 1, '15784106': 1, '12915766': 1, '12440950': 1, '7751515': 1, '17638159': 1, '27335909': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
