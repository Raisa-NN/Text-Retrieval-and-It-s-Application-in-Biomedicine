A diagnosis of NSTEMI was made and the patient was taken to the catheterization lab. A cardiac catheterization revealed severe native left and right system disease (90% stenosis in left main, 90% in ostial left circumflex, and complete occlusion of the midportion of LAD () and ostium of RCA (). His three venous bypass grafts were seen to be occluded (Figures , , and ) and his LIMA was patent. The left subclavian artery had a calcified 99% ostial and proximal stenosis with 80 mm Hg gradient. His LVEF was seen to be at 35\u201340%. As he had only one patent bypass graft, NSTEMI, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and limited collaterals, this was considered as very high risk and the decision was made to perform this intervention under Impella support.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16162636': 1, '16563902': 1, '20082934': 1, '16923414': 1, '18799962': 1, '16516713': 1, '30564354': 2, '17896398': 1, '22935569': 1, '21036108': 1, '20557764': 1, '19463408': 1, '15556818': 1, '24527505': 1, '14620200': 1, '20845407': 1, '25161771': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6293178-1': 1}"}
