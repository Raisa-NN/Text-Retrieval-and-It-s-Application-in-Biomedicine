He was treated by local general practitioner with analgesics the day prior and denied preceding trauma to scrotum. But he was investigated for right hemi-scrotal pain without any history of trauma 2 months back in a peripheral hospital. He was diagnosed to have a right-sided EC and opted for conservative management.\\nOn examination, right hemi-scrotal tenderness and high riding right testis were found. Left hemi-scrotal palpation, abdominal examination, and hernial orifices were unremarkable. Urgent sonography with Doppler showed a septate cystic lesion of right epididymis, sized 4.1 cm \u00d7 1.7 cm () along with bilateral normally echogenic and perfused testes.\\nScrotal exploration under general anaesthesia was performed which revealed oedematous tunica vaginalis, age appropriately sized right testis, normal testicular appendage, and 4 cm \u00d7 2 cm sized dark haemorrhagic cystic lesion. The lesion appeared to be attached to the upper pole of right testis and was twisted for 540 degrees ().\\nCyst was untwisted () and excised, and the testis was fixed. Histopathological assessment revealed haemorrhagic EC (). Patient was discharged the next day following unremarkable recovery, with analgesics and oral antibiotics.", "age": "[[8.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24577990': 1, '22985703': 1, '29871476': 1, '31232012': 1, '26798545': 2, '33299634': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4698546-1': 1}"}
