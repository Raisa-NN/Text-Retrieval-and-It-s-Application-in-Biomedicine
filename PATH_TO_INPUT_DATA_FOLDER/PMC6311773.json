The pain was intense for the first 3 weeks and then improved with NSAID. X-ray showed a type III coccyx (curved sharply and angulated forward). Continued conservative treatment and use of a coccygeal pillow were advised.\\nCoccydynia refers to pain in and around the coccyx that can arise after major trauma (Case 7) or repetitive minor trauma (Case 6). It is a clinical diagnosis that has no definite correlation with X-ray findings. An impar ganglion block is indicated in coccydynia failing conservative treatment. Cases 6 and 7 emphasized that the clinical response, not the X-ray findings, guides treatment even in the presence of coccyx type IV on X-ray (coccyx fracture or subluxation).", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20461040': 1, '18758360': 1, '18026865': 1, '21123625': 1, '26564689': 1, '19747657': 1, '17530380': 1, '18301930': 1, '28087891': 1, '20977958': 1, '9664748': 1, '17905946': 1, '31001552': 1, '29406997': 1, '12380550': 1, '28196803': 1, '13810738': 1, '29447493': 1, '18246000': 1, '16374405': 1, '21868059': 1, '21824580': 1, '30648110': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6311773-1': 2, '6311773-2': 2, '6311773-3': 2, '6311773-4': 2, '6311773-5': 2, '6311773-6': 2}"}
