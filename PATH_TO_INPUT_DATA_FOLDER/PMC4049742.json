The patient\u2019s hemoglobin level was 7.2 g/dl, platelet count was 13\u00d7109/liter and white blood cell count was 2.44\u00d7109/liter. Bone marrow smears were hypercellular containing 61.5% myeloblasts, 7% promonocytes and 2.5% monoblasts. In addition, the blasts in the bone marrow were positive for peroxidase staining. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed that the blasts were positive for cluster of differentiation (CD)117, CD33 and CD64, weakly positive for CD15, human leukocyte antigen-DR, myeloperoxidase and CD13, and negative for CD22, CD56, cCD3, CD11b, CD14, CD19, CD34 and CD7. The patient had been well prior to the development of these symptoms, had no history of exposure to organic solvents or dye, and had never received irradiation or anticancer agents.\\nThe diagnosis was determined as AML with maturation (French-American-British classification of M2). The patient commenced a standard 7+3 schedule with cytarabine and daunorubicin as an induction therapy. Following the achievement of complete remission (CR), the patient underwent consolidation chemotherapy followed by a medium dose of cytarabine. The patient relapsed following three cycles of medium-dose cytarabine and subsequently received salvage therapy, however, the patient succumbed to a cerebral hemorrhage in March 2013.\\nA bone marrow sample was processed following short-term culture (24 h) according to the standard procedures. The chromosomes were stained by G-banding and the karyotype was determined according to recommendations from the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (2009) ().\\nFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on 200 interphase cells using the Vysis LSI MLL dual color break apart translocation probes (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA).\\nRNA was extracted from the patient\u2019s peripheral blood cells using the Whole Blood RNA isolation kit (BioChain Institute, Inc., Newark, CA, USA). In total, 1\u20132 \u03bcg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the Thermo Scientific Maxima First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). cDNA solution (2 \u03bcl) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to a total volume of 20 \u03bcl with 0.5 \u03bcM of each primer and 10 \u03bcl master mix. The primers used for the first reverse transcription (RT)-PCR were as follows: Sense, TACAGGACCGCCAAGAA for MLL-5S; and antisense, TTGGGCAGCTTCACGAAGTC for SEPT-5A. The nucleotide sequences of the PCR products were determined by a BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Paisley, UK).\\nThe karyotype of the bone marrow cells from the patient was identified as 46,XY,t(11;22)(q23;q11.2)[13]/46,X, \u2212Y,+10,t(11;22)(q23;q11.2)[7]/47,XY,+10,t(11;22)(q23;q11.2)[1]/46,XY[1] in the 22 cells that were examined (). FISH analysis using an MLL-specific probe showed a split in the MLL gene (). This result indicated that the gene was involved in this translocation.\\nTo demonstrate an MLL-septin 5 (SEPT5) fusion transcript in the current t(11;22)-AML patient, RT-PCR analysis was performed using the MLL-5S primer and an antisense primer, SEPT-5A (). Nucleotide sequencing analysis of the PCR product demonstrated the fusion between MLL exon 9 and SEPT5 exon 3, and the product was 521 bp in length ().", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11170279': 1, '16511515': 1, '29326822': 2, '2089178': 1, '19528532': 1, '23725386': 1, '11911106': 1, '8616037': 1, '27374720': 1, '21714766': 1, '9529125': 1, '9600980': 1, '7769837': 1, '19262598': 1, '24932261': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5758965-1': 1}"}
