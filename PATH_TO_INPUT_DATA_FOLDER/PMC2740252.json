Patient was a non smoker and did not consume alcohol. His past medical history was unremarkable. Emergency coronary angiography showed an abnormal vascular image () evoking an atrial mass vascularized and supplied by the circumflex coronary artery.\\nThe other coronary arteries were normal. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a mass attached to the interatrial septum and near the mitral valve ().\\nOperative treatment was performed by cardiopulmonary bypass on 8-11-2001. The interatrial septum and the myxoma were removed from the right atrium, the mitral annulus was affected and the mitral valve was replaced with a 27 mm Carbomedics prosthesis (carbomedics inc. Austin TX). A pericardial patch was used to close the atrial septum defect.\\nA postoperative coronary angiography which was performed on 13-11-2001 showed a normal coronary tree without coronary artery fistula from the circumflex artery and disappearance of the left atrial mass ().\\nThe histological results were compatible with a myxoma.\\nThe patient was symptoms free when last seen in January 2006.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24282745': 1, '10859043': 1, '30804157': 1, '16392241': 1, '10844382': 1, '26175646': 1, '19829855': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
