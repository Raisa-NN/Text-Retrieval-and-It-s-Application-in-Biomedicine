A chest CT scan showed scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules and diffuse lymphadenopathy (Figures , ). A computed tomography-positron emission tomography (CT-PET) scan showed significant uptake in some of the lung nodules and many lymph nodes (Figures -). The patient underwent an uncomplicated left groin lymph node biopsy and was discharged in a stable condition post-procedure. While waiting for his transportation, he had sudden-onset dyspnea and collapsed. After 40 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a non-shockable rhythm, patient achieved return of spontaneous circulation. An echocardiogram during CPR showed right heart strain with questionable inferior vena cava (IVC) clot; hence, tissue plasminogen activator was given for possible massive pulmonary embolism. Patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, but, after another cardiac arrest, his family provided him comfort care and he soon expired. Autopsy showed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma involving both lungs with extensive lympho-vascular invasion and tumor thrombus formation on histologic sections (Figure ). No thrombus was grossly visualized in the bilateral pulmonary arteries and IVC.", "age": "[[74.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'28653784': 1, '8441280': 1, '1847222': 1, '1175142': 1, '12935829': 1, '23037471': 1, '4023795': 1, '23774540': 1, '34912643': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
