On examination, there was an elevated irregular lesion, about 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm in its maximum dimension, on the right dorsolateral portion of the glans penis []. It was bluish-red in color with a smooth surface and irregular margin, compressible, nontender, and nonpulsatile. Color Doppler ultrasonography confirmed the low flow state in the lesion consistent with the diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma. There was no other lesion in the rest of the body. There was no history of trauma of bleeding from the lesion.\\nThe hemangioma was treated by instillation of sodium tetradecyl sulfate 3%. 1 ml of the sclerosant was directly instilled into the lesion with a 26G needle with a tourniquet at the base of the penis to prevent filling. Then compression was applied for about 10 min for emptying the hemangioma. Pressure dressing on the glans penis was applied for 48 h. The procedure was repeated after 1-week. In the 3rd week, patient presented with a scab [] which was removed spontaneously with a resultant ulcer and the lesion disappeared in 6th week.
