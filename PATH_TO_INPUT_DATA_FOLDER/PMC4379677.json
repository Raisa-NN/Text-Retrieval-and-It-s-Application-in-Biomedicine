FDG PET-CT showed intense tracer uptake in the right lower lobe lung lesion along with multiple mediastinal and right supraclavicular lymph nodes []. Furthermore, increased tracer uptake noted in the entire left hemipelvis with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 5.3. CT showed cortical thickening, intra trabeculation with course thick trabeculae, bone expansion, and multiple areas of sclerosis, consistent with Paget's disease []. The level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 456 IU/l. He underwent follow-up FDG PET-CT after three cycles of chemotherapy showed intense FDG uptake with decrease in size and metabolism of the lung primary and mediastinal nodes with complete response in supraclavicular and some mediastinal nodes. But left hemipelvis uptake remains same, and he was asymptomatic for Paget's disease [].", "age": "[[65.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12231408': 1, '17418153': 1, '18580246': 1, '29142349': 1, '31149157': 1, '33088752': 1, '9293817': 1, '21969781': 2, '28721304': 1, '3056466': 1, '3342581': 1, '12235348': 1, '16741296': 1, '23177337': 1, '25829736': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3180723-1': 1}"}
