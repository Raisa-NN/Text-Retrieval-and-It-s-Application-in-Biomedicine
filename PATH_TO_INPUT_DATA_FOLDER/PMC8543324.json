She did not show any symptoms in a thorough neurological examination, and she was remitted from psychiatric symptoms.\\nShe reported 2 episodes of psychotic symptoms in December 2017 and September 2018. In the first episode, she had not sought medical help because symptoms ameliorated soon without medical intervention.\\nIn September 2018, she had flu-like symptoms. Three weeks later, she again heard a voice that told her to commit suicide. She had delusions and disorganized and paranoid thinking. In addition, she reported diffuse visual disturbances, especially double vision, and did not recognize her parents' faces. CT and MRI (Fig. ) displayed 2 subependymal tumors, radial migration lines and cortical tubers, which proves the diagnosis of TSC according to the current guidelines []. An EEG revealed no pathology. Laboratory findings were unremarkable, and ultrasound of the heart and abdominal organs displayed no further TSC-related tumor. An ophthalmologic examination found no correlate for the visual disturbances and especially no retinal hamartomas. A lumbar puncture was recommended, but the patient refused at this time. She was diagnosed with organic delusional disorder and treated with olanzapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole. Symptoms completely resolved, and she remained free of symptoms for more than a year, although she stopped medication only a few days after discharge.\\nIn February 2019, we performed blood sampling and a lumbar puncture and found elevated serum (1:10,000) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) titers (1:3) of IgG anti-NMDAR antibodies but no antibodies against AMPAR1/2, DPPX, GABA-B-receptor, LGI1, or CASPR2. Interestingly, tissue-based immunofluorescence of CSF showed IgG antibodies binding to cerebral blood vessels with an undetermined epitope. There were no other alterations in CSF parameters, for example, no elevated cell count, no oligoclonal bands, no increase in protein, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function was not compromised.\\nAn MRI displayed (again) the 2 subependymal tumors, radial migration lines, and cortical tubers, showing no growth of the subependymal tumors but contrast enhancement in one of them. We therefore confirmed the diagnosis of a TSC according to the recommendations of the 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference []. We screened the patient for TSC-related neuropsychiatric disorders according to the TAND checklist, but there were no findings in either of the 12 dimensions. The patient refused genetic testing of TSC. EEG revealed no pathological findings, and another abdominal ultrasound exhibited no teratoma. We agreed with the patient on an active surveillance strategy with regard to the incidental TSC and \u2212 despite the detection of NMDAR-antibodies \u2212 the previous psychotic symptoms because she was asymptomatic at that time.\\nIn May 2020, the patient was transferred to our hospital because of a stupor. Retrospectively, the patient reported being delusional (megalomania, delusion of reference) for about 1 week before hospital admission and complained about sleep disturbances. She ameliorated under treatment with benzodiazepines within a few hours but remained delusional and showed harmful behavior toward others; therefore, we transferred her to an external psychiatry department, where she was treated intermittently between May and August of 2020. Blood sampling and lumbar puncture showed the same NMDAR antibody titers as in February 2019 (1:3 in CSF and 1:10,000 in serum). Again, CSF revealed neither pleocytosis nor oligoclonal bands. Laboratory results yielded no further pathologic result. Especially, thyroid levels were in a normal range, and urinalysis was negative for drugs (methadone, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates). She was negative for HIV, hepatitis virus B and C, and tuberculosis. Nevertheless, in a neurological inhospital re-evaluation in August 2020, she still complained of disturbed circadian rhythm and noticed difficulty concentrating, so she was not able to manage her daily life alone. Moreover, she felt that sleep disturbances were worsening. As she was symptomatic and fulfilled the criteria for NMDARE (oligosymptomatic-psychiatric) according to the criteria of Graus et al. [], we started a therapy with 2 cycles with rituximab (and premedication with prednisolone). One day after the first treatment with prednisolone and rituximab, her symptoms deteriorated as she became delusional and showed inadequate, agitated behavior as well as signs of thought disorders. We added 1 cycle of intravenous immunoglobulins and reinitiated her antipsychotic and sedative treatment with olanzapine, lorazepam, and zolpidem. Upon discharge about 1 week later, her condition had improved significantly as she was now less delusional and showed an improving organization of thinking. She agreed to continue the antipsychotic treatment as well as further immunotherapy with rituximab. In September 2020, NMDAR antibody titers had declined (1:1 in CSF, 1:100 in serum). After an initial stabilization and overall improvement of her clinical status to the extent that she had taken up her studies again, the patient began suffering from depressive symptoms and anxiety, ultimately resulting in committing suicide in January 2021 during an ongoing inpatient treatment in a psychiatric hospital.
