Four years prior to presentation, an acquaintance of the patient developed pertussis, which prompted the patient to seek immunization. The patient had not been vaccinated against pertussis in childhood. Based on the Center for Disease Control age recommendations, Tdap was administered on her left deltoid; the patient subsequently developed a new lesion over the previous site of the vaccine administration.\\nCutaneous examination revealed a 5 x 5 mm papule on her prior Tdap vaccination site (Figure ). A punch biopsy was performed. Microscopic examination showed ovoid melanocytes in the dermis. Collagen was trapped between the melanocytes and the surrounding fibrous stroma.\\nCorrelation of the clinical history, lesion morphology, and pathology established the diagnosis of a cellular blue nevus developing at the site of the Tdap vaccination. The residual lesion was excised. There has been no recurrence.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'29702631': 1, '19548975': 1, '12706691': 1, '27256351': 1, '25241575': 1, '8470766': 1, '25483496': 1, '26988991': 2, '33282575': 1, '21366456': 1, '31497428': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4906099-1': 1}"}
