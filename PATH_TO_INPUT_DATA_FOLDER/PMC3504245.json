She had neurosurgery 15 years before and since then she had been treated with 4 mg/day of methylprednisolone orally. The lesions appeared progressively over two years, they were asymptomatic, and there was no history of local trauma.\\nHistopathological examination revealed an intense inflammatory process in the dermis, and several septate hyphae and round or oval spore-like structures that stained positively with periodic acid Schiff stain (Figures and ). Cultures of cutaneous biopsies grew Alternaria sp., identified as Alternaria alternata by DNA analysis. Due to the extension of the lesions, surgical excision was not feasible. We started itraconazole (100 mg twice daily) and also reduced the corticosteroids, but no improvement was observed after 8 months of treatment. Treatment with intravenous voriconazole at a dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 hours was initiated, followed by 100 mg orally after day 10, with marked improvement of the lesions (Figures and ). However, 4 months after stopping the voriconazole the patient developed congestive heart failure. Her condition deteriorated over the time, and she subsequently died.", "age": "[[76.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11069544': 1, '17655420': 1, '11283807': 1, '21787876': 1, '18042595': 1, '18583793': 1, '34917472': 1, '10809981': 1, '16854189': 1, '8993964': 1, '18608728': 1, '25370461': 1, '25750855': 1, '10848774': 1, '23198173': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
