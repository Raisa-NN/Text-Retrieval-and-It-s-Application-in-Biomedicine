At that time laboratory studies showed an elevation of white blood cells (WBC 19.290/mm3). Chest x-ray and abdominal, cerebral and cardiac ultrasound were performed and urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples for culture were obtained. All these tests were negative. Therefore a systemic antibiotic therapy was started with ampicillin and gentamicin, and after two days switched to ceftriaxone and teicoplanin. Moreover a low dose of IGIV was given. On arrival in our Institution the patient was still febrile. Physical examination showed skin pallor, conjunctivitis and flushed lips, tachycardia, with normal heart sounds, no murmur, tachypnea; an echocardiography was performed, which resulted normal, as well as Chest X-ray, abdominal and cerebral ultrasound. Lumbar puncture was also performed and blood samples were obtained for complete blood cell count and culture. Laboratory studies showed increased WBC (28.830/mm3), platelets (575000/mm3) and Reactive Protein C (RCP 308 mg/L) and low hemoglobin (7.3 g/dL). The infant underwent red blood cell transfusion and antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin was continued. On the second day ankle edema appeared while fever disappeared; blood examination revealed a significant reduction of RCP (72.4 mg/L) and WBC (21.910/mm3) with platelets persistently increasing (909000/mm3). The child remained well and apyretic for 7 days, then fever recurred, associated with irritability, tachycardia, skin rash on physical examination, and RCP at 239 mg/L (normal range 0 - 5 in our laboratory) and further increase of platelets (1170000/mm3) on laboratory investigations. The scheduled echocardiography was immediately performed and showed mitral valve insufficiency, pericardial effusion and severe anomalies on both coronary arteries: 3 aneurysms from 5 to 6 mm in diameter on the right coronary artery; left main coronary, normal proximally, was progressively dilated distally, as well as the circumflex artery, and there was a tubular aneurysm of 5 mm on the left anterior descending artery. Infusion of IVIG (2 gr/Kg in a single dose in twelve hours) and administration of acetyl salicylic acid (100 mg/Kg in 4 doses) was immediately started along with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Rapid improvement in clinical status, a significant decrease in RCP and platelet values (RCP 139 mg/L, platelets 882000/mmc) with complete normalization 20 days after IVIG infusion was observed. LMWH was then switched to Warfarin. The child was discharged 40 days after admission with acetyl salicylic acid and warfarin therapy, monitored by CoaguCheck System to maintain INR between 2.0 and 2.5. During follow up coronary aneurysms gradually improved. The last cardiac ultrasound showed a 5 mm left coronary artery aneurysm but right coronary artery was not observable. Mitral valve insufficiency and pericardial effusion were no longer present. A Cardiac catheterization was performed to study the coronary arteries which confirmed the presence of a 5 mm left coronary artery aneurysm with thrombus, and showed the interruption of the right coronary artery 18 mm from its origin (Figure ). Currently the child receives acetyl salicylic acid 5 mg/Kg and warfarin 0.28 mg/Kg.", "age": "[[2.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15574639': 1, '7699529': 1, '14534763': 1, '20104198': 1, '16511388': 1, '18478263': 1, '22682313': 1, '15295237': 1, '8822996': 1, '3802442': 1, '12739925': 1, '12102484': 1, '10390296': 1, '27857465': 2, '15107520': 1, '4153258': 1, '11230614': 1, '15805345': 1, '3772656': 1, '2426590': 1, '23406772': 2, '6062087': 1, '21496328': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5036337-1': 1, '3632492-1': 1}"}
