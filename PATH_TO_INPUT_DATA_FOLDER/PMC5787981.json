He also complained of heaviness of ear lobules and restricted neck movement to the left, owing to the painful ulcer on the left swelling. There was a history of boils on both ear lobules. On examination, a giant swelling of size 15 cm \u00d7 8 cm of the left ear lobule and adjacent area and a small swelling of size 5 cm \u00d7 3 cm hanging out from the right ear lobule were noted. Both the swellings were firm in consistency with the irregular bosselated surface, well-defined margins, mobile and not fixed to overlying skin or underlying anatomy.\\nThe clinical diagnosis of keloid was confirmed by fine needle aspiration cytology which showed collagenous fibroma. In consultation with the patient and his family, surgery was planned. Preoperatively, three cycles of perilesional triamcinolone were injected at intervals of 3 weeks. Total excision was done [Figures and ], and tissue was sent for histopathological examination which showed haphazardly arranged broad, homogeneous highly eosinophilic collagen bundles outlined by large pale staining fibroblasts, confirming the diagnosis []. Silicone gel pad and elastic stockings were advised postoperatively. Three doses of perilesional triamcinolone were injected 1 month after the operation and at 3 weeks intervals each.
