Enlarged neck lymph nodes were not detected (). Total thyroxine (TT4) and total triiodothyronine (TT3) were 109.60 nmol/L (55.47\u2013161.25 nmol/L) and 1.16 nmol/L (1.02\u20132.96 nmol/L); free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) were 14.63 pmol/L (10.45\u201324.38 pmol/L) and 4.36 pmol/L (2.77\u20136.31 pmol/L), respectively. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) were 1.58 mIU/L (0.380\u20134.340 mIU/L) and 852.0 IU/mL (0\u2013100 IU/mL), respectively.\\nSeven years earlier, the patient had been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a DDD cardiac pacemaker was implanted. Her cardiac function was graded as New York Heart Association class III. A cardiac ultrasound showed diffuse thickening of the ventricular walls and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 60%. The N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was 1048 pg/mL (0\u2013100 pg/mL).\\nCore needle biopsy (18 G needle) confirmed the diagnosis of PTC (). The patient was considered unable to tolerate a thyroidectomy, so instead RFA was performed. We used Valleylab Cool-Tip\u2122 RFA System (Boulder, CO, USA), including monopolar electrode, radiofrequency generator and cool-tip pump. The nodule was ablated with fixed electrode technique (FET) (). After sterilization and local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine, the ablation electrode was inserted into the nodule under ultrasound guidance. The ablation was started with 5 W and increased to 28 W gradually in a 1 cm active tip. It was terminated when the RFA-induced transient hyperechoic zone covered the entire carcinoma and the needle passage was also ablated when the ablation electrode was retracted. It took 7 minutes to complete the ablation. The patient was well informed before RFA was performed.\\nRegular follow-up neck ultrasound showed no signs of recurrence or metastases after 1, 3, 15, and 41 months; and the patient had no complications of RFA (). During the follow-up, the size of ablated lesion was reduced and the echogenicity was decreased; in addition, the TT4 and TT3 were 73.20 nmol/L (55.47\u2013161.25 nmol/L) and 0.94 nmol/L (1.02\u20132.96 nmol/L), respectively; FT4 and FT3 were 14.02 pmol/L (10.45\u201324.38 pmol/L) and 3.76 pmol/L (2.77\u20136.31 pmol/L), respectively. TSH and TPO-Ab were 0.97 mIU/L (0.380\u20134.340 mIU/L) and 670.70 IU/mL (0\u2013100 IU/mL); respectively.\\nThis case report was approved by the Institutional Review Board.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12616125': 1, '24476936': 1, '20497938': 1, '25045352': 1, '23133449': 1, '27833413': 1, '11886323': 1, '28670156': 1, '9874472': 1, '25469097': 1, '21103289': 1, '21081783': 1, '20308523': 1, '28246522': 1, '29947175': 1, '30390667': 1, '16728537': 1, '25469095': 1, '27390548': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
