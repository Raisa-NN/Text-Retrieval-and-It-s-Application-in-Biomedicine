History taking revealed no particular issues other than being occasionally alcoholic. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a submucosal vascular lesion measuring 2.3 \u00d7 2.3 cm in the second part of the duodenum. Vascular component of the lesion was better appreciated on endoscopic ultrasound color Doppler (). No lesions were identified in the esophagus or stomach. Exploratory laparotomy with duodenotomy and local lesion excision was planned. The lesion was excised with no intraoperative complications.\\nHistologically, the tumor was identified in the submucosa and was composed of epithelioid cell nests, areas of spindle cells, and scattered ganglion cells. A positive cellular reaction for synaptophysin and S-100 was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The tumor was revealed to be a gangliocytic paraganglioma, an unusual lesion. Patient is on regular followup and is symptomatically better with no fresh complaints (Figures , , , , and ).", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'28458307': 1, '1519587': 1, '641198': 1, '30565068': 1, '26328037': 1, '27810610': 1, '6972163': 1, '15065006': 1, '20497533': 2, '13458330': 1, '22340577': 1, '4099700': 1, '24073351': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2887868-1': 1}"}
