Clinically, the lesion was well circumscribed, white, and 1 cm diameter with a rough papilliferous surface. It was provisionally diagnosed as papilloma and excision of the lesion was done under local anesthesia. Grossly, the lesion was 0.8 cm with a rough verrucous surface.\\nHistopathologically, the lesion showed exoendophytic proliferation of ductal epithelium with numerous papillary projections lined by a parakeratotic, acanthotic stratified squamous epithelium (). The papillary epithelium showed dysplastic features such as basal cell hyperplasia, nuclear and cellular pleomorphism, nuclear hyperchromatism, and 3 to 4 mitotic figures per high power field (Figures and ). The papillae showed thin fibro-vascular cores with mild mixed inflammatory infiltrate. At the junction with normal mucosa, the epithelium showed wide, rounded rete pegs pushing into the connective tissue. Below the papillary proliferations, the connective tissue showed mucous salivary gland with extralobular dilated tortuous ducts lined by luminal columnar cells and abluminal cuboidal cells (Figures and ). Based on these features, it was diagnosed as sialadenoma papilliferum. Since the lesion was adequately, excised no additional therapy was given and the patient is on regular follow-up for the past one year without any recurrence.", "age": "[[65.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15308267': 1, '271294': 1, '33712056': 1, '31636877': 1, '1700116': 1, '6938655': 1, '11458248': 1, '3754726': 1, '17630095': 1, '5353939': 1, '15455228': 1, '22567454': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
