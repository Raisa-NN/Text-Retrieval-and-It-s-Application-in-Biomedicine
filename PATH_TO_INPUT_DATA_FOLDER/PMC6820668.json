Unlike her prior dislocations, she was unable to reduce it herself. She was unable to provide further details about her prior elbow injuries.\\nPhysical exam revealed deformity to the left elbow with a decreased range of motion. Radial pulse was 2+ and sensation was intact distally. There was no swelling, radial head tenderness, erythema, or warmth present. Radiograph of the elbow demonstrated a dislocation of the radial head and a subluxed elbow joint without obvious fracture (Figure ).\\nEtomidate was used for sedation in small aliquots, to a total of 10 mg, for procedural sedation. The joint was reduced by hyperpronation followed by supination with flexion while applying pressure on the radial head. She tolerated the procedure well and without complication. Pain and range of motion improved post-reduction. Post-reduction films showed a suspected hemarthrosis in addition to the resolution of the dislocation and subluxation (Figure ). She was placed in a sling with swathe and was discharged with intact neurovascular function with orthopedic follow-up.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27836316': 1, '13224252': 1, '15686243': 1, '2266453': 1, '16487784': 1, '29157249': 1, '8537850': 1, '1303419': 1, '7574131': 1, '7105537': 1, '27687166': 1, '25722812': 2, '17603874': 2, '27299027': 2, '30881546': 1, '2393168': 1, '21063576': 1, '31695989': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4341054-1': 1, '1914083-1': 1, '4719361-1': 1}"}
