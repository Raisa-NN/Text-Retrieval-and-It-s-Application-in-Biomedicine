She had nothing special to report in her medical history. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities, and laboratory data were within normal limits.\\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) demonstrated a polypoid mass at 36 cm distance from the incisor in the esophagus. After spray of Lugol solution, EGD showed a 1.3-cm Lugol-voided polyp at 36 cm distance from the upper incisor. Additionally, a Lugol-voided flat lesion at 30\u201336 cm distance from the upper incisor and a Lugol-voided flat lesion at 27\u201329 cm distance from the upper incisor were noted (Fig. ). The result of the biopsy suggested that it was a BSCC.\\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest demonstrated neither an esophageal mass nor mediastinal/hilar lymph node enlargement. PET-CT showed no evidence of distant metastasis.\\nThe patient underwent esophagectomy with a gastric pull-up reconstruction and cervical anastomosis through laparotomy and right thoracotomy through the 6th intercostal space. A gross examination of the resected specimen showed a polypoid mass (1.3 \u00d7 1 cm) presenting in the distal esophagus, 2 cm from the gastroesophageal junction and 7 cm from the proximal resection margin (Fig. ). The cut surface of the polypoid mass was white, firm, and granular. Microscopically, the polypoid mass consisted of basaloid cells with oval to round nuclei, open pale chromatin, and scant basophilic cytoplasm (Fig. ). Occasionally, it showed a comedo-like necrosis structure (Fig. ). The tumor permanent pathology examination revealed BSCC. In addition, another BSCC was noted 0.4 cm apart from the polypoid mass. It extended to the lamina propria. Multiple separated dysplastic areas were noted. The excised 8 regional lymph nodes did not harbor tumor cells, and the proximal and distal resected margin presented no tumor.\\nThe patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Because cancer stage was I, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were not necessary. Regular periodic follow-up showed no evidence of recurrence or metastasis in the 5-month postoperative period.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'6301250': 1, '9149011': 1, '7829398': 1, '3770734': 1, '1260673': 1, '24229040': 1, '18847449': 1, '1384369': 1, '2731126': 1, '8491589': 1, '14641302': 1, '2364364': 1, '2439435': 1, '29033778': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
