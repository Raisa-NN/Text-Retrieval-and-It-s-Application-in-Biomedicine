His ABP was 115/68 mmHg, pulse rate was 80 beats/minute, O2 saturation was 98%, body temperature was 36,7\u00b0C, and he was disoriented with a GCS score of 13. Other physical examination findings were normal, and laboratory results were unremarkable. His ECG revealed accelerated junctional rhythm at a rate of 70 bpm concomitant with bigeminy ventricular extrasystoles (VES). We thought bonzai might be responsible from the abnormalities in ECG, and the patient was treated with 1.5 mL/kg bolus of 20% lipid intravenously, followed by an infusion of a 0.25 mL/kg/minute for 60 minutes (total dose of 990 mL). On the fifth minute of ILE infusion, it was observed that the frequency of VES decreased, and after finishing the ILE infusion (at 60th minute of treatment), the patient's rhythm was sinus at a rate of 74 beats/minute with no VES (). His GCS also improved to 15 four hours after ILE infusion. He was discharged in good health after 24 hours of observation without any complications.", "age": "[[17.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21489160': 1, '24496123': 1, '23910858': 1, '9579517': 1, '26788376': 2, '33967865': 1, '23459217': 1, '17448066': 1, '24905374': 1, '20095812': 1, '20956228': 1, '11157422': 1, '19593708': 1, '20923546': 1, '24974371': 1, '24338451': 1, '31673444': 1, '22989695': 1, '24661585': 1, '22575211': 1, '20605670': 1, '24921061': 1, '23890611': 1, '26078891': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4442263-1': 2, '4442263-2': 2, '4442263-3': 2, '4691597-1': 1}"}
