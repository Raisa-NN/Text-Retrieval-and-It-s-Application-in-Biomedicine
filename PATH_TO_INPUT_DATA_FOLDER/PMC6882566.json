Two and half months later, multiple severe painful and itchy discrete erythematous to purpuric papules, pustules, and crusted ulcers on her chest, abdomen, pubic area, back, and 4 limbs were noted. The skin biopsy revealed parakeratosis, basal cell vacuolization, perivascular lymphocytic, and neutrophilic infiltration, with erythrocyte extravasation into the superficial dermis and gram-positive cocci in small clusters that were compatible with the culture result. Amyloid deposition was noted at the papillary dermis. The periodic acid-Schiff stain showed negative results for fungus. Her platelet count and coagulation profiles were within normal limits, and the pus culture yielded OSSA. She received treatment with systemic cefazolin and topical petrolatum without discontinuation of erlotinib treatment. The skin eruption subsided after 6 days of treatment.", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16990857': 1, '16908348': 1, '6092481': 1, '17010747': 1, '23314653': 1, '11422037': 1, '24831548': 1, '28538945': 1, '18283195': 1, '16012181': 1, '23602600': 1, '29507555': 1, '20007525': 1, '11062541': 1, '11060328': 1, '31764850': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6882566-1': 2, '6882566-2': 2}"}
