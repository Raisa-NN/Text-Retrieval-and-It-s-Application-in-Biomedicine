Soon after hospitalization, he was submitted to orotracheal intubation and placed in the prone position to improve hypoxia, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). On the third day of hospitalization, he developed oliguria, azotemia, and volume overload. The nephrology service was activated to obtain deep venous access for RRT. The patient could not be placed in the supine position due to significant hypoxemia. A long-term dialysis catheter was inserted through the left popliteal vein. He underwent conventional intermittent hemodialysis daily for 8 days. The blood flow during the sessions remained between 300 - 400 mL/min. Due to the severity of the clinical scenario, the patient ended up dying as a consequence of respiratory failure on the 11th day. This case report describes a challenging situation in obtaining vascular access when dealing with patients with COVID-19 in the prone position.", "age": "[[73.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'32322766': 1, '32109012': 1, '32204907': 1, '32236644': 1, '33599679': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
