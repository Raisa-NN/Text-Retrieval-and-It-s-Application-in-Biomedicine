However, he lost consciousness again in the ambulance. His ECG monitor displayed ventricular fibrillation (VF), and then, he was resuscitated by an automated external defibrillator. His 12-lead ECG recorded at the emergency room showed coved-type ST elevations in V1 and V2 leads (Figure ); thus, he was diagnosed with BrS. Echocardiography revealed that he had no structural heart disease. His 36-year-old elder sister had experienced 9 episodes of syncope since 12 years old, and had been misdiagnosed with epilepsy or vasovagal syncope. However, since her younger brother (the proband) was diagnosed with BrS, she was examined by cardiologists. Her 12-lead ECG showed coved-type ST elevations in V1 and V2 leads (Figure ); thus, she was diagnosed with BrS. Both siblings were implanted with implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator.", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31357904': 1, '25925977': 1, '22529811': 2, '30593458': 1, '26031372': 1, '30190309': 1, '20339117': 1, '12123767': 1, '32437023': 1, '11265734': 1, '16632547': 1, '14871545': 1, '30935997': 1, '25261036': 1, '17198989': 1, '12130650': 1, '20129283': 1, '31866066': 1, '1309182': 1, '15023552': 1, '21840964': 1, '21321465': 1, '29983085': 1, '33920294': 1, '33463855': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3330751-1': 1, '3330751-2': 1}"}
