There was no history of fever, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite, fatigue, or head and neck cancer. He has been a heavy smoker (2 packs per day) for 40 years. He is a type-II diabetic, but using insulin and has history of cervical tuberculous lymphadenopathy 20 years ago, treated with triple medication for 9 months. Examination showed that he has a moderate stridor. Neck examination showed bilateral neck mass, mobile, non-tender, and soft, not attached to skin, or underlying tissue. His plain soft tissue neck x-ray and CT scan confirmed bilateral laryngoceles (). He underwent elective tracheostomy under local anesthesia followed by laryngeal multiple biopsies from the swollen mucosa; although not clinically suspicious, to rule out underlying hidden malignancy. Surgical excision of bilateral combined laryngoceles was carried out with an external approach with trans thyrohyoid membrane approach, combined with V-shaped thyrotomy to improve exposure (). No malignancy was identified in the final pathology.", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21225787': 1, '21424053': 1, '19410402': 1, '18392516': 1, '24729979': 1, '22500070': 1, '23120570': 1, '17275541': 1, '19288148': 1, '27464869': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
