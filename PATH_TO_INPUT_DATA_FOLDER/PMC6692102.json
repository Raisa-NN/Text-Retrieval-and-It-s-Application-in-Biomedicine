He has an extensive past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type two diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, arthritis, and gout, now burdened with several unexpected conditions of the breast. He proceeded to have a diagnostic mammogram upon his original presentation, which demonstrated an oval mass with round calcifications measuring 15 mm in the right subareolar region. These suspicious findings prompted a right breast ultrasound in conjunction with core biopsies. These studies resulted in his diagnosis of infiltrative ductal carcinoma in situ of the right breast, with a Bloom-Richardson grade two out of three, with perineural invasion. With these findings, the decision was made to undergo a mastectomy.\\nEleven years later, the patient returned with concern for another mass, this time in his left subareolar region. Subsequent mammogram, ultrasound and core needle biopsies were utilized to assess for recurrence of his infiltrative ductal carcinoma in situ. This workup resulted in a very distinct pathology, PASH (Figure ).", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18084246': 1, '7872425': 1, '29316031': 1, '7544764': 1, '1989462': 1, '3949338': 1, '9659260': 1, '17858550': 1, '26101734': 2, '13571385': 1, '19653734': 1, '22583194': 1, '18647902': 1, '20858836': 1, '31423399': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4472651-1': 1}"}
