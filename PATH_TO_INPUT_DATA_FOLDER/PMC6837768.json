Blood tests demonstrated acute renal failure (creatinine 168 \u00b5mol/L, lactate 22 mmol/L, calcium 2.84 and phosphate 3.1 mmol/L).\\nA new HIV-1 diagnosis was made (CD4 lymphocyte count 3 cells/\u00b5L, viral load 912 376 copies/mL). Epstein-Barr viral titres were 21 620 500 copies/mL.\\nComputed tomography (CT) suggested Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma with disease affecting the lungs, heart (), sternum, liver, vertebrae and kidneys with bilateral renal vein tumour thrombi. Biopsy of the sternal mass demonstrated diffuse lymphoid infiltrates of skeletal muscle in a starry sky pattern, in keeping with Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma.\\nThe patient was commenced on antiretroviral therapy including Descovy and Dolutegravir, with a Rituximab-CODOX-M/IVAC chemotherapy regimen.\\nHis initial management was complicated by tumour lysis syndrome, pseudomonas bacteraemia and cytomegalovirus infection of the gastrointestinal tract, all successfully treated.\\nSubsequent CT imaging revealed an excellent treatment response, regression of extensive hepatic and renal infiltration and resolution of bilateral renal vein tumour thrombi, allowing anticoagulation to be discontinued.", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24359983': 1, '8018141': 1, '22333947': 1, '25730506': 1, '23575094': 1, '21711523': 2, '16284057': 1, '19074108': 1, '31754479': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3152915-1': 1}"}
