The index pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated. Her past history was uneventful, and the results of antenatal laboratory tests were normal. A fetal heart rate was about 150 beats per minute. Fluctuations in the fetal heart rate are called variability were normal without distress sign. A transabdominal ultrasonography with 3.5-5 MHz transducer (Voluson 730 pro, GE, Seoul, Korea) revealed a single, live fetus with measurements corresponding to the gestational age except abdominal circumference, due to hepatosplenomegaly. Findings of fetal hydrops also were not observed. A total amniotic fluid index measured 17.5 cm which is normal range. Hepatomegaly means that the liver reaches into the fetal pelvis adjacent to the fetal bladder. Length of liver in this period is normally varies from 40 to 60 mm. It can be measured from the dome of the diaphragm to the tip of the right lobe parallel to the long axis of the fetal trunk []. Splenomegaly is diagnosed by three findings. First, the stomach is displaced anteriorly and to the midline by the enlarged spleen. Second, the spleen is very close to the anterior abdominal wall. Third, color Doppler imaging depicts multiple ramifications of the splenic artery and vein. Length of spleen in this period is normally measured from 45 to 60 mm []. Echogenecity of both organs is usually isoechogenic. However, in this case, size of liver and spleen were above 95th percentile of the upper limit and also the shows both organs adjacent to bladder, which indicates fetal hepatosplenomegaly. Although limited clinical information was available to discuss the ideal mode of delivery with the parents, we recommended cesarean delivery next day to prompt evaluation of rapid progression of fetal hepatosplenomegaly. At delivery, the newborn, a male, weighted 3,070 g was born and Apgar scores were 5 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. When the newborn was physically examined, it revealed unstable respiration with tachypnea and desaturation due to abdominal distension. Intubation was immediately performed and the baby was mechanically ventilated in the neonatal intensive care unit. The abdomen was moderately distended and liver and spleen were palpable 4 and 2 cm below the costal margins. No skin lesions were present (e.g., twenty five to thirty percent of infants with CL have specific cutaneous infiltrates; leukemia cutis which usually appear as firm blue or red nodules called Blueberry Muffin) [].\\nOn laboratory tests performed at birth, the hemoglobin concentration was 13.3 g/dL, hematocrit was 42.9%, platelet cells count was 228\u00d7103/UL, and white blood cells count was 28.18\u00d7103/UL. A differential cell count revealed 25% neutrophils, 44% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 3% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 1% myelocytes, and 23% atypical lymphocyte. Few atypical cells were observed on peripheral blood smear and initial peripheral blood chromosome study reveals normal karyotype. Also, serology studies for TORCH syndrome, including serum antibody titers against toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, rubella, and herpes simplex virus and venereal disease research laboratory tests were all negative ruling out infectious condition. Another work-up for septic condition and tandem mass for metabolic disorder were all negative. While further evaluation and monitoring were performed, aspects of hepatic failure were consistently shown with elevated total bilirubin (7.38 mg/dL) in spite of exchanged transfusion for prevention of kernicterus. On peripheral blood test performed on 28 days after birth, the hemoglobin concentration was 10.7 g/dL, hematocrit was 33.4%, platelet cells count was 123\u00d7103/UL, and white blood cells count was 67.94\u00d7103/UL. A differential cell count revealed 20% neutrophils, 6% lymphocytes, 22% monocytes, 19% eosinophils, 3% basophils, 0% myelocytes, and 30% atypical lymphocyte. Increased numbers of atypical cells which are large-sized immature blasts were seen in a peripheral blood smear (), therefore bone marrow aspiration was performed. A bone marrow aspirate smear showed a moderately cellular marrow with abnormal proliferation of immature blasts (\u226535%) and granulocytic precursors and negative for myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B and periodic acid Schiff stain. The erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes were decreased in number (). Immunophenotyping revealed that the 75% of blasts were positive for myeloid leukemic marker of CD33+. The final diagnosis was acute myeloid leukemia. Work-up for detecting metastasis of leukemic cell was done, and there were no specific finding except small ventricular septal defect in computed tomography angiography.\\nTo figure out the cause of CL, especially for recurrent genetic abnormalities in de novo AML, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for core-binding factor subunit beta, myeloid lymphoid lineage, AML1/ETO gene rearrangement were done. Although recurrent genetic abnormalities were not detected, 94% of three AML1 gene signals which could be interpreted as trisomy 21 were detected in this bone marrow specimen. The AML1 (CBFA2) gene, located in the chromosomal band 21q22, has recently attracted a lot of interest in terms of its role in leukemogenesis []. Retrospectively, to investigate the three AML1 signals on initial peripheral blood specimen shown normal karyotype, we performed the FISH, AML1/ETO gene rearrangement. FISH results showed 50% three AML1 signals on initial peripheral blood specimen. Based on the presence of three AML1 signals with normal karyotype in initial study, this patient was thought to have a clonal change of cryptic three AML1 gene signals carrying normal karyotype, and in other words, this result can confirm the presence of CL with AML1 gene duplication. Three AML1 clonal progressions were noted in bone marrow specimen (). Therefore, this patient had very low possibility of Down syndrome except the case of very low level of mosaic Down syndrome.\\nEven though the infant was treated with chemotherapy (idarubicin, cytarabine, etoposide, and daunorubicin), ventilator care and inotropic agents, the baby developed increasing respiratory distress and hypotension. He died of respiratory distress with pneumonia at 6 weeks after birth.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'3900834': 1, '22510298': 1, '420185': 1, '12646943': 1, '10864057': 1, '3935811': 1, '10475541': 1, '12759620': 1, '1303413': 1, '20548861': 1, '12028017': 1, '25105108': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
