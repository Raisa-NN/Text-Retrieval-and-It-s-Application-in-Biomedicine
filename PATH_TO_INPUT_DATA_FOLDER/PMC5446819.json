The patient\u2019s medication list includes dabigatran, lisinopril, and metoprolol. The ICD shock was aborted upon ceasing the chiropractic manipulation. Upon arrival to the emergency department, her blood pressure was 146/98, heart rate 106, respiratory rate 19, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient\u2019s dual-chamber ICD with Durata, Biphasic waveform defibrillator leads was interrogated in the emergency room, which revealed that it was in DDDR mode with an A lead impedance of 460 Ohms, and a V lead impedance of 430 Ohms. The max track rate was set at 130 and paced AV delay was at 150. Detection criteria were 153 beats per minute (bpm) for VT-1 (monitor only), 200 bpm for VT-2, and 240 bpm for VF (ATP 3\u00d7, 550 V, 845 V, 890 V 2\u00d7 for both VT-2 and VF). It further showed intermittent low-amplitude sinusoidal wave interference or noise from the chiropractic muscle stimulation, which resulted in false sensing by the ICD (Fig. ), which eventually lead to a shock (Fig. ). The patient converted to sinus rhythm after the shock (Fig. ). Physical exam was unremarkable and EKG revealed a paced rhythm with pre-atrial contractions. The patient\u2019s hospital course was uneventful; she had two sets of negative troponin I, and eventually discharged home with the advice to avoid TENS therapy.\\nIn chiropractic therapy, low-output TENS is transmitted to relieve pain and/or spasm of the particular muscle or muscle group. Common side effects experienced by the patient in this setting include pins-and-needles sensation, muscle twitching, or even full muscle contraction, which may last up to 30 min. To differentiate between skeletal muscle over-sensing (pectoral myopotentials) versus inappropriate discharge relating to electromagnetic interference (EMI), a thorough analysis of the lead strips was performed. We believe external electromagnetic interference is the cause in our case as there is a patient history consistent with an encounter with an EMI source (TENS). In addition, there is noise seen in all sensing channels (Fig. ), a finding consistent with EMI. In Fig. , once the EMI had resolved and there was discontinuation of TENS, noise is absent. On the other hand, skeletal muscle over-sensing (pectoral myopotentials) usually only occurs when there is provocative skeletal isometric exercise involving the upper extremities/abdominal muscles, a scenario not surrounding our patient.", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23131066': 1, '22010117': 1, '21272746': 1, '18387436': 1, '29225838': 2, '23770170': 1, '19411677': 1, '24581928': 1, '16916859': 1, '28258389': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5715425-1': 1}"}
