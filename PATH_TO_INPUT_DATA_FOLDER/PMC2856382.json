The lesion had been present for the past four years and had been biopsied twice. Histological investigations revealed a benign leukoplakia of the tongue without dysplasia. Treatment was done with topical corticosteroids but failed to induce complete remission. The patient had no other systemic medications.\\nThe patient was subsequently referred to our outpatient department for further advice. Examination of the oral cavity revealed an ulceration of the left undersurface of the tongue [] and showed close contact with an ill-fitting prosthesis of the mandibular molars []. There was no clinical sign of any neuropathy and the patient was advised not to use the prosthetics for two weeks and to come back to the department at the end of this period. Complete healing was observed at that time [] and a relapse of the ulcer was noted after another week of use of the prosthesis.\\nA diagnosis of a chronic traumatic RFD-like tongue ulcer was confirmed and the patient was referred to her dentists to improve the fitting of her prosthesis.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18417376': 1, '12738949': 1, '15617968': 1, '14628895': 1, '19187299': 1, '15503940': 1, '12694439': 1, '17641134': 1, '26421196': 2, '15122122': 1, '18853716': 1, '17701430': 1, '12928531': 1, '18410573': 1, '17217218': 1, '16681241': 1, '15697163': 1, '12196759': 1, '18155606': 1, '17956486': 1, '16961520': 1, '17202819': 1, '20418986': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4569785-1': 1}"}
