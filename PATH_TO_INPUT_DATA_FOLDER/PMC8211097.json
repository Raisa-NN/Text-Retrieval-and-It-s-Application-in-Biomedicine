The RPM reported a 24% increase in the patient\u2019s respiratory rate; the patient was reached by telephone the next day and reported mild allergy-type symptoms. He opted for over-the-counter symptomatic treatment and also declined a clinic visit, as he had been seen in a clinic only 8 days prior. His respiratory symptoms remained mild 7 days after the initial notification; however, he was hospitalized for an unrelated reason. As part of hospital routine during the viral pandemic, he was tested and found to be positive for COVID-19 (see ). The patient\u2019s physiology returned to baseline 14 days after infection onset.", "age": "[[80.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'33208926': 1, '33315057': 1, '26577842': 1, '32915166': 1, '33478810': 1, '14990395': 1, '33299095': 1, '33501372': 1, '32574240': 1, '33027349': 1, '32960881': 1, '32551807': 1, '34086588': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8211097-1': 2, '8211097-2': 2}"}
