No bacteria were observed in CSF upon culture. The peritoneal end was surgically excised and the end was ligated. The patient was administered anti-inflammatory treatment for the following 10 d (ceftriaxone sodium, 2 g/time, Q12h; vancomycin 0.5 g/time, Q8h). On April 3, the CSF was re-examined, which showed that the number of cells was 8 \u00d7 106 cells/L, glucose was 2.69 mmol/L, chloride was 125 mmol/L, and total protein was 341 mg/L.\\nX-ray examination before operation revealed that the peritoneal end of the shunt tube had moved to the pleural cavity, resulting in pulmonary inflammation (Figure ).
