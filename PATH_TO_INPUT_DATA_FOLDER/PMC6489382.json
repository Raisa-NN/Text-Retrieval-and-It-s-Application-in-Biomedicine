Upon examination, he was found to have wound dehiscence and sternal abscess. Patient had undergone a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure 3 months back for his CAD. He underwent sternal debridement and removal of one sternal wire 1 month after the CABG. He endorsed minimal drainage from the sternal wound site. No associated fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath were noted. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed persistent gas at the median sternotomy site with osseous destruction likely secondary to chronic osteomyelitis with abscess []. Post debridement, specimen was initially identified as a Corynebacterium; the patient received broad coverage with IV vancomycin and meropenem. The sternal abscess was drained by surgery and deep tissue cultures were sent for special microbiological testing.", "age": "[[74.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10905972': 1, '27015823': 1, '24655159': 1, '15184112': 1, '14760540': 1, '19832703': 1, '15956447': 1, '16825404': 1, '4109926': 1, '9003600': 1, '24679572': 1, '15203738': 1, '16166681': 1, '17638199': 1, '23587704': 1, '15010171': 1, '17082398': 1, '34120601': 2, '25428146': 1, '21270217': 1, '15883719': 1, '19109476': 1, '28348789': 2, '25024874': 2, '23143362': 1, '22751545': 1, '16672437': 1, '1984175': 1, '30971609': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4091373-1': 1, '5343147-1': 1, '8201711-1': 1}"}
