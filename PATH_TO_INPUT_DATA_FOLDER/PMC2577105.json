Diagnostic tests and therapeutic trials failed to confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, with retinal biopsy done to rule out retinoblastoma (fig. ) showing necrotizing granulomatous disease of unknown etiology (negative stains for mycobacteria). Her 7-month brother and 4-year-old male cousin presented with nystagmus, poor vision, paravascular pigmentary changes (fig. ) and were diagnosed as recessive retinal dystrophy as the parents were first-degree cousins. The girl died at age 2 from tuberculous meningitis and the boys had recurrent tuberculous and Aspergillus infections.", "age": "[[1.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'24292697': 1, '10356152': 1, '12824837': 1, '16547340': 1, '33629196': 1, '3231919': 1, '11138621': 1, '23636897': 1, '18939980': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
