Eight months before he was admitted to our clinic, a subcutaneous tissue mass was excised with a marginal excision from his right thigh; it was liposarcoma. He then received chemotherapy and radiotherapy with a good response but the liposarcoma had since progressed. He was admitted to our hospital, presenting with back pain with radiation and with no neurological deficits. He had a 3-month history of increased back pain, and he did not recall any trauma. A skeletal survey showed no lytic lesions, and a CT scan also showed no evidence of tumors in his spine. A spinal MRI revealed multilevel vertebral body edema (a low signal was seen within the body of his lumbar and thoracic vertebrae, on T1 corresponding to high signal on T2, in keeping with an interosseous metastasis; Fig. ). A CT scan of his chest showed lung metastasis. There was no cord compression. After he and his family gave us written informed consent, Rf-TA and VAP were performed.\\nUnder spinal anesthesia in a prone position, this procedure was also performed with bi-plane fluoroscopy through a transpedicular approach by placement of working cannulas unilaterally. Through the working cannula, a drill and curette were used to create a tract and a cavity at the center of L2 to L4 vertebral bodies. The procedure was performed under fluoroscopic guidance and Rf-TA (50 to 80 \u00b0C, 10 minutes; Fig. ) was made. We then injected high viscosity bone cement at low pressure into the ablated tumor bed. The bone cement injection was monitored with continuous fluoroscopy. When leakage was noted, the application was stopped (Fig. ). In total, 4 ml cement had been released. Postoperative serum chemistries, arterial blood gas, and cardiac enzymes were normal and his postoperative course was uneventful. Cement leakage was observed in the perivertebral soft tissue, perivertebral venous system, and segmental vein.\\nAlthough our patient remained asymptomatic, he had X-rays and CT scans prior to discharge on postoperative day 7. A repeat CT scan showed the characteristic appearance of cement leakage at the level of augmented vertebrae in the perivertebral venous system, segmental vein, epidural space, and soft tissue (Fig. ). A follow-up CT scan showed no further migration of any cement material.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12173385': 1, '23738182': 2, '17724681': 1, '15476088': 1, '20369068': 1, '18566009': 1, '15856808': 1, '16924218': 1, '19575243': 1, '20442991': 1, '15510600': 1, '20528649': 1, '26911878': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3662203-1': 1}"}
