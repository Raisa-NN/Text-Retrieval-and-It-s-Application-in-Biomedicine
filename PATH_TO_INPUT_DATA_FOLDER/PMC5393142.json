On examination, the left elbow was mildly swollen and tender without signs of neurological injury. The radiograph showed fracture of the left humerus supracondyle (Gartland III). On the diagnosis of displaced closed supracondylar fracture, we performed CMR and percutaneous pinning. The mini-open approach was used to place the medial wire (). Immediate postoperatively, the patient developed signs of Ulnar Nerve palsy: mild claw hand with inability to flex the DIPJ of the little finger and reduced sensation over the Ulnar Nerve distribution. On suspicion of an iatrogenic Ulnar Nerve injury, we explored the nerve and found the medial wire impinging on the nerve () and after removal of the medial K-wire we noted an intra-neural blackish segment that could be intra-neural ischaemia or intra-neural hematoma (). A new medial wire was then inserted at a safe distance from the nerve.", "age": "[[10.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23999511': 1, '20357592': 1, '18061186': 1, '23222035': 1, '12667778': 1, '28611917': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5393142-1': 2, '5393142-2': 2}"}
