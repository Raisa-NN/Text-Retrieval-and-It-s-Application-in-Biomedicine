His medical background was remarkable for a medulloblastoma treated with a suboccipital craniotomy and tumour resection with adjuvant radiotherapy at the age of seven. The patient had no postoperative complications or evidence of tumour recurrence on long-term followup. Examination revealed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss on tuning fork testing with normal otoscopic findings. Dysdiadochokinesia, past pointing, and intention tremor were also noted affecting the patient's left upper limb. Audiometry showed bilateral down-sloping moderate-severe sensorineural hearing loss, which was slightly worse on the left side. No prior audiometry was available for comparison.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17420310': 1, '8239558': 1, '7655881': 1, '14501449': 1, '8910872': 1, '19398385': 1, '9921865': 1, '23762708': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
