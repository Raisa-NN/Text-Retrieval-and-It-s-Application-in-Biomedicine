The patient had no previous significant medical conditions and had been travelling in Spain when the painful syndrome began. He first attended a Spanish hospital but x-rays and biological findings were negative. When he returned from Spain, paresthesia and paresis involving the two upper limbs developed and he was admitted to the nearest emergency department. Clinical examination revealed bilateral paresis of the upper limbs with bilateral scapula alata, areflexia of both upper limbs, and hypoesthesia in the right circumflex nerve territory and in the left radial nerve territory. Biological findings only revealed moderate hepatic cytolysis. CT of the cervical spine did not demonstrate any pathological findings. Electroneuromyography showed evidence of bilateral peripheral motor nerve involvement with sensory axonal loss in the territories of the lateral ante-brachial cutaneous nerve. The diagnosis of Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS) was made. Aetiological assessment revealed positive hepatitis E antibodies. Treatment with intravenous corticoids was administered. The patient underwent rehabilitation and gradually recovered over a few months.", "age": "[[33.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22751163': 1, '26209399': 1, '24787332': 1, '27861224': 1, '27095100': 1, '27263426': 1, '26662794': 1, '21886536': 1, '28044362': 1, '34025066': 1, '31508389': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
