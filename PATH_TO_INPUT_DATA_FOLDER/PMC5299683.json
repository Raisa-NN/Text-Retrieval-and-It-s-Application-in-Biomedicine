Physical examination showed an axillary temperature of 38.2 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 110/75 mmHg and an undifferentiated skin rash. Neither skin nor mucosal haemorrhages nor oedema were present. Table shows the results of all laboratory tests. A full blood count and clinical chemistry measurements showed leukocytosis [white blood count (WBC) = 15.7 \u00d7 103 cell/mm3], lymphocytosis [Lymphocytes (Ly) = 6.9 \u00d7 103 cell/mm3], severe thrombocytopenia [Platelets (PLT) = 33 \u00d7 103 cell/mm3), anaemia [Haemoglobin (Hgb) = 9.8 gr/dL] and an elevated level of Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT = 245 U/L). Blood levels of glucose and urea were slightly elevated. The laboratory did not have the capacity to perform a blood culture. Despite treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics, the patient\u2019s condition progressively worsened over the following 2 days, with a continuing high fever and the development of headache, dizziness, symmetrical polyarthralgia and melaena. On day two after admission the Hgb had dropped to 6.2 g/dL and the platelet count had increased slightly to 56 \u00d7 103 cell/mm3. On day three the patient worsened and he was admitted to the intensive care unit where he received 3 units of whole blood. Deterioration continued on day four and the patient became comatose. Neither an electroencephalogram (EEG) nor brain scan were performed, as these technologies are not available in most hospitals in Mozambique, including Pemba Provincial Hospital. Malaria tests performed on days one, three and four were all negative. Results of a urine test performed on day four found that cyto-chemical parameters were within the normal range (pH = 6.8, specific density = 1025, nitrite, protein, ketone, bilirubin and blood all negative, leukocytes = 4/\u03bcL and red blood cells = 2/\u03bcL). Urine culture was negative. During hospitalization the patient was treated with the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ampicillin.\\nThe broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was continued since leukocytosis and lymphocytosis persisted. On day five the patient began to recover and woke from coma. Blood pressure remained controlled throughout the admission.\\nThe patient\u2019s clinical presentation improved progressively and on day seven the Hgb level was 8.8 g/dL, the leukocyte count and ALT level had dropped to 16.4 \u00d7 103 cell/mm3 and 155 U/L, respectively, and the platelet count had increased to 182 \u00d7 103 cell/mm3. He was discharged from hospital on the same day with intermittent low grade melaena, but with neither epigastric pain nor hematemesis. On day 12 he returned for a follow-up visit and presented a normal leukocyte, lymphocyte and platelet count, the Hgb had increased to 10 g/dL, but the ALT was still slightly elevated at 155 U/L. The patient reported continuing intermittent low grade melaena.\\nOn day 40, the patient complained of malaise and intermittent low grade melaena and was transferred to a private hospital in Maputo City, the capital of the country, where he was followed up as an outpatient. On day 44 various tests were performed, including full blood count, chest X ray and clinical chemistry, but all were normal (see Table ). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no evident cause of melaena: the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum were normal. Colonoscopy was also normal.\\nBlood samples were sent to the Centre for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases of the National Institute of Communicable Disease in South Africa for Dengue testing. No serological evidence of Dengue was found using an in house developed haemagglutination inhibition test (HAI) and a commercial Dengue IgM capture Enzyme Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA, Panbio, Australia). In addition, the sample was submitted to a wider arboviral screen, and was positive for CHIKV using the CHIKV HAI and commercial IgM ELISA for CHIKV (Eurommune, Germany). These findings clearly point to a recent infection by CHIKV. The patient was treated with antacids and antibiotics. At the follow up visit on day 60 he had completely recovered and was without melaena or any other remaining sequelae.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26643534': 1, '30856200': 1, '19439849': 1, '23029573': 1, '19842379': 1, '22301475': 1, '25955774': 1, '5355242': 1, '17448932': 1, '26473605': 1, '18227590': 1, '26305812': 1, '19716149': 1, '20436958': 1, '27208636': 1, '25734165': 1, '26488312': 1, '20507772': 1, '18256441': 1, '4688831': 1, '17978079': 1, '23912863': 1, '25541718': 1, '18835614': 1, '19274635': 1, '19535840': 1, '19893613': 1, '19259263': 1, '712084': 1, '18598641': 1, '18290551': 1, '19710977': 1, '18061059': 1, '26060423': 1, '26626342': 1, '25657139': 1, '25806915': 1, '22693937': 1, '21265260': 1, '23764023': 1, '30208017': 1, '26986769': 1, '18325255': 1, '22348166': 1, '27088710': 1, '17479933': 1, '18694529': 1, '30897135': 1, '29415070': 1, '19581242': 1, '18679124': 1, '25078691': 1, '26517488': 1, '26793440': 1, '28179029': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
