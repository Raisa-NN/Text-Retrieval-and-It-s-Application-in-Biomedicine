Her medical history revealed that she had two caesarean deliveries in the past, but she had no chronic disease.On physical examination, we detected a 2\u00d72cm painless hard tumor without signs of inflammation at the level of the urethral meatus (Figure ). Her urethroscopy results were normal. Flexible cystoscopy showed tumor in her distal urethra at the level between 3 o\u2019clock and 6 o\u2019clock position.\\nOn confirming the position, she was operated under spinal anesthesia. The tumor was resected with suburethral incision (U-shaped inverted). The urethra was calibrated with an 18-French Foley catheter, and an indwelling Foley\u2019s catheter was kept inserted for 10 days. She was discharged from the hospital on the second day.Histopathological study of the tumor revealed spindle-shaped smooth muscle fibers in a whirling pattern (Figure ), confirming the diagnosis of leiomyoma.\\nThe Foley catheter was removed on the 10th day. Her postoperative recovery was uneventful. She was symptom-free at the time of her last follow-up; complaints like fistula, dyspareunia, infection, and incontinence were not reported.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15881563': 1, '12890968': 1, '34508403': 1, '22844631': 2, '9934805': 1, '16244489': 1, '17437842': 1, '26224380': 1, '15751418': 1, '25391855': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3403117-1': 1}"}
