Her illness began with general fatigue and appetite loss on the day before hospital admission. Acute liver failure was diagnosed and she was started on steroid injections, entecavir, and fresh frozen plasma supplementation for 12 days, but disturbance of consciousness appeared and she was transferred to our hospital. At admission, her consciousness level represented stage 3 encephalopathy (Glasgow Coma Scale E2V2M4). CT examination revealed marked liver atrophy. Daily on-line HDF and PE were promptly started. She completely recovered from encephalopathy after six daily sessions of on-line HDF. Her consciousness remained clear with daily on-line HDF. On the 10th hospital day, CT revealed no sign of liver regeneration, and the estimated liver volume was 592 mL. Liver transplantation was performed and the weight of her extracted liver was 700 g.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'2379971': 1, '33083557': 1, '12517233': 1, '11417951': 1, '12169845': 1, '10051463': 1, '8444078': 1, '14767999': 1, '17975845': 1, '11870389': 1, '9726220': 1, '15138219': 1, '18318440': 1, '11147252': 1, '10737166': 1, '11518785': 1, '10230890': 1, '31015539': 1, '16125082': 1, '26494959': 1, '11095657': 1, '639371': 1, '12649536': 1, '10344362': 1, '3987292': 1, '716037': 1, '6401320': 1, '15197097': 1, '11682665': 1, '8828772': 1, '812083': 1, '14049': 1, '13322975': 1, '6762189': 1, '12637132': 1, '10848672': 1, '14733302': 1, '11522866': 1, '7759146': 1, '20492684': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2898817-1': 2}"}
