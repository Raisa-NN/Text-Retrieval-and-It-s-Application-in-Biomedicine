The patient required ICU treatment with NIMV for 5 days (IPAP=12 cmH20, EPAP=7 cmH20), and 10 days of hydrocortisone treatment (used due availability). The patient recovered without complications. Seven days after discharge, the patient was readmitted to the ED owing to the deterioration of his general status, acute pleuritic pain in the left hemothorax, and sudden dyspnea symptoms. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg, heart rate was 108 beats/min, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 83%. The patient received 2 L/min of supplementary oxygen. Physical examination showed jugular vein distention and intercostal retractions.\\nAfter arrival, he was placed on an HFNC. An X-ray was obtained in the ED with a portable X-ray system, which demonstrated a large left-sided apical tension pneumothorax with the collapse of the left lung (Figure ). A left thoracostomy tube was immediately placed under sterile conditions, and he was referred to the ICU respiratory service.\\nFortunately, the patient responded to treatment, and he was hemodynamically stabilized. A standing chest X-ray performed on day 6 of admission after the removal of the thoracostomy tube showed a complete reexpansion of his left lung indicative of resolution of the problem. He remained stable and was discharged seven days later.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'32959730': 1, '10903694': 1, '32978337': 1, '34532191': 2, '34079341': 1, '32174129': 1, '32312571': 1, '34796074': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8590743-1': 2, '8435398-1': 1}"}
