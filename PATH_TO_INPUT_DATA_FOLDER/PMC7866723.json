During examination he was alert, conscious and oriented. Visual acuity of the right eye was 20/20 and right eye complete ophthalmic examination was normal. Visual acuity of the left eye was no light perception. There was periorbital hematoma causing lid swelling and the globe was intact. The pupil was dilated, did not react to light, and showed a relative afferent pupil defect response. The anterior segment was unremarkable apart from subconjunctival hemorrhage temporally. Retinal examination revealed patches of hemorrhage around the optic disc with complete avulsion of optic disc []. A non-contrast axial computed tomography scan of the left orbit [] confirmed a widened and altered optic nerve -globe junction. At 6months following the injury, there was no improvement in vision in the left eye. Follow up magnetic resonance imaging of the left orbit [] confirmed persistent disruption in the lamina cribrosa region. Over the next several months the child developed left esotropia. Three years after the injury, the child had 40 prism diopters left esotropia and no signs of phthisis bulbi.", "age": "[[10.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10204137': 1, '16556619': 1, '1437015': 1, '8066541': 1, '10577547': 1, '9152130': 1, '19141147': 1, '10507572': 1, '24172569': 1, '30181462': 1, '29628672': 1, '34285804': 2, '33575538': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8278239-1': 1}"}
