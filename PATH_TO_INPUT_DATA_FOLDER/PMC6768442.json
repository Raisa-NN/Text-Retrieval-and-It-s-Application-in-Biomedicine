No haemoptysis or chest pain was reported. He was a farmer and an active smoker of 35 pack-years. His medical history was negative for previous relevant conditions; thus, he was not on any medication. He denied drug abuse or allergies. Poor oral hygiene and an irregular diet with a frequent consumption of alcohol with meals (one or two glasses of wine) were reported by the patient. At admission, cyanosis and clubbing were absent. Blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, pulse was 97 beats/min, respiratory rate was 21 breaths/min, temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, and oxygen peripheral saturation was 96% in room air. Physical examination showed absence of lung sound in the upper and medium area of the right haemithorax. Initial laboratory exams were remarkable for a white cell count of 15.4\u00b7103/\u03bcL with a predominant neutrophil count of 89% and for a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 158.2 mg/L.\\nChest X-ray (Fig. A, black arrows) and a consecutive chest computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. C, E, G) demonstrated an organized pleural effusion on the right side associated with a basal lesion containing air inside and two dense consolidations in the left and right superior lobes. A chest CT-guided transthoracic fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the right basal lesion was performed. During this procedure, due to the presence of purulent liquid, we also performed a pleural aspiration, in which we removed 230 cc of dense and purulent liquid rich in neutrophils. Cultures of this pleural liquid were negative for pathogens. A flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy was also performed. Cultures of the sample obtained by bronchial aspirate showed colonies of A. odontolyticus and Veillonella atypica. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry for the identification of pathogens was performed. The Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) (Fig. A) and Grocott (Fig. B) colourations identify the fungal hyphae in a cytological sample of bronchial aspirate. Transbronchial biopsy samples demonstrated purulent non-specific inflammation, and no neoplastic cells were observed. Culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. The orthopantomogram indicated severe periodontal disease with diffuse dental caries.\\nThe patient was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with metronidazole (1500 mg/day) and piperacillin-tazobactam (13.5 g/day) for a duration of three weeks. His clinical condition improved significantly, CRP dropped to 3.15 mg/L, and the chest X-ray showed (Fig. B) reduction in the pulmonary lesions. He was discharged home with metronidazole (1500 mg/day) for a further 14 days. On follow up at three months, CT showed complete resolution (Fig. D, F, H).", "age": "[[65.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'32655519': 1, '26146575': 2, '25788515': 1, '27085876': 1, '25865197': 1, '12662015': 1, '31576208': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4471307-1': 1, '4471307-2': 1}"}
