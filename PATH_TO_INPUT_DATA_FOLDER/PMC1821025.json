Past medical history was significant for cancer of the right lung, treated with right pneumonectomy 1 year before. Routine blood test were within normal limits as well as common neoplastic markers. The rectal exam showed a well defined mass on the left-anterior aspect of the anal canal, beginning at 1 cm from anal verge and extending cranially for about 4 cm. Endoanal ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a 4 \u00d7 2 cm mass in the thickness of the sphincteric muscles (Fig and ). Total body CT scan confirmed the presence of the mass and did not show any lymph node enlargement in the proximity or distant metastases. The mass appeared circumscribed and not infiltrating the surrounding tissues (Fig. ).\\nThe patient was brought to the operating room, placed in jack-knife position, and a local excision was carried out, resecting just a small amount of fibers of the anal sphincter. This has been possible since the mass was well capsulated and not firmly adherent to the surrounding structures. Gross pathological examination showed a 3.5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.2 cm fibrous-elastic mass. Histological examination showed a proliferation of densely packed spindle cells, with prominent nuclear palisading (Fig. ). Nuclear atypia was absent and mitotic count was of 4 mitosis/50HPF. Neoplastic cells showed diffuse and marked cytoplasmic positivity for KIT protein and CD34 in the majority of cells (Fig. ). Neoplastic cells were negative for desmin that stained residual smooth muscle fibers of bowel wall at the margins of the neoplasm. A diagnosis of GIST, with low risk aggressive behavior was made (Table )[], therefore no further treatment was necessary.\\nPostoperative course was uneventful. No implications on anal continence were observed and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 3. The patient underwent follow up at 6 and at 12 months, and rectal ultrasonography as well as CT scan did not show local recurrence or distant spread.", "age": "[[78.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12528772': 1, '29416307': 1, '30881087': 2, '17064855': 1, '14628161': 1, '11287975': 1, '15717486': 1, '6743978': 1, '20436835': 1, '24293969': 1, '16733203': 1, '16858179': 1, '11293450': 1, '16741319': 1, '21054898': 2, '4819271': 1, '15648083': 1, '23585972': 2, '11896121': 1, '11281173': 1, '10435565': 1, '22684345': 1, '26893795': 1, '9891765': 1, '12094370': 1, '9438854': 1, '15622586': 1, '11688571': 1, '28006721': 1, '1612575': 1, '17090188': 1, '17096729': 1, '24415888': 1, '17306018': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6402437-1': 1, '2993706-1': 1, '3621153-1': 1}"}
