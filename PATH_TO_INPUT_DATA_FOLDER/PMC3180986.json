Clinical examination revealed central cyanosis and Grade 3 clubbing of digits. On precordial examination there was a Grade 3/6 Crescendo-decrescendo murmur along the upper left sternal border. A short mid diastolic rumble was heard at the apex with the patient in the left lateral position. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed a malaligned ventricular septal defect (VSD) with aortic override. It also showed presence of divided left atrium (suggestive of Cor triatriatum) [, ] and aneurysmally dilated left and right coronary arteries giving horizontal figure of eight appearance []. There was no evidence of aortic regurgitation (AR) or hypertension. Cine angiogram showed malaligned type of ventricular septal defect with aortic override and a well-developed left ventricle (LV) []. An aortic root angiogram revealed dilated coronary arteries and no evidence of AR. Selective coronary angiogram showed aneurysmally dilated left coronary artery with contrast entering the left ventricle almost immediately []. This confirmed the presence of coronary artery fistulae draining from left coronary artery to left ventricle. Selective coronary angiogram of right coronary artery also showed a dilated right coronary artery.", "age": "[[10.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15680057': 1, '2071255': 1, '16103577': 1, '11516041': 1, '21976888': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
