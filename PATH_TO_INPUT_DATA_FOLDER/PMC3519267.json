There were similar episodes since two years with gradual subsidence of swelling without any treatment. Patient also gave the history of minor trauma prior to each episode. However; there was no history of wheals, associated systemic complaints, drug intake, food allergy, and similar complaints in family.\\nOn cutaneous examination, there was edema of eyelids, left cheek, and lips.

Swelling gradually subsided over a period of three days [Figures and ].\\nLaboratory investigations including complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, urine examination, antinuclear antibody test, chest X-ray, and X-ray of paranasal sinuses were all within normal limit. Considering the history of repeated episodes of angioedema without wheals without any precipitating factor with no response to usual line of management special investigations like complement C4 and C1 esterase inhibitor levels were done. Complement C4 and C1 esterase inhibitor levels were 1.44 mg /dl (N 10 -40 mg/dl) and 38 mg /L (N 275 \u2013 400 mg/L), respectively, suggested the diagnosis of HAE (type 1). C1q level was not done because of unavailability of the test in India.\\nPatient was started on stanozolol 2 mg thrice a day with no recurrence in one year of follow-up.", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1518394': 1, '10963200': 1, '2926086': 1, '3084606': 1, '30514395': 2, '518825': 1, '14046003': 1, '23248378': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6280524-1': 1}"}
