Five years earlier, he underwent a left knee meniscectomy for a posttraumatic medial meniscus tear. Because of persisting pain and swelling of the medial compartment (typical post-meniscectomy syndrome) he underwent synthetic PCU (polycarbonate-urethane) meniscus replacement (type NUsurfaceR), which resulted in regain of full functionality. However, he started experiencing a clicking sensation and sometimes a complete blockage of his left knee a few weeks prior to the consultation. A computed tomography (CT) arthrography was performed. On the coronal view (Figure ) there was a complete opacification of the medial femorotibial joint space devoid of any meniscal structure, together with a degenerative tibial subchondral geode (arrow). The sagittal (Figure ) and axial (Figure ) views showed a hypodense, wedge-shaped structure in the suprapatellar space: the luxated and superiorly migrated synthetic meniscus (arrows).", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31210969': 1, '23100123': 1, '30345418': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
