He had fractures of T2 to T4 vertebrae, which were unstable and required urgent fixation. He also suffered a left rib fracture resulting in a pneumothorax. He had a long stay in ITU due to slow clinical progress, but even after discharge to the ward, had repeated admissions to HDU for recurrent episodes of hypotension and hyperkalaemia. Eventually 88 days after admission, an endocrine opinion was sought. A short synacthen test was performed which was grossly abnormal (basal cortisol of 7 nmol/L rising to 9 nmol/L at 30 min). Pituitary function testing showed an intact gonadotrophin and thyroid axis with normal prolactin (TSH 1.91 mU/L, FT4 18.3 pmol/L, FT3 5.5 pmol/L, LH 3.3 IU/L, FSH 5.6 IU/L, testosterone 11.6 nmol/L, prolactin 163 mIU/L).\\nAfter starting steroid replacement he improved significantly and was subsequently discharged home on steroid replacement. This diagnosis was confirmed as an outpatient three months later, with a persistent grossly subnormal repeat short synacthen test. He had two CT scans three years apart which showed no signs of damage to his adrenal glands.", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1738984': 1, '18376696': 1, '17252249': 1, '19574315': 1, '19474430': 1, '12594318': 1, '21969884': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3184013-1': 2}"}
