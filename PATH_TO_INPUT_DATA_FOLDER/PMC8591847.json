Radiological examination revealed a cyst measuring 10 mm \u00d7 8 mm in the left upper lung (Fig. ). The doctor in our department included LCCA as a differential diagnosis due to the previous case and suggested that the patient undergo further diagnostic tests for clarification. Laboratory findings showed elevated serum levels of NSE (18.07 ng/mL, normal 0\u201316.30 ng/mL), CEA, and cytokeratin fragment 21-1 (CYFRA21-1), whereas other routine laboratory investigations and pulmonary function test results were normal. After the failure of percutaneous CT-guided biopsy of the solitary multicystic lesion, a left upper lobectomy was performed using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).\\nThe pathological results showed that invasive adenocarcinoma was found in the cyst region, and almost all components were acinar (Fig. ). The lesion was completely excised. After the operation, he did not receive any additional chemotherapy and recovered well.", "age": "[[56.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'32965296': 1, '31026681': 1, '31615350': 1, '24354425': 1, '25620598': 1, '31019789': 1, '25034586': 1, '13179120': 1, '31446982': 1, '22997368': 1, '21458181': 1, '31038723': 1, '31080850': 1, '29652577': 1, '32363512': 1, '30946341': 1, '25279848': 1, '30422775': 1, '32548161': 1, '32699925': 1, '28338535': 1, '32755209': 1, '3006277': 1, '30412112': 2, '34775945': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8591847-1': 2, '6221603-1': 1}"}
