During the surgical procedure of heart-beating organ donation, the left kidney was found with multiple RAs. Furthermore, during the back-table allograft preparation, the left kidney was found to have three RAs: one main RA and two accessory RAs. The main RA and the accessory RAs arose from the abdominal aorta (Figure ). The three RAs were preserved on the common aortic patch (Carrel patch) (Figure ) for the cadaveric renal transplantation procedure []. The ureter and the renal vein were normal and without any anatomical variation.\\nA 58-year-old woman with polycystic kidney disease and chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis over the past five years presented to our renal transplantation unit as a potential transplant recipient. After the preoperative evaluation, our patient underwent heterotopic renal transplantation. Via a Rutherford-Morrison incision, the left renal allograft was placed to the right iliac fossa. The renal vein was anastomosed end-to-side to the external iliac vein; the Carrel patch was anastomosed end-to-side to the internal iliac artery; an extravesical ureteroneocystostomy (Lich-Gregoir) using a pigtail was performed [].\\nThe operation was uneventful and nine years postoperatively, the renal allograft recipient remains fit and healthy, with normal renal function.", "age": "[[42.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26945775': 1, '17232579': 1, '1589852': 1, '20639669': 1, '28933184': 1, '15378279': 1, '31461596': 1, '29802718': 1, '19414954': 1, '16372339': 1, '22508263': 1, '18521812': 1, '11372607': 1, '20809045': 1, '23161057': 1, '25607403': 1, '17160802': 1, '31912116': 1, '33376651': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
