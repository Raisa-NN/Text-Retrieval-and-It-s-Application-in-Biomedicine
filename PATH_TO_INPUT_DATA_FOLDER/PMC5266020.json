Thirty-one days ago, headache and diplopia symptoms were aggravated obviously, the patient appeared projectile vomiting. On a clinical basis, tuberculous (TB) meningitis was diagnosed in the local hospital, and the patient was given treatment measures such as anti-TB, reducing the intracranial pressure and oral dexamethasone. Twenty-six days ago, he presented with low-grade fever from noon to night in the next 7 days and the maximum temperature was 38\u00b0C.
