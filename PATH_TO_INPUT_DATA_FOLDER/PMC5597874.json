The patient had slipped and fallen on her upper back, and she complained of progressively aggravating dyspnea at rest. Then, within the chest x-ray of trauma survey, found an incidentally huge mass occupying the left lung, irrelevant to the trauma. There was no past medical history, and the only surgical history consisted of one cesarean section 3 years prior to the visit. The patient was married and had four children. She was a non-smoker and had no recent history of traveling, weight loss or expectoration.\\nExamination showed that the patient was stable with mild tenderness on palpation of the posterior upper back. Auscultation demonstrated absent breath sounds on the left. An abdomen examination concluded that there were splenomegaly.\\nChest x-ray showed well-defined huge opacity of most left hemithorax with a shift of mediastinum to the right (Fig. ). CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast revealed 20 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 18 cm3 well-defined mixed cystic lesion within the left lung containing multiple parts of the heterogeneous density with soft tissue elements and fat content. It also showed spots of wall calcification, where the lesion probably originated from the mediastinum, involving most of the left hemithorax. The mass compressed the mediastinal structures, great vessels, and airways (Fig. ). It is surrounded by a consolidation collapsed with a marked shift of mediastinum to the right side (Figs and ). No mediastinal lymphadenopathy and the right lung was clear. The spleen was enlarged with multiple cysts that varied in size with no significant enhancement post IV contrast in arterial and portal phases (Figs and ). The liver was unremarkable. Hematological tests were within normal limits. Mantoux test and Sputum culture were negative.\\nThe decision was to perform a standard left anterolateral thoracotomy to remove the thoracic tumor after expiration because the cystic tumor was found to be very congested and vulnerable to rupture during the extraction (Fig. ). It emptied a large amount of thick, white/yellowish fluid and hair particles (Fig. ). The size of the tumor was extremely large, although no invasion to the mediastinum, vessels or to the airway had occurred. The tumor detached from the phrenic angle, diaphragm and all of the surrounding structures without any bleeding, air leak or complications. A laparoscopic splenectomy was done in the same session, and the spleen was extracted through the old cesarean incision scar for cosmetic purposes; the spleen shows multiple cysts on both visceral and diaphragmatic surfaces (Figs and ).\\nThe patient was discharged on the 5th postoperative day. Histopathological examination revealed numerous fluid with soft tissue, squamous epithelium, adipose tissue, hair particles and calcification at the wall, which suggests benign mature intrapulmonary teratoma. The spleen contained multiple cysts that varied in size with mural calcification, which suggests cystic lymphangiomatosis of the spleen. The patient showed a good response in the follow-up with normal vital signs and labs.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11702124': 1, '19938204': 1, '13669833': 1, '23192513': 1, '3257108': 1, '1501269': 1, '15256634': 1, '15562855': 1, '28928924': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
