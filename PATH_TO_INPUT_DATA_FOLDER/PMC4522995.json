Two days prior, the patient had visited the emergency department and was found to have a serum glucose greater than 600 mg/dL and no ketonemia. Prior to this she had no known history of diabetes. She briefly received insulin and intravenous fluids but was sent home on metformin and sitagliptin when she declined to use insulin at home. She then returned with worsening involuntary movements.\\nPhysical examination was remarkable for choreiform and ballistic movements of the right upper and lower extremities. These movements did not lessen with sleep. Laboratory evaluation again showed severe hyperglycemia without evidence of ketonemia. CT scan and MR with diffusion-weighted imaging showed abnormalities in the left basal ganglia suggesting possible hyperglycemia-related hemichorea-hemiballismus syndrome with no evidence of stroke (, ). Aggressive insulin treatment led to eventual resolution of her abnormal movements, although they did not fully resolve until almost 1 month later.", "age": "[[66.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22383069': 1, '32005905': 1, '32432159': 2, '23520380': 1, '19305947': 1, '32409348': 1, '9613501': 1, '27549630': 2, '25387546': 1, '24243539': 1, '26251692': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7236990-1': 1, '4994197-1': 1}"}
