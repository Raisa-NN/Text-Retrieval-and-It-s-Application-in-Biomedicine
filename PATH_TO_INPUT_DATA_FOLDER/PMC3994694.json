Computed tomography (CT) showed four space-occupying hyperdense lesions with prominent surrounding edema and enhancement in a left fronto-temporal, parietal/paramedian, occipital, and right central/periventricular localization []. The removal of the fronto-temporal mass was complicated by an extracranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-containing cyst finally treated by duroplasty. Histology showed typical features of RDD. Two years later, because of persistence of the remaining lesions, the left parietal one was operated, and the others were treated successfully by chemotherapy following the CHOP regimen as in case 1. Since then, the patient has now been free from recurrences for 7 years.", "age": "[[39.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22652821': 1, '32661485': 1, '29720485': 1, '19659569': 1, '34221623': 1, '32983353': 1, '21557191': 1, '7680764': 1, '17380248': 1, '15764118': 1, '22029938': 1, '2180012': 1, '22725985': 1, '20350368': 1, '24778918': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3994694-1': 2}"}
