He stated that his current symptoms were quite different from his usual anxiety attack symptoms. He experienced recurrent pressure-like sensations in his chest. An examination of his vital signs and a physical examination yielded unremarkable findings except for the presence of bilateral DELCs. He stated that he discovered these in his twenties (Figure ). An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a normal sinus rhythm with ST depression. His serial cardiac enzyme levels were normal. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% with no wall motion abnormalities. Due to the persistent symptoms and EKG findings, further testing with a coronary angiogram was performed and revealed an 80% occlusion of the right coronary artery (Figure ). The patient underwent angioplasty, and we inserted drug-eluting stents (Figure ).", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1404022': 1, '24982122': 1, '34729196': 1, '26868940': 1, '28438303': 1, '32913483': 1, '32281613': 1, '28733570': 1, '28442093': 1, '4718047': 1, '32712879': 1, '25983126': 1, '27824539': 1, '8629656': 1, '29560293': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
