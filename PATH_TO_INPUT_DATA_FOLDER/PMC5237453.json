The physical examination was negative for pain, palpable mass in pelvic region, or other genitourinary (GU) symptoms. Blood tests showed white blood cell count (WBC) of 8,700/mm3 with lymphocytic predominance (68%); haemoglobin of 12.4 g/dl; platelet count of 339,000/mm3; C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) within normal limits. Urinalysis revealed a gold yellow colour; pH 5.5; specific gravity 1.020; proteins 30 mg/dl; plenty of red blood cells/High Power Field, pus cells 7\u201310/High Power Field. Urine culture was sterile. Ultrasound (US) scan of the bladder () documented a vegetating mass in the lumen with maximum size of about 40 \u00d7 41 mm, polylobed morphology and irregular contours, characterized by solid heterogeneous echogenicity and weak vascular signs at Colour-Doppler evaluation. Close to the above described mass, another sessile formation of about 6 mm was projected in the lumen. In light of that US aspect, an explorative cystoscopy was performed (). It revealed a nonbleeding lesion, white-coloured, apparently pedunculated, projecting into the lumen next to the left anterolateral wall of the bladder, and associated with a satellite formation of brown colour. Because the cystoscopic features were not clear and an infective origin could not be excluded, the patient underwent an open biopsy. The histological report showed a pseudocystic, multilocular gelatinous, and moderately fluctuating formation of 52 \u00d7 45 \u00d7 11 mm and a brownish minute fragment of solid tissue of 7 \u00d7 7 mm. Both findings displayed features of mixed Botryoid and Spindle Cell type of Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma. The child was transferred to the pediatric oncology department to start on a chemotherapy cycle, according to RMS 2005 protocol of European Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Group (EPSSG) [] in patients with standard risk, using IVA (ifosfamide, actinomycin D, and vincristine) associations.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22857841': 1, '7636557': 1, '22248972': 1, '24400293': 1, '17689957': 1, '15754335': 1, '10337369': 1, '28116202': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
