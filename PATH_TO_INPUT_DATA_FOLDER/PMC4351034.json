A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 15-mm, weakly enhancing mass at the ampulla of Vater () and dilatation of the bile duct. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a mass with rough and reddish mucosa at the ampulla (). Biopsy of the mucosa indicated adenocarcinoma. For biliary decompression, a transpapillary, fully covered, self-expandable metal stent (FCSEMS) (10\u00d750 mm Bonastent; Standard Sci-Tech, Seoul, Korea) was deployed. Four days later, the patient developed acute cholangitis. Because stent obstruction or migration was suspected, endoscopic carbon dioxide cholangiography was performed, which revealed kinking of the CBD 1 cm above the proximal end of the FCSEMS (). A 7-F double-pigtail plastic stent (100 mm; Olympus Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) was therefore placed through the FCSEMS to correct the kink, straightening the CBD () and improving cholangitis.", "age": "[[72.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23103324': 1, '16650540': 1, '21951091': 1, '20438890': 1, '21788992': 1, '21198917': 1, '25024600': 1, '25721004': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
