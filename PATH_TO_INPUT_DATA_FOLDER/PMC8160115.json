He was diagnosed with uveitis and treated at the Department of Ophthalmology. On admission, he developed periodic fever accompanied by bloody diarrhea. Physical examination revealed oral aphthous ulcers without genital ulcers or erythema nodosum. Leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 10,200/\u03bcL) and anemia (hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL) were detected in complete blood cell counts. Although, the liver and kidney function parameters were within normal limits, severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin: 1.7 g/dL, normal range 4.1\u20135.1) was seen. Serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (8.717 mg/dL, normal range <0.14) and IgG (2,492 mg/dL, normal range 861\u20131,747) were elevated. The patient's human leukocyte antigen was B54, and neither anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody nor anti-nuclear antibody was positive. No pathogenic bacteria were detected in blood or stool cultures.", "age": "[[69.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21530742': 1, '18422560': 1, '25268669': 1, '27270893': 1, '17620363': 1, '32327746': 1, '15260992': 1, '16143103': 1, '20389019': 1, '30341905': 1, '28811236': 1, '31132297': 1, '32662405': 1, '29471416': 1, '24883128': 1, '33446282': 1, '32827951': 1, '25043027': 1, '28373582': 1, '34055846': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
