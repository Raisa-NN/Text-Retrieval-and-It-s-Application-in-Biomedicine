We performed stent-assisted coil embolization using the jailing technique for 2 aneurysms one by one in a single procedure under general anesthesia. This procedure was successful, resulting in complete occlusion of aneurysmal sacs, and the Solitaire AB stent was detached by the electrical detachment system (Fig. ). Final cerebral angiography revealed that the stent was deployed in optimal position across the neck of aneurysm and the distal markers were placed optimally without entering into branching arteries or perforators. However, we found that the proximal marker moved from the upper part of the cavernous segment of the ICA to the MHT after detachment of the stent (Fig. ). We checked the patient's condition with postoperative magnetic resonance images including diffusion-weighted images and hormonal studies. The patient has no complications or other symptoms.", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23386222': 1, '10445445': 1, '21990459': 1, '30283318': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
