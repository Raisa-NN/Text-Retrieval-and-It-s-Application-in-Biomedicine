A preoperative plain CT scan revealed a well-demarcated tumor (maximum length 40 mm) at the left obtulator fossa in contact with the left lateral wall of the rectum. He underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and a tumor biopsy via the retroperitoneal route. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed it consisted of spindle tumor cells STAT6 (+), CD34 (+), DOG1 (\u2212), cKIT (\u2212), S100 (\u2212), Desmin (\u2212), CDK4 (\u2212), PAX8 (\u2212), and Ki67 positivity < 1% by immunohistochemistry. The tumor was diagnosed as SFT. A preoperative MRI after intraoperative biopsy revealed the tumor was a well-demarcated T1 and T2 low intensity tumor. In FDG-PET, an accumulation of SUVmax 2.3 corresponding to a mass was observed ().", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23313952': 1, '31211074': 1, '30481195': 1, '11920476': 1, '30342279': 1, '15674506': 1, '26190119': 1, '16363659': 1, '22082190': 1, '32442915': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7240175-1': 2}"}
