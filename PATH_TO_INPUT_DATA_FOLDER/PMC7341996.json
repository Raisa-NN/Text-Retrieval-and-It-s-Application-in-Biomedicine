In addition, he had experienced a syncopal episode 3 days prior to his presentation. The syncope occurred in the kitchen shortly after the patient got out of bed, without any prodromal symptoms and with a very brief loss of consciousness. Twenty years ago, he experienced a similar event while being febrile. There was no relevant family history.\\nOn examination, the patient was febrile (38.6\u202f\u00b0C) with otherwise stable vital signs. Chest radiography showed a left-sided and possible right-sided consolidation. Laboratory data demonstrated an elevated C\u2011reactive protein level (100\u202fmg/l) and lactate dehydrogenase (508\u202fU/l) and lymphopenia (0.8\u202f\u00d7 109/l). The electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia of 100 beats per minute and a borderline Brugada type 1\u2011like ECG pattern in lead V1 (Fig. ).\\nThe patient was placed on airborne isolation precautions in a dedicated COVID-19 unit with telemetry monitoring and received antipyretic therapy (paracetamol 1000\u202fmg QID). He tested positive for COVID-19. The patient\u2019s fever improved and the ECG showed a sinus rhythm of 78 beats per minute and resolution of the Brugada-like ECG pattern (Fig. ). The patient continues to be admitted and no arrhythmias have been observed.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34791154': 1, '34864876': 1, '27033637': 1, '32244059': 1, '33984098': 2, '33490967': 1, '32311532': 1, '32309815': 1, '29649615': 1, '34307588': 2, '32292696': 1, '23872691': 1, '20100972': 1, '34564341': 2, '34760421': 2, '19843921': 1, '32643073': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7341996-1': 2, '8572016-1': 1, '8283591-1': 1, '8040451-1': 1, '8482132-1': 1}"}
