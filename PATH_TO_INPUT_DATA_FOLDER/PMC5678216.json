Her clinical status was compatible with WFNS grade-V (GCS E1/V1/M4). According to her family, she did not have any significant past medical history. Her brain CT scan revealed a diffuse IVH, and a large ICH in the left prefrontal area with an estimated volume of 56 mL (). Her brain CTA and DSA revealed a 12 mm ruptured right-IC-Ophthalmic aneurysm (). She underwent endovascular coil embolization using 7 coils (: preoperative, : postoperative), which was followed by SRH and EVD (: postoperative). Seven days later, a brain CT scan revealed a significant decrease in ICH and IVH (: postoperative 7 days). She was transferred to a rehabilitation center. At 6-months postoperatively, the patient still showed a stupor mental state, which was compatible with a GOS of 2 (persistent vegetative state).", "age": "[[39.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9444915': 1, '17277557': 2, '703933': 1, '9254078': 1, '1635623': 1, '2080361': 1, '46957': 1, '3808238': 1, '2651586': 1, '11311472': 1, '6379125': 1, '9744840': 1, '14609163': 1, '10492680': 1, '14023947': 1, '5635959': 1, '17449171': 1, '19057320': 1, '9584279': 1, '3354367': 1, '2926492': 1, '7221876': 1, '9368552': 1, '9059730': 1, '5921326': 1, '18136707': 1, '7946023': 1, '14633294': 1, '15767506': 1, '3434346': 1, '19096545': 1, '2222242': 1, '3915660': 1, '9731619': 1, '6827342': 1, '7731513': 1, '8339456': 1, '2462689': 1, '22465372': 1, '9445359': 1, '3484561': 1, '15344897': 1, '3236024': 1, '8322400': 1, '7792692': 1, '3394543': 1, '9818860': 1, '8711791': 1, '6182486': 1, '2305356': 1, '10063358': 1, '19390774': 1, '7942196': 1, '8290048': 1, '29152466': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5678216-1': 2, '2626701-1': 1, '2626701-2': 1}"}
