She had suffered a complete degloving of the leg with multiple bone fractures in a car accident 5 years before. Treatment had been successful in saving the limb, but a nonhealing wound with tibial exposure developed. An angiographic study showed patency of the peroneal artery only, the reason why recourse to free flaps had been excluded. The persistent lesion had been repetitively treated with adipose tissue grafts, negative pressure therapy, and other advanced biointeractive skin dressings without any improvement. The burden of the wound even led the patient to consider amputation as an option. We performed a surgical debridement () as part of a multiple-step surgical plan, but then the patient refused further surgery and was directed to outpatient clinic follow-up. Dressing changes were performed with standard saline solution alone for 5 months, with no substantial improvement. Then the patient became pregnant, and surprisingly the lesion started to heal (). By the sixth month of pregnancy, granulation tissue completely covered the bone and filled the ulcer, which displayed significantly reduced diameters (). The patient moved back to her home country for delivery and was lost to follow-up.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16449322': 1, '1827758': 1, '16801750': 1, '25713751': 1, '15147994': 1, '12208862': 1, '16404237': 1, '15795118': 1, '9359694': 1, '17276202': 1, '21369728': 1, '16297209': 1, '23837112': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
