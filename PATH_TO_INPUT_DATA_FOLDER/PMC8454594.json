The patient presented high fever, severe headache, and purulent nasal secretions over the last three days but his vital parameters were normal. Apart from his statement that he was a tobacco smoker, no previous medical conditions were reported.\\nInitially, one week prior to hospitalization, he was diagnosed with inflammation of the paranasal sinusitis by a private otorhinolaryngologist who had prescribed a combined antibacterial medical treatment of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium and clindamycin. However, five days later, he was referred to the emergency department (ED) of the rural hospital with epileptic seizure. Regarding his medical history, the patient had suffered from sinusitis five years ago but no history of epilepsy was mentioned, not even in his family history.\\nThe CT scan that was performed revealed findings only in the right maxillary, ethmoid, and frontal sinuses but not in the parenchymal brain (Figures , ). Concerning the laboratory results, it was found a leukocytosis of over 20,000 per cubic millimeter of blood, elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and mild electrolyte disturbances. Because of high suspicion for meningitis or encephalitis, the patient was transported by ambulance to our university hospital for further investigation and treatment.\\nFirstly in the neurology department, an intravenous combination of ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and acyclovir was given along with antiepileptics. However, for the following three days, there was no response to the antibiotics. On the contrary, the patient displayed dyspnoea and bradycardia but echocardiography did not demonstrate any pathology. For the dyspnoea, a CT scan of the chest was executed, which revealed pleural effusion and therefore it was decided to modify the antibiotic medication with vancomycin and meropenem.\\nAfter 48 hours of treatment, the patient presented disorientation and abnormal behavior. The MRI of the brain that was performed, indicated the presence of a cerebral abscess in the right frontal lobe surrounded by oedema, which caused a slight displacement of the midline (Figure ). In a new CT scan, shadows in the right frontal sinus accompanied by frontal bone thinning in the lower-posterior wall were observed.\\nA new evaluation was made by the otorhinolaryngologists who decided to proceed operatively. Endoscopically and under general anaesthesia, nasal polyps were detected in the nasal cavity, which were removed with the use of a flexible rhino endoscope. Then anterior ethmoidectomy and middle maxillary antrostomy were done along with drainage of pus from right sinuses. Ten days later, the fever was lower but still high and the leukocytosis was remaining. The patient started having disorientation while his headache was getting worse over days.\\nDue to the unimproved clinical condition, neurosurgeons considered to proceed more drastically. Specifically, under general anaesthesia, a pterional craniotomy was performed and an open approach of the frontal and right temporal lobe was achieved (Figure ). Thereafter, the brain abscess was found in the right frontal lobe and anterior part of the right temporal lobe. The purulent material and the surrounding abscess capsule were completely removed, with intend to eradicate the infectious sources and to decompress the brain parenchyma by lessening intracranial pressure. In addition, samples were taken from the abscess and sent for microbiological study for antibiotic sensitivity. Pus culture was consistent with alpha-hemolytic streptococcus that was sensitive to the antibiotics.\\nSubsequently, the patient was referred to the intensive care unit for constant care and close supervision for five days continuing intravenous antibiotics. The fever subsided within 72 hours. Neurological symptoms started resolving after 15 days and the patient was discharged nearly one month after the last operation presenting mild irritability, which was decreased gradually over the next two months. Six months later, an MRI was implemented where no signs of brain abscess were observed (Figure ). At the time of the last follow-up, one year postoperatively, the patient was found to be totally asymptomatic.", "age": "[[39.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'8953061': 1, '6631519': 1, '30245985': 2, '24848553': 1, '22152572': 1, '26929294': 1, '25075836': 1, '17056261': 1, '11802039': 1, '23607056': 1, '2000009': 1, '23189003': 2, '7708172': 1, '17180609': 1, '20709243': 1, '21087684': 1, '8958173': 1, '16183134': 1, '34567904': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3505342-1': 1, '6147267-1': 1}"}
