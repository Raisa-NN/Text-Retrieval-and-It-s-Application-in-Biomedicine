The patient was asymptomatic and had no significant previous medical history.\\nPhysical examination, electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, chest radiography were unremarkable.\\nCine-MRI (Avanto 1.5 T scanner, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) ruled out myocardial hypertrophy and incidentally revealed an outpouching of the left ventricular inferior wall at the basal level surrounded by a thin layer (4 mm) of hypo-contractile myocardium ().\\nLate gadolinium enhanced (LGE) images showed no hyperintense areas within the LVO myocardial wall (-).\\nIn addition, a mild regurgitating bicuspid aortic valve was depicted (-). The patient rejected surgical intervention and opted for follow-up.", "age": "[[47.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24255656': 2, '25436210': 1, '18377504': 1, '17395681': 1, '15008699': 1, '19130420': 1, '16612072': 1, '17631089': 1, '11205936': 1, '16621715': 1, '24251007': 1, '27500156': 1, '16434275': 1, '19693309': 1, '25544824': 1, '25159202': 1, '17707090': 1, '25262133': 1, '31449631': 2, '26191396': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3831018-1': 1, '6601178-1': 1}"}
