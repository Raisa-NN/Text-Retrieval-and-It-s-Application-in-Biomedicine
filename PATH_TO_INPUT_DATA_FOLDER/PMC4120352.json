Ten years prior, she suffered a head trauma and her past MRI results showed multiple areas of atrophy. After her head trauma, she reported having minor difficulty in performing normal daily activities, including reading and verbal communication. She exhibited a mild degree of visual disturbance (corrected visual acuity; 20 / 30 in both eyes). Her optic disc showed mild cupping and cup to disc ratio asymmetry and an OCT revealed reduced RNFL thickness with an average thickness of 72 and 77 \u00b5m in the right and left eyes, respectively (). Because she had difficulty with VF-related tasks, assessment of her VF was unreliable despite repeated exams (). Her GCT map revealed a left homonymous vertical pattern of loss ().", "age": "[[38.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19224900': 1, '9479279': 1, '15914617': 1, '16226527': 1, '21917932': 1, '34368302': 2, '19834029': 1, '23474248': 1, '20631238': 1, '23395544': 1, '23018425': 1, '27728957': 1, '27327297': 1, '22131393': 1, '23084127': 1, '22473041': 1, '22182800': 1, '30105312': 1, '22247461': 1, '19427696': 1, '22562510': 1, '25120340': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4120352-1': 2, '4120352-2': 2, '4120352-3': 2, '8316943-1': 1, '8316943-2': 1}"}
