Clinical examination revealed a well-defined, nontender, ulcerated, nodular growth measuring approximately 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm on the lower lip vermilion []. Oral hygiene was fair.

The patients\u2019 medical, family and social history was noncontributory.\\nAn excisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia. Histopathological examination of H- and E-stained section revealed a hyperkeratotic, hyperplastic epithelium with parakeratin plugging in some areas. The underlying connective tissue stroma showed multiple areas of epithelial tissue entrapment with cystic degeneration in the center and keratinization [Figures and ]. Periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS)-stained section showed glycogen granules in the superficial epithelium. The epithelial proliferations in the connective tissue did not exhibit PAS positive glycogen granules though [].\\nThe lesion healed with no scarring over 5 weeks, but the patient was lost to follow-up later.", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19466263': 2, '14328045': 1, '24524559': 1, '31667065': 1, '14976535': 1, '25488010': 1, '16882696': 1, '26557626': 1, '2013902': 1, '29610614': 1, '8277007': 1, '16045778': 1, '23450313': 1, '13947459': 1, '21965859': 1, '13511305': 1, '28479697': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4399544-1': 1}"}
