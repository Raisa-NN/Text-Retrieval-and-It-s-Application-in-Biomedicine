He arrived in the emergency department unconscious and was intubated. After this, he had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation reversed with defibrillation. Repeated seizures were observed, and benzodiazepines were administered.\\nElectrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, prolonged PR and QTc interval (510 ms), widening of the QRS complex (200 ms), and increase in R wave amplitude in aVR (8.0 mV) and right ward of the terminal 40 ms (T40 ms) axis deviation in the frontal plane (210\u00b0), . Blood tests showed combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis (blood pH: 7.10) without other electrolytes disturbances.\\nGradual decreases in QRS duration (100 ms), in QTc interval (428 ms), in R wave amplitude in aVR (4.0 mV), and in the T40 ms axis deviation (150\u00b0) were observed after intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion in a dose of 250 mL \u00d7 8.4% and improved ventilation (blood pH: 7.40), .\\nToxicology screen was positive only for cocaine. Myocardial infarction and any structural cardiac involvement were ruled out because there was no electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemic injury, the dosage of troponin I was only slightly elevated, and the echocardiography was normal. He was discharged without neurological disabilities, and the electrocardiogram was normal.", "age": "[[19.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11590577': 1, '12232568': 1, '17283271': 1, '11484693': 1, '1850669': 1, '9258782': 1, '3706169': 1, '6316783': 1, '10452435': 1, '2155033': 1, '19031381': 1, '26159649': 1, '23762070': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
