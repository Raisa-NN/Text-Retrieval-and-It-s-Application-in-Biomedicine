He was symptomatic for fatigue and dyspnea. In his medical history he had arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and past episodes of seizures in treatment with oxcarbazepine.\\nThe echocardiographic exam showed: moderate depression of global left ventricular systolic function (38%), atrial enlargement and mild mitral regurgitation. The main laboratory tests (including hemochrome, coagulation, hepatic, renal and thyroid function) were normal. On the basis of a high thromboembolic risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score=4), an anticoagulant therapy with rivaroxaban, at the dose of 20 mg/day, was started.\\nAfter 6 weeks of treatment with rivaroxaban, in prevision of an EEC of AF, it was performed a TEE, which showed a thrombus in the left atrial appendage and low auricular flow rate ( and Video 1).\\nEEC was not performed and the anticoagulation therapy was empirically shifted from rivaroxaban to warfarin (with a therapeutic target of international normalized ratio of 2-3). A TEE was repeated after six more weeks and demonstrated the complete resolution of the thrombus.", "age": "[[68.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20802247': 1, '29593860': 1, '21382897': 1, '30571504': 1, '30504330': 1, '24576547': 1, '31686406': 1, '24766973': 1, '30581412': 1, '11346805': 1, '33595834': 1, '27614756': 1, '33808367': 1, '28875044': 2, '26664717': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5569874-1': 1}"}
