Physical examination showed a 5 \u00d7 5 cm rounded fixed mass on the right chest wall. Laboratory examinations were within normal limits. A chest radiograph and chest CT scan showed a soft-tissue density mass in the right rib cage with partial destruction of the fifth and sixth ribs and pleural effusion. No mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy was found. Pleural biopsy revealed a small cell tumor which stained negative for glycogen but immunocytochemically positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and CD99. T (11;22) research has not been carried out. The diagnosis of Askin\u2019s tumor was made. An abdominal CT scan did not show any metastatic localization. An isotope bone scan confirmed that no other skeletal site was involved. The tumor was classified as T2N0M0. After four cycles of chemotherapy of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, we observed a major clinical and radiological regression of the soft tissue mass. The primary tumor was resected, including the fifth and sixth ribs. Histology revealed residual microscopic tumor compatible with primitive neuroectodermal tumor. The patient received six courses of adjuvant chemotherapy. To date, she remains disease-free, with no evidence of recurrence after three years of follow-up.", "age": "[[27.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16702938': 1, '12579122': 1, '8685098': 1, '11435062': 1, '7955892': 1, '20399028': 1, '1203852': 1, '25884603': 1, '6083729': 1, '33013126': 1, '19692278': 1, '2551479': 1, '25714031': 1, '26870198': 1, '33868529': 1, '1310431': 1, '16572419': 1, '222426': 1, '23339634': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3556149-1': 2}"}
