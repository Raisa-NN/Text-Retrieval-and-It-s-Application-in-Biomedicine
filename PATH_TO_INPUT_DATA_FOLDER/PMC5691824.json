There was no previous similar history or abdominal surgery. She associated the onset of symptoms with a low energy fall on to her buttocks. There was no improvement despite hastening her elective caesarean section. Thereafter, she was treated as a post-operative ileus (Fig. ). On multiple examinations, she remained afebrile and haemodynamically stable. The abdomen was distended, with generalized mild tenderness. Bowel sounds were audible. Blood tests were unremarkable. Failure to progress prompted further evaluation with CT. This revealed a small bowel obstruction secondary to a right-sided diaphragmatic hernia (Fig. ). After resuscitation, she proceeded to laparoscopy.\\nA 10 mm port was inserted infraumbilically using Hasson technique, with an additional three operating ports. Laparoscopy confirmed radiological findings of a right-sided diaphragmatic defect with herniation of terminal ileum.\\nThere was evidence of small bowel obstruction, with distended small bowel loops and constriction at the defect. The defect\u2019s location did not appear consistent with a congenital hernia. The hernia was reduced by gentle traction and the defect was closed laparoscopically with interrupted 0-monosof sutures. The entire small bowel was viable and intact (Fig. ).\\nThe recovery was uncomplicated and the patient was discharged home 2 days postoperatively.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27512848': 1, '18751950': 1, '24113484': 1, '28212818': 1, '29230278': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
