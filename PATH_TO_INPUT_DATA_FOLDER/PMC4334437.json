The lips, gingivae palate, tongue, floor of the mouth, and buccal mucosa were clinically normal in appearance and there was no ulceration on the ventral surface of the tongue. A diagnosis of natal tooth was made based on the clinical presentation and confirmed by a periapical radiograph ().\\nAfter discussing the treatment options with the mother, it was decided that extraction was the best treatment since the mother was very concerned about the soreness of her breast and she felt she could not continue breastfeeding her child. Before extracting the natal tooth, a pediatrician was consulted and recommended that vitamin K (0.5\u20131.0 mg) to be given intramuscularly prior to the extraction to prevent potential hemorrhage.
