She had no history of symptoms from the urinary tract. During the preoperative staging, an abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan (256-slice SOMATOM\u00ae Definition Flash Multidetector Row CT system; Siemens Medical Solutions; Forchheim, Germany) revealed a U-shaped HSK. On contrast-enhanced CT, the HSK and its relation with the aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC) were carefully examined. The IVC was situated to the right side of the AA. It received the right renal vein before merging with the left renal vein to form the subhepatic IVC. There were asymmetric paired renal veins that drained the HSK. The CT images also revealed the left renal vein compression with proximal distention without the presence of collateral pathways between the superior mesenteric artery and the AA (fig. ). The HSK was vascularized by normally positioned small right and left RAs, and a significant aberrant RA originating from the distal AA (fig. ). The aberrant artery divided into two branches from a trunk, supplying the isthmus, lower lobes and middle portion of the HSK. The largest diameter of the main and aberrant RAs was measured within 5 mm of the ostium. The mean diameter of the right RA was 2.4 mm and of the left RA was 2.7 mm. The mean diameter of the aberrant RA was 5.8 mm.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'25607413': 1, '20639669': 1, '24178305': 1, '16374539': 1, '3172375': 1, '19172661': 1, '18477115': 1, '22890367': 1, '17865363': 1, '5794973': 1, '27304675': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
