Left pectoral site was prepared for implantation according to routine practice. Left subclavian puncture was performed successfully. But we could not advance the guidewire into the LBCV. Instead of getting into LBCV, the guidewire made a sharp turn and propagates downwards after subclavian vein. The repetitive attempts showed the same result. On cine venography, an accessory hemiazygos vein was seen which takes blood from LBCV and drains into azygos vein. Because of the challenging anatomy, we decided to make the implantation from the right side. And at the same session, we implanted DDD-R (Zephyr DR Saint Jude Medical, USA) permanent pacemaker by using the right subclavian vein, without difficulty.\\nThen we performed a multidetector thorax CT angiography to see real venous anatomy and accompanying defects clearly.\\nCT angiography (Figures and ) revealed that LBCV was draining into the accessory hemiazygos vein and this accessory hemiazygos vein was connecting with the hemiazygos at the level of tenth thoracic vertebrae and both were draining into left superior vena cava via azygos. Based on this identified anomaly the azygos system was dilated. And also CT angiography showed elongation and dilatation of the ascending aorta.", "age": "[[77.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'14928263': 1, '11301470': 1, '15100109': 1, '7817915': 1, '22291750': 1, '19638843': 1, '25505996': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
