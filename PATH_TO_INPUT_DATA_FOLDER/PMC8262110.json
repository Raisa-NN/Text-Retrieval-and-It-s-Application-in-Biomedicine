The pain was intermittent, nonradiating, unrelated to oral intake, and burning in nature with no alleviating or aggravating factors. Moreover, the patient reported weight loss without loss of appetite. He denied recent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, bowel habit changes, steatorrhea, history of recent travel, hiking, or contacts with other individuals with similar symptoms. On examination, no abdominal tenderness, distension, or masses were noted, and his bowel sounds were normal and heard in the four quadrants. Labs showed a hemoglobin level of 16.9 mg/dL and a total leukocyte count of 12,700/mm3. In addition, liver enzymes and kidney function tests were within normal limits. Stool antigen assays and nucleic amplification tests (NAATs) were deferred due to the absence of bowel habit changes. Helicobacter pylori stool antigen testing was negative. Upper endoscopy was performed and showed congestion of the duodenal mucosa (Figure ). Therefore, duodenal biopsies were obtained which showed numerous parasites featuring double nuclei compatible with G. lamblia around the intestinal villi (Figure ). The patient was treated with metronidazole as an outpatient with the resolution of symptoms over the following one month.", "age": "[[27.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27313261': 1, '15745082': 1, '30949313': 1, '12757177': 1, '11432808': 1, '28070825': 1, '11517624': 1, '33733914': 2, '11360222': 1, '24463773': 1, '29053792': 1, '17354120': 1, '18328567': 1, '34268030': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7983489-1': 1}"}
