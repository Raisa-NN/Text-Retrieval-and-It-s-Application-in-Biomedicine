The patient was diagnosed with unilateral sporadic RB, which had been manifested during his 2nd year of life. He had received multiple sessions of intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) with melphalan and topotecan. Because the RB tumor had not regressed, he had undergone enucleation of the left eye when he was 3 years old. Since then, he has been followed up with scheduled brain MRI for RB surveillance according to standard protocol. Despite the initial normal MRI reports, gradual descent of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum was reported in his MRI at a 4-year-old follow-up visit. The progression of CIM was confirmed by the radiologist in the last MRI, which was performed at 5 years of age []. There was no sign of CNS tumor, hydrocephalus, or CNS traumatic injury, and the patient did not have any history of intracranial surgery. Cervical spinal cord MRI was performed, and there was no pathologic finding, including syringomyelia. Neurological history and physical examination were performed by a neurosurgeon, where all findings were normal. The patient was followed up by neurology and neurosurgery service, and intracranial pressure has been reported to be normal following lumbar puncture analysis. Examination of his right eye was normal. The informed consent was obtained from the guardian.", "age": "[[5.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'14762679': 1, '1637670': 1, '3096099': 1, '9311732': 1, '22777404': 1, '17103432': 1, '16506501': 1, '21361762': 1, '18819932': 1, '17639419': 1, '28429052': 1, '34084963': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
