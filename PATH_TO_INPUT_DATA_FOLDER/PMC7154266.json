The patient got pregnant while on dasatinib, which mandated its immediate stoppage.\\nAlternatives were discussed with the patient: (1) to start with conventional interferon (safe and recommended); (2) to start with PEGylated interferon, but there is no data confirming its safety in pregnancy; (3) to take neither interferon nor TKIs, but this is a risky approach since the patient can progress to either an accelerated phase or blast crisis as a worst case scenario or remain in the chronic phase, which would be the best scenario, but this is not guaranteed. The patient and her husband opted for PEGylated interferon. She was referred to a high-risk pregnancy unit in the maternity hospital for close follow-up. Follow-up throughout pregnancy showed a normal fetus with no evidence of teratogenicity.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22200624': 1, '27352939': 1, '24174628': 1, '12569603': 1, '6192858': 1, '21175313': 1, '10355663': 1, '3457264': 1, '11698293': 1, '7504544': 1, '21685374': 1, '32308593': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
