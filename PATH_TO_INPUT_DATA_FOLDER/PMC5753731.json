She initially declined antimyeloma treatment but 6\u2005months later, following vertebral collapse at T5 and T12, started cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD) treatment. However, after a week, the patient was admitted with idiosyncratic syndrome including hyponatraemia, a fall in albumin and worsening of blood counts. She received red cell transfusion and her electrolyte abnormalities were carefully corrected.\\nAlthough there was evidence of a response to CTD (M-protein 34\u2005g/L), bortezomib and dexamethasone treatment was initiated as an alternative, but this was discontinued after three cycles due to progressive disease (M-protein 49\u2005g/L). The patient was then treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone with the aim of reducing disease burden prior to high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Treatment was frequently interrupted and dose adjusted to account for neutropenia and despite a minor response after six cycles (starting M-protein 47\u2005g/L, finishing M-protein 34\u2005g/L), in October 2009, she proceeded with stem cell mobilisation. However, neither cyclophosphamide nor plerixafor/GCSF priming were successful. A bone marrow biopsy revealed 50% myeloma cells and a course of CTD was restarted with cautious titration of thalidomide.\\nThe patient achieved a partial response with CTD retreatment over the course of 17 cycles (M-protein 13\u2005g/L) with no further episodes of idiosyncratic syndrome. However, attempts to harvest stem cells in February 2011 and again there months later, both failed. By then, her M-protein had risen to 24\u2005g/L and the patient was too neutropenic to be considered for a clinical trial.\\nAt this point, the patient began a daily regime of oral curcumin complexed with bioperine (to aid absorption), as a single dose of 8\u2005g each evening on an empty stomach. A few months later, she also embarked on a once-weekly course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (90\u2005min at 2 ATA) which she has maintained ever since. Her paraprotein levels gradually declined to a nadir of 13\u2005g/L, her blood counts steadily improved and there was no evidence of further progressive lytic bone disease.", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23910177': 1, '31619723': 1, '18662800': 1, '22473809': 1, '23143785': 1, '19372569': 1, '24157580': 1, '19110321': 1, '12393461': 1, '17975015': 1, '31717651': 1, '19737963': 1, '25517601': 1, '25789029': 1, '23803862': 1, '28413157': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
