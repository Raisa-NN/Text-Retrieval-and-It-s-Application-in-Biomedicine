She was also on triple inhaler therapy, theophylline and zafirlukast. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) was 1267 IU/ml, sweat chloride was positive, CFTR was negative, A. fumigatus antibodies were positive. Prolonged taper of OCS improved her symptoms and decreased IgE level to 463 IU/ml. However, further de-escalation of prednisone resulted in relapse of symptoms. Addition of voriconazole resulted in decrease in IgE, but prednisone reduction was still not achievable below 20 mg daily, and she developed steroid-induced myopathy. Omalizumab was added but it resulted in a hypersensitivity reaction. Dupilumab was initiated at a dose of 300 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks, which dramatically improved her symptoms and quality of life. IgE decreased to 79 at 4-month follow-up and she is now tapered to prednisone 5 mg on alternate days.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'29410215': 1, '34692397': 2, '27993289': 1, '26545165': 1, '24912986': 1, '27717223': 1, '33948179': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8512623-1': 1, '8512623-2': 1, '8512623-3': 1, '8512623-4': 1}"}
