On examination, she had no significant findings. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a linear, hyperdense, foreign body between the prepyloric region of the stomach and the pancreatic head. Although the foreign body had perforated the posterior wall of the prepyloric region of the stomach, the patient had no signs of peritonitis, since there was no communication between the gastric lumen and the peritoneal cavity. Emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed. The foreign body was safely removed laparoscopically and was identified as a 3-cm-long fishbone (Video ). Very few cases of an ingested fishbone that migrated into the pancreas have been published in the literature so far., The patient recovered without complications and was discharged. Laparoscopic surgery could be performed safely for the removal of an ingested foreign body embedded in the pancreas.", "age": "[[59.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'30594971': 2, '33768960': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6311171-1': 1}"}
