Patient had a history of tracheostomy, managed with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for two weeks. Post hospital discharge, within two weeks, patient started exertional breathlessness associated with dyspnea.\\nPatient was referred for lung function testing. The complete blood picture and biochemistry tests were normal. The lung function test parameters were recorded in sitting position without bronchodilator challenge. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in First Second (FEV1), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), Forced Expiratory Flow 50% (FEF-50%), Forced Expiratory Flow 75% (FEF-75%), and Maximum Mid Expiratory Flow (MMEF) were decreased, however, FEV1 /FVC ratio was within normal limit ().
