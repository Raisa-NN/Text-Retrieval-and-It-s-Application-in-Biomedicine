The pigmentation started in a small area on his calf and spread rapidly. His medical history was significant for uncontrolled type-two diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic back pain. Following a back surgery, the patient experienced an infected hematoma with S. aureus and suffered from recurrent S. aureus infections. As a result he was managed with 100 mg prophylactic minocycline twice daily for six years.\\nOn physical examination, blue-grey hyperpigmentation extended below the knees into a confluent patch over bilateral shins and dorsal surfaces of the feet (Figure ). Evaluation of the soles revealed heavy pigmentation in the non-dependent areas with complete sparing of weightbearing surfaces (Figure ). A perifollicular pigment distribution was noted near the proximal extensor aspect of his legs. No other areas of skin were involved including palms, body creases, or oral mucosa.\\nOn histopathology, the papillary and superficial reticular dermis contained pigment in perivascular macrophages and within dermal dendrocytes (Figure ). The complex pigment was positive with both the Perl's Prussian blue method for iron (Figure ) and the Fontana-Masson method for melanin (Figure ).\\nAfter discussion of the available treatment options, the patient opted not to pursue therapy given the intensity of pigmentation and his significant comorbidities.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18431092': 1, '836692': 1, '28785134': 1, '11705252': 1, '29381224': 1, '8733373': 1, '14723711': 1, '26835479': 1, '7249508': 1, '30050728': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
