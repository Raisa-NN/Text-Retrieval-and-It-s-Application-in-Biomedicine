There was a history of electric shock when a live 11 Kv electric transmission cable accidentally fell on his head 6 months back. This had resulted in burn injuries, alopecia with scarring on the scalp, and burn injuries in the neck region []. Burn injuries were managed in the \u201cDepartment of General Surgery\u201d of the university. The patient was visually asymptomatic till 3 months after the mishap when he noticed gradual fall in vision over the next 3 months. He presented to the Ophthalmology Outpatient Department, King George's Medical University with the visual acuity of perception of light with accurate projection of rays in all quadrants in both eyes. On anterior segment examination, the lids, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and pupil showed no abnormality, and there was bilateral total cataract []. Fundus was not visible at that time. B-scan showed no abnormality in both eyes []. The intraocular pressure in both eyes was within normal limits. Patient underwent lens aspiration with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in both eyes, under peribulbar anesthesia (with an interval of 1 week between both the operations). Intra- and postoperative period was uneventful. Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes, and fundus examination was within normal limits.", "age": "[[16.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'5057868': 1, '3866410': 1, '8694714': 1, '5057869': 1, '16693603': 1, '32174738': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
