Examination of oral cavity revealed an extensive and infiltrating mass at the base of the tongue. As the surgical removal of the mass was not possible due to its location and infiltrating appearance, on welfare grounds, the lynx was euthanized and submitted for post-mortem examination. A complete necropsy was performed and samples of tongue, right tonsil, right retropharyngeal lymph node, lungs, liver, kidneys, and brain were collected for laboratory exams.\\nSamples of collected organs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at 5 \u03bcm thick and stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (HE) for light microscopical observation.", "age": "[[15.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26711040': 1, '34212735': 2, '25724416': 1, '27236740': 1, '10501499': 1, '17984270': 1, '28735666': 1, '23122810': 1, '27487173': 1, '27771077': 1, '17430578': 1, '27010306': 1, '26965084': 1, '738954': 1, '28720294': 1, '2167986': 1, '25795095': 1, '29301274': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8252176-1': 1}"}
