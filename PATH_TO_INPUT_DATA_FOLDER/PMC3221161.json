The glans was conical and the glans groove was deep. There was no fan-shaped marker dorsally over the skin. The dorsal preputial hood was adequate in size and was seen as in usual cases of hypospadias.\\nThe surgical procedure was carried out under regional anesthesia with sedation. After catheterization of the meatus, circum\u2013coronal incision was taken and the penis was degloved up to the base of the penis. A tourniquet was applied and the artificial erection test was performed []. A transverse incision was taken distal to the meatus so as to mobilize the urethra with the spongiosum in a plane close to the corpora cavernosa []. The urethra was mobilized proximally till a point just proximal to maximum curvature. The excess length was excised just proximal to the neo-meatus at the level of the normal corpora spongiosa. Then, meatoplasty and glansplasty was performed. This was adequate enough to correct both dorsal chordee and hypospadias. Complete correction of the chordee was confirmed by repeating the artificial erection test []. An indwelling catheter was left in place and a nonocclusive dressing was applied. The dressing and the catheter were removed on the 10th day.\\nAt follow-up of 4 years, there was complete disappearance of dorsal chordee and the child was passing urine in a single stream from the tip of the penis.", "age": "[[10.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1185878': 1, '7411720': 1, '3327126': 1, '6857886': 1, '7206092': 1, '12371219': 1, '1557855': 1, '22121317': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
