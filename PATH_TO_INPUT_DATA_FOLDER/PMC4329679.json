In 2004, follow-up CT scans revealed two new lung malignancies in the right and left inferior lobes that were subsequently resected. In 2006 the patient again underwent surgery of two new nodules of the right inferior lobe and in 2008 for atypical resection of two malignancies of the right and left inferior lobes. In June 2012 a CT scan showed a new 20 mm pulmonary nodule in the dorsal segment of the right superior lobe, close to the surgical clips positioned during the previous surgical interventions. In July 2012, the patient was therefore referred to our Department of Interventional Radiology for evaluation for local ablative therapy. Cryoablation of the nodule was performed by means of one probe (Icesphere, Galil Medical, USA) placed into the lesion via a posterior CT-guided percutaneous approach. During the procedure, the augmented reality navigation system (SIRIO, MASMEC S.p.a, Modugno, BA, Italy) was used to ensure accurate placement of the probe. A CT scan at 3 months' follow-up [] and a PET CT scan at 6 months' follow-up showed dimensional reduction of the nodule and signs of central cavitation, indicating necrotic evolution of the area, coupled with a substantial reduction in SUV (3.8 vs. 9.9) and no signs of surgical clip misplacement.", "age": "[[38.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21508737': 1, '22147822': 1, '21833809': 1, '22265246': 1, '20656232': 1, '18546036': 1, '12760918': 1, '25709158': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4329679-1': 2, '4329679-2': 2}"}
