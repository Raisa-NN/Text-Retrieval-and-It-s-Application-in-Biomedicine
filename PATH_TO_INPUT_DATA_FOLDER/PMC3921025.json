DALK was performed in the right eye and subsequently performed 1 year later in the left eye following intolerance of contact lens wear. Intraoperatively, an Anwar big bubble was attempted in both eyes after initial manual lamellar dissection, but only a partial central bubble was obtained in both eyes. In the right eye especially, the full-thickness corneal scar due to previous hydrops prevented full extension of the big bubble to the trephination edge. Therefore, the donor cornea was prepared with a tapered edge to facilitate graft-host apposition as described above. The postoperative recovery was uneventful (see for visual outcome). The postoperative result shows excellent graft-host apposition on anterior segment ocular computed tomography (Visante, Zeiss, Munich, Germany; and ) The graft with the tapered ends matches the recipient bed with the peripheral rim of residual corneal stroma from incomplete corneal stroma removal.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20693553': 1, '16876513': 1, '9135380': 1, '12140020': 1, '10365042': 1, '17895417': 1, '9850251': 1, '15350322': 1, '19589495': 1, '15877089': 1, '11973386': 1, '11973083': 1, '10090362': 1, '24523576': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
