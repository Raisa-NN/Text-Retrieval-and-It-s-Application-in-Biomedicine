A severely melanin hyperpigmented gingiva was found at the labial surfaces of the maxillary arch (). The patient's medical history was noncontributory. One week after the surgery, gingiva presented slow epithelization with immature healing. The patient complained of mild pain in the maxillary gingival area. Two weeks after, the maxillary gingiva showed almost complete healing. One month after, the gingival color was significantly improved without recurrence or gingival recessions or deformities. The patient was satisfied with the esthetically improved gingival color.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26688932': 1, '28147333': 1, '9922763': 1, '546236': 1, '10884629': 1, '2098357': 1, '9868720': 1, '18062123': 1, '15529122': 1, '23291916': 1, '10711623': 1, '9161259': 1, '546235': 1, '8330948': 1, '20827330': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2931309-1': 2, '2931309-2': 2}"}
