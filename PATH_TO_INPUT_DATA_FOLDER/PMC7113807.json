She had undergone myomectomy and unilateral oophorectomy at another hospital 2 months previously. During the operation, a 10-cm myoma was seen along the broad ligament, and a tumor thrombus was found in the right ovarian vessels. The postoperative pathological examination confirmed IVL. Postoperative ultrasonography revealed no thrombus in the inferior vena cava. The patient presented to our department for the second-stage surgery with no symptoms. Vascular reconstruction CT showed a tumor in the inferior vena after a 2-month interval (). We performed total abdominal hysterectomy, left salpingo-oophorectomy, and tumor thrombectomy by angiotomy (). The intraoperative blood loss volume was about 2000 mL, and the pathologic examination confirmed IVL. The patient was clinically well at 2 months postoperatively.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'14743155': 1, '24191207': 2, '10788838': 1, '24371644': 1, '23384838': 1, '12527462': 1, '29699902': 1, '16583249': 1, '25425982': 1, '22419184': 1, '21777942': 1, '21854425': 1, '10805899': 1, '29351101': 1, '27631266': 1, '7675416': 1, '1203870': 1, '23563052': 1, '8112951': 1, '10027468': 1, '33327445': 1, '11904348': 1, '3202247': 1, '31937178': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7113807-1': 2, '7113807-2': 2, '3804365-1': 1}"}
