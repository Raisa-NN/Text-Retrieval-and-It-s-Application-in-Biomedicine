A physical examination revealed tenderness, swelling, and local heating on the posterior region of the right buttock and paresthesia on the posterolateral aspect of his right leg. Pyriformis and Patrick tests were positive, and laboratory findings showed elevated ESR (27 mm/hr) and CRP (12.6 mg/dl) with mild leukocytosis (10,600/UI). MRI was performed under the impression of septic arthritis of the hip, and revealed a boomerang-shaped fluid collection over the posterior surface of the ischium, and diffuse enhancement of the obturator internus tendon and inferior gemellus muscle (). An accompanying multidetector CT (MDCT) scan showed calcification along the obturator internus tendon (). His symptoms also completely resolved after 21 days of antibiotic treatment.", "age": "[[33.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15637479': 1, '12775849': 1, '21678093': 1, '26495246': 1, '12722916': 1, '8540628': 1, '12673818': 1, '10028081': 1, '11687692': 1, '11870443': 1, '8361917': 1, '18682677': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2627277-1': 2}"}
