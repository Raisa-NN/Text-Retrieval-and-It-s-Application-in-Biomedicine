She had a Snellen BCVA of 0.05 in her left eye and the hole diameter was 1581 micrometers prior to the surgery. As the first operation failed to close the FTMH, she had a second operation consisting of four ports pars plana approach for the application of a round button of PRF to the macular hole, followed by fluid-air and air-SF6 gas exchange. Three days strict face down positioning was ordered following the operation.\\nThe week after the application of PRF, the hole was shown to be closed on OCT (). The PRF button was slowly resorbed and the hole remained closed until the last visit at the fourth postoperative month. The Snellen BCVA improved from 0.05 to 0.2. The surgery and postoperative period was free of complications.", "age": "[[79.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16504852': 1, '31007241': 1, '10328392': 1, '31007240': 1, '31007238': 1, '21355018': 1, '2461136': 1, '21935606': 1, '11039421': 1, '7642336': 1, '26742873': 1, '9730174': 1, '2591594': 1, '23626459': 1, '11013203': 1, '15492625': 1, '2466319': 1, '19187989': 1, '11371086': 1, '31781448': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6875262-1': 2}"}
