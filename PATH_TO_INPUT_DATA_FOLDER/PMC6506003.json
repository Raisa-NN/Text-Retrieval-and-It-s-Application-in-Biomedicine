The pain was responsive to common analgesics, and no triggering factors were detected. The patient had normal cognitive development for his age. A left temporal Galassi type II arachnoid cyst () was diagnosed, and elective endoscopic surgery was planned; MRI of the brain was performed for surgical planning.\\nThe patient suffered a mild TBI during a football match due to a head collision, without loss of consciousness or other signs of severity during the acute trauma phase. The headache intensified (VAS=8) 30 days after the event, becoming continuous and refractory to analgesia and associated with vomiting and double vision.\\nOn neurological examination, the patient had Glasgow score of 15, with no pupillary, language or motor changes but with left lateral rectus muscle paresis. MRI of the brain revealed a haemorrhage in the Galassi type III left temporal arachnoid cyst and an ipsilateral subdural haematoma ().\\nThe child was hospitalised as an emergency case for microsurgery. Left pterional craniotomy, haematoma drainage and microsurgical fenestration of the arachnoid cyst, creating a communication with the interpeduncular cistern, were performed ().", "age": "[[8.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'7434187': 1, '25769260': 1, '33489638': 2, '1430458': 1, '16601941': 1, '23313978': 1, '22383163': 1, '29091255': 1, '31040140': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7813954-1': 1}"}
