He was receiving treatment for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. His medical history included a saphenous stripping for varicose veins. On admission, he had no clinical symptoms. Regarding laboratory findings, his hemoglobin was 12.6 g/dL and hematocrit was 37.3%. Colonoscopy revealed a 2.0-cm-long pedunculated polyp overlaid by hyperemic mucosa in the proximal sigmoid colon []. EMR using the inject-and-cut technique was performed, and the polyp was resected en bloc. Microscopic examination of the polyp demonstrated dilated blood vessels with thickened, hypertrophic walls []. This was compatible with AVM with a polypoid appearance. No immediate or delayed bleeding was noted after polypectomy.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'300063': 1, '19399283': 2, '20485622': 1, '31616719': 1, '8389094': 1, '2440788': 1, '1083228': 1, '24012558': 1, '31832468': 1, '23623874': 1, '34815980': 1, '15235876': 1, '25505727': 2, '31559332': 1, '28139503': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5329980-1': 2, '2672141-1': 1, '4260109-1': 1}"}
