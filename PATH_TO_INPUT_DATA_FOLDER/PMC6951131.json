The protrusion was progressive and associated with pain. On examination, the right eye had no perception of light. There was proptosis of around 4 mm with chemosis of conjunctiva and the extraocular movements were completely restricted in all direction of gazes []. Exposure keratopathy precluded a fundus evaluation, and no thrill or bruit was noted. The left eye was otherwise normal. Patient had already got a computed tomography (CT) scan done which was suggestive of diffuse right-sided orbital edema, thickened extraocular muscles, and fracture floor of right orbit along with fracture of right frontal sinus. [] Patient was diagnosed with posttraumatic orbital cellulitis elsewhere and was advised systemic antibiotics. Patient however did not follow the advice and consulted us for a second opinion.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23961028': 1, '17279529': 1, '25741093': 1, '31856456': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
