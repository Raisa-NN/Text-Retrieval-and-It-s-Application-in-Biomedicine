She was on vigabatrin 1,500 mg for her recurrent myoclonic seizures (2\u20133 times/month) throughout her childhood. Her medical records stated intermittent auditory hallucinations during that period. At the age of 13 years, the patient stopped her antiepileptic against medical recommendation. Following a seizure relapse at the age of 16 years, her electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed relatively frequent left occipital spikes. Topiramate 200 mg was started, but she again discontinued it arbitrarily after five months.\\nFacial angiofibromas developed at the age of 11 years. Although her facial skin lesions became barely noticeable after multiple chemical skin peelings and laser therapies, she was continuously distressed with her appearance. To treat her depressed mood and social withdrawal, the patient received sertraline 50 mg and pimozide 1mg at a private practice. Viewing that she was not fully responsive to the treatment, she visited our psychiatric outpatient department at Seoul St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Catholic University of Korea.\\nA brain magnetic resonance imaging, ordered at her first visit, showed multiple non-enhancing cortical tubers and calcifications in both lateral ventricles suggesting subependymal nodules (). The intelligence test revealed borderline intellectual functioning (full-scale intelligence quotient [IQ], 77; verbal IQ, 83; performance IQ, 73).\\nDiagnosed with psychotic depression, venlafaxine 75 mg and risperidone 1 mg were started. After one month, risperidone was discontinued and venlafaxine was increased to 150 mg as the mood improved. Due to hypomanic features emerged at month 3, venlafaxine was discontinued and valproate 300 mg was added. She displayed somewhat mixed features in mood with 2 months of further treatment. Eventually, loss of follow up occurred before she was hospitalized by her parents. The parents reported hallucinatory behaviors like silly smile and self-talking and their main complaints were irritability and neglect of self-care. The patient\u2019s refusal for foods prepared by her mother hinted presence of possible paranoid delusions.\\nIn contrast, the chief complaint of the patient was depressed mood. Her thought process was relatively relevant and coherent. The thought contents were dissatisfaction and preoccupation with her appearance, and feelings of worthlessness. Persecutory delusions and delusions of reference were also displayed. Any forms of hallucinations were denied despite the reported history of hallucinatory behaviors.\\nWhile no other laboratory tests showed abnormality, the urine pregnancy test at the admission was tested positive. After obstetric consultation, the false-positivity of the initial screening was confirmed. During the 5 days of drug-free period in ruling out pregnancy, worsening of manic symptoms occurred with the emergence of talkativeness and flight of ideas.\\nAs pregnancy was ruled out, aripiprazole 5 mg and valproate 600 mg were started. While increasing aripiprazole and valproate doses to 15 mg and 800 mg respectively, she began to complain akathisia. Propranolol was added for akathisia control. After one week of inpatient treatment, the manic symptoms improved but psychomotor retardation worsened and sudden weight gain of 3 kg occurred. To alleviate the aforementioned side effects, valproate was switched to lamotrigine. An EEG performed at the time of the switch showed no epileptiform discharges.\\nHowever, the manic symptoms worsened again after 2 days of valproate discontinuation. Due to her aggravated hostility, regular visit by family members had to be stopped. The patient also admitted auditory hallucinations of criticizing nature. Aripiprazole was increased to 20 mg. Subsequently, the patient\u2019s mood and auditory hallucination were improved, but the persecutory delusions persisted. While increasing lamotrigine as scheduled, aripiprazole was increased to 30 mg ().\\nDuring the admission, the patient repeatedly displayed negative perception of herself and others. Altogether with inefficient social skills, they were evaluated as contributing factors to her mood symptoms and paranoia. Therefore, brief cognitive therapy was carried out to improve the distorted self-images in addition to pharmacotherapy. Consequently, the patient\u2019s interactions with her family improved. After two successful overnight stay trials at home, she was finally discharged on 50th hospital day. The patient is now being followed up in the out-patients department for over 4 years without exacerbation, currently maintaining aripiprazole 15 mg and lamotrigine 200 mg.\\nThe institutional review board of the hospital approved this report after reviewing that no identifiable personal data were used and checking the presence of consent.
