He did not have any fever or dyspnea. He underwent VP shunt procedure with a medium-pressure flexible shunt and repair of dorsal meningocele at 1 month of age and was doing well till date. He was followed up at our OPD every 6 months and was asymptomatic. Clinically, the VP shunt chamber could be palpated in the neck as it was shifted down. His vitals were stable, chest was clear, abdomen was soft, and there was no neurological deficit. His weight gain and height was appropriate for age.\\nRoutine blood investigations and chest X-ray were carried out. Blood reports of complete blood count and electrolytes were normal. The anteroposterior (AP) and lateral view of chest X-ray revealed supradiaphragmatic coiling of VP shunt in the right side of chest wall. There was no pleural effusion or hydrothorax []. Non contrast CT scan (NCCT) thorax was carried out to confirm migration of the VP shunt in the thoracic cavity []. NCCT of brain revealed downward migration of VP shunt outside lateral ventricle.\\nInitially, a neck incision was made to retrieve the shunt; however, because of failed attempt, video-assisted thoracoscopic removal of shunt was carried out and it was retrieved totally.", "age": "[[6.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'2426622': 1, '18637179': 2, '17406044': 1, '8121558': 1, '7792702': 1, '18382988': 1, '19263369': 1, '30271474': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2490671-1': 1}"}
