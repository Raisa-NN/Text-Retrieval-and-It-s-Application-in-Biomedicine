The vomitus was large volume, nonbilious, and containing semidigested food. There was no history of significant weight loss or gastrointestinal bleed. Examination was unremarkable other than mild dehydration and a distended stomach with succussion splash. A nasogastric tube drained 1.2 liters of gastric content. Endoscopy revealed a grossly dilated stomach with an impassable pyloric stenosis but no mass lesion. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen concurred with endoscopy and biopsy confirmed absence of malignancy (). With a diagnosis of peptic pyloric stricture, the patient was optimized and taken up for antrectomy and truncal vagotomy. There was an intense fibrosis distorting pyloro-duodenum, which on dividing extruded bile. Further examination and probing revealed an inadvertent division of both bile and pancreatic ducts (). The pancreatic head was atrophic, and there was an anomalous union of pancreatic duct on bile duct (P-B type). In view of the above, pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) was performed, which took 270 minutes and entailed a blood loss of 280 ml. Postoperative periods were uneventful, and he was discharged on day 12. The histopathological report confirmed benign peptic stricture, and the patient is doing well at 16 months follow-up.", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19725297': 1, '13545759': 1, '29340550': 1, '24944503': 1, '31641837': 1, '22696905': 1, '25070690': 1, '17571173': 1, '33123403': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
