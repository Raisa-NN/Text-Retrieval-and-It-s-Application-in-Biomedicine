The left lung mass was found by CT scan 3 months ago (). CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of the lung mass proved adenocarcinoma, and the gene detection showed that a deletion mutation in the exon 19 of the EGFR and the ALK rearrangement was negative. She also received bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg), cisplatin (75 mg/m2), and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) administered every 3 weeks. During the treatment, digestive tract reaction and myelotoxicity were also well tolerated. Chest CT showed significant shrinkage of the major lung nodule after two cycles of therapy (). Similarly, after four cycles of therapy, the major lung nodule showed further shrinkage as seen from CT scan (). The expression of carcinoembryonic antigen was also reduced progressively in the course of treatment ().", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15550583': 1, '20650686': 1, '17079694': 1, '25276156': 1, '11784875': 1, '19344286': 1, '15310767': 1, '19188680': 1, '17167137': 1, '22244743': 1, '21296855': 1, '25274031': 1, '14745444': 1, '12778130': 1, '17602060': 1, '12516033': 1, '14570950': 1, '29318404': 2, '23690447': 1, '22364783': 1, '23835708': 1, '26137109': 1, '18506025': 1, '19887966': 1, '21336183': 1, '19349493': 1, '26014294': 1, '27555784': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4968850-1': 2, '4968850-2': 2, '5760484-1': 1}"}
