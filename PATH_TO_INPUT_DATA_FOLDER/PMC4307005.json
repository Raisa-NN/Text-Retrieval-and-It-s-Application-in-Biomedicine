She had noticed mild pruritic sensations of the nose 1 year earlier, and the dorsal area of the nose had then swollen gradually without any other symptoms. She had a history of rhinoplasty with silicone implant approximately 50 years earlier.\\nUpon physical examination, we found a subcutaneous mass, 15 \u00d7 5 mm in size, at the dorsal nasal area (fig. ). The mass was elastic-hard without tenderness. A superficial ultrasound test showed a well-circumscribed subcutaneous mass with post-acoustic shadow, which indicated calcification therein (fig. ). X-ray and ultrasound tests showed a high-intensity plate over the dorsal nasal area (fig. ), indicating the silicone plate placed in her nose. Based on the clinical manifestation, the differential diagnosis included calcinosis cutis, calcifying epithelioma, foreign body granuloma and subcutaneous tumors.\\nTo confirm a diagnosis, we took a skin biopsy. A white, gruel-like, semiliquid material seeped out and solidified shortly thereafter. Histological analysis of this white gruel-like semiliquid material confirmed calcified deposits and fibrosis (fig. ). There were no foreign body giant cells or malignant cells. From the above findings, we considered the calcified deposits to be a possible result of rhinoplasty using silicone.", "age": "[[72.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11214050': 1, '18090765': 1, '22073082': 1, '8024400': 1, '11310837': 1, '25685132': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
