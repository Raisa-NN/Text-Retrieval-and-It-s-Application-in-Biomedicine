On examination, there was a single, well-defined, mobile, relatively hard mass, with normal surrounding skin and mucosa ().\\nComputed tomographic scan showed an elliptically shaped smooth mass of fat density measuring 2\u00d71.5 cm with partial ossification. The mass was not in contact with the mandible, and a clinical diagnosis of lipoma with calculus was made ().\\nUnder local anesthesia, the tumor with no adhesions to the periosteum of the mandible was easily dissected through the intraoral incision. Gross examination showed a whitish, partially yellowish mass measuring 2\u00d71.5\u00d71.5 cm, with a well-circumscribed smooth surface (). Histological examination showed that the tumor was mostly composed of mature adipose tissue with partially osseous and cartilaginous differentiation. No atypical cells or mitotic figures were observed. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor was positive for CD34. On the basis of these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as an osteochondrolipoma (). Six months after surgery, there was no recurrence of the disease.", "age": "[[72.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24137417': 1, '14578098': 1, '15472660': 1, '2657678': 1, '9151169': 1, '22923905': 2, '12539029': 1, '1506960': 1, '23311255': 1, '22660950': 1, '32551176': 1, '34817377': 2, '16979520': 1, '22471304': 1, '31949874': 1, '26217476': 2, '22623084': 1, '25243049': 1, '20309407': 1, '6670522': 1, '11304456': 1, '29238440': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8612129-1': 1, '3424949-1': 1, '4515470-1': 1}"}
