There were observed an increase of IOP to 41.0 mm Hg and progression in the visual field (MD=\u22124.23). No contact of the implant with the endothelium was observed. Collagen-rich connective tissue in the implant channels and dispersed chronic inflammatory infiltrations both around and inside the implant were detected. Lymphocytic infiltration (LCA+) was accompanied with clusters of numerous polynuclear giant cells ().", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31413822': 1, '31568666': 1, '20805134': 1, '21873316': 1, '25624673': 1, '26175960': 1, '22249233': 1, '27253968': 1, '2914753': 1, '21861086': 1, '19273788': 1, '28900712': 1, '28600745': 1, '25246758': 1, '34127842': 1, '27051320': 2, '23867717': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3806560-1': 2, '3806560-2': 2, '3806560-3': 2, '4807951-1': 1}"}
