MRI revealed a left parietal convexity tumor. Excisional biopsy revealed a clear-cell variant of meningioma (WHO Grade II) showing marked pleomorphism with some binucleated cells and multinucleated giant cells. Scattered tiny foci of necrosis were present. Intervening blocky perivascular and interstitial collagen were seen. Occasional mitoses were noted (<4/10 hpf). Focal collagenous rosettes and fibrosclerotic whorls were seen which were highlighted by Masson's trichrome stain. Tumor cells showed EMA and vimentin positivity. Focally, tumor was seen infiltrating the cerebral parenchyma [Figures \u2013].", "age": "[[75.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'3005518': 1, '1384270': 1, '4013675': 1, '26106026': 1, '26976982': 1, '17618441': 1, '31143285': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6516015-1': 2, '6516015-2': 2}"}
