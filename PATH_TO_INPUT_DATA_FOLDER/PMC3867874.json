At clinical examination, we found that one lens had microopacities. HFE gene analyses were negative for known mutations. Further genetic investigation showed that the patient was heterozygous for the IRE C29G mutation of the L-ferritin gene [].\\nFamily history showed that the patient's father and a 12-year old sister were healthy. A 14-year old sister was affected by generalized cataract and very high ferritin levels (1,796 ng/dL). His mother also had cataract associated with high ferritin levels (744 ng/dL) and was negative for HFE gene mutations, while MRI detected an iron overload in the spleen. Diagnosis showed HH, but phlebotomy led to severe anaemia and was definitively suspended after only two sessions. Further genetic investigation showed that not only the patient but also his mother and his 14-year-old sister were all heterozygous for the IRE C29G mutation of the L-ferritin gene (). A watch-and-wait approach was adopted for all three while awaiting cataract surgery. shows progression of cataract in the left eye of the child from 2008 to 2011 (: 2008; : 2010; : 2011), bilateral cataract in the right eye and in the left eye of the 14-year-old sister and cataract in the mother's eye .", "age": "[[7.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12210292': 1, '12730114': 1, '12920121': 1, '12416730': 1, '16146431': 1, '14662596': 1, '8696333': 1, '15223007': 1, '10383191': 1, '16186329': 1, '12547247': 1, '24368960': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
