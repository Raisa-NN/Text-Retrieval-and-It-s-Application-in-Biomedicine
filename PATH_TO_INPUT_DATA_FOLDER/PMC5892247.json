He was initially a bilateral hearing aid user but subsequently stopped using his hearing aid in the left ear several years prior due to experiencing progressive audiometric decline. Audiometric testing confirmed profound SNHL in the left ear, while the right ear exhibited moderate-to-severe SNHL. Information regarding the subtype of his CMT is unavailable at our tertiary care facility; prior workup was performed at another institution.\\nLeft-sided cochlear implantation was performed using a conventional length lateral wall electrode. The electrodes were introduced without resistance, and a full insertion was achieved using the MED-EL\u2122 Synchrony Flex\u00ae 28 cochlear implant. Intraoperative device testing found normal impedance levels throughout the array; however, electrically evoked auditory potentials were absent on all electrodes. Upon initial activation 3 weeks after surgery, the patient reported excellent access to sound in the cochlear implant-only condition. He has made good progress at each subsequent visit; speech perception testing after seven months showed improvement from 0% preoperatively to 32% on AzBio sentence and 53% on CNC phoneme testing in the cochlear implant-only condition. At an 18-month phone follow-up, he reports improving subjective benefit and consistent usage of the device.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31393079': 1, '3471036': 1, '15057660': 1, '31336816': 1, '10599857': 1, '22333975': 1, '26065403': 1, '16772060': 1, '12578939': 1, '33136025': 1, '22664900': 1, '29780422': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
