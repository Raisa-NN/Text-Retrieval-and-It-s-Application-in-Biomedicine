On digital examination, a firm, round-shaped, rubbery-textured mass was palpated at the anterior wall of the rectum 2 cm from the anal verge. The mass was adhesive to the prostate, but not to the pelvic floor. Computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis showed a mass 45 mm in diameter between the anterior wall of the lower rectum and prostate (Figure A,B and image not shown, respectively). Colonoscopy showed a submucosal mass with a shallow depression in the center just above the dentate line. Fine needle biopsy revealed bundles of spindle-like cells, with 5 mitotic cells per 50 high-power fields, and a Ki-67 (MIB-1) labeling index of 5 to 8%. The tumor was both CD34-positive and c-kit-positive (Figure ), which suggested a GIST.He had a medical history of diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia with severe coronary artery calcification, which was detected by a chest CT scan. He performed a treadmill exercise stress test, the results of which indicated comorbid ischemic heart disease. Coronary angiography (CAG) was also performed, and revealed multiple coronary artery stenoses; 75 to 90% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD; Figure A) and 90% stenosis in the left circumflex artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed using a drug-eluting stent (Endeavor; Medtronic Cardiovascular Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA) for the LAD lesion.The patient subsequently administered imatinib (400 mg daily), aspirin (100 mg daily), and clopidogrel (75 mg daily) orally. Follow-up CAG showed excellent patency at the stenting site and no obvious change in other segments 6 months after the coronary intervention (Figure B). Meanwhile, follow-up image studies showed that the tumor was gradually decreasing in size. A final evaluation revealed a 24 mm mass between the rectum and prostate (Figure C,D), which appeared to provide an adequate surgical margin for anal sphincter-sparing surgery after 12 months of imatinib treatment. The patient did not exhibit either imatinib- or anti-coagulant-related adverse events.\\nLaparoscopic low anterior resection with diverting ileostomy was performed after a week preoperative imatinib-free interval. The patient exhibited urinary retention and ileus shortly after surgery, both of which were ameliorated conservatively, and no postoperative cardiac event was noted. Histopathological examinations revealed that CD34-positive spindle-shaped eosinophilic tumor cells spread from the muscularis propria to the adventitia with marked hyalinization (image not shown). The tumor was diagnosed as a GIST of low-grade malignancy due to the negligible number of mitotic cells per 50 high-power fields. Surgical margins were proven clear of viable tumor cells. The patient remains free of recurrence 1 year after surgery without adjuvant chemotherapy.", "age": "[[74.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21040362': 1, '22129582': 1, '10649261': 1, '22942798': 1, '14645423': 1, '30098596': 2, '19110398': 1, '30443673': 1, '18239881': 1, '16957966': 1, '15284260': 1, '27279404': 2, '18076015': 1, '22221949': 1, '18953611': 1, '17681780': 1, '21353100': 1, '24018650': 1, '15451219': 1, '23084087': 1, '22965573': 1, '26957123': 2, '26672673': 1, '34434430': 2, '20555113': 1, '22294424': 1, '25022862': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4782511-1': 1, '4916759-1': 1, '8383608-1': 1, '6087008-1': 1}"}
