He had also sustained severe popliteal artery injury and a patellar fracture. After arterial repair and establishment of limb perfusion, he was referred for repair of the tissue defect in the left popliteal region. Physical examination revealed a 5 \u00d7 5 cm defect on the midline of the left popliteal fossa. The wound was necrotic, but no arteries or nerves were exposed. Daily dressing changes were performed. Following wound bed preparation, reconstruction was planned. The operation was performed under spinal anesthesia. The defect was covered with a 45\u00b0-angled random-pattern bilobed flap (primary lobe measured 9 \u00d7 6 cm, and secondary lobe measured 9 \u00d7 3 cm) () and two Penrose drains were placed (). The patient was followed up for 3 months. No complications occurred, including infection, dehiscence, or flap loss. Healing progressed uneventfully and he had no difficulties sitting, standing, or walking ().", "age": "[[26.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9950571': 1, '17116788': 1, '10925186': 1, '23880013': 1, '11484532': 1, '15468393': 1, '30428437': 1, '8274252': 1, '2742390': 1, '23851856': 1, '17255668': 1, '24346926': 2, '17901741': 1, '19568069': 1, '13064040': 1, '27252948': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3875974-1': 1}"}
