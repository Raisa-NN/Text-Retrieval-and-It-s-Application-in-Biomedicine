He had mild bilateral ptosis, proximal weakness, areflexia, and normal sensation. He was diagnosed with GBS in another hospital. On review, the reflexes were noted to improve with exercise. NCS showed reduced distal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes that increased after short (10 s) exercise test and decreased during 3-Hertz repetitive nerve stimulation test. He was diagnosed with Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody was present. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed left lung suprahilar mass which on biopsy revealed small cell carcinoma. He was treated with plasma exchange and 3,4-diaminopyridine. He also received chemotherapy and radiotherapy for small cell lung carcinoma. His weakness improved after 6 months.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20600491': 1, '2194422': 1, '25640907': 1, '24616124': 1, '10842280': 1, '12847079': 1, '22694000': 1, '25072194': 1, '12439896': 1, '23804237': 1, '29761013': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5943729-1': 2, '5943729-2': 2, '5943729-3': 2, '5943729-4': 2, '5943729-5': 2, '5943729-6': 2, '5943729-7': 2, '5943729-8': 2, '5943729-9': 2, '5943729-10': 2}"}
