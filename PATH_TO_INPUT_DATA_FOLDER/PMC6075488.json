The patient presented with mild, right eye pain one hour after glass was sustained to the face during a motor vehicle collision. Visual acuity was 20/100 (baseline 20/20), but no obvious facial or ocular trauma was noted. Extraocular movements were intact. Slit lamp examination revealed a central stellate corneal laceration, peaked 4mm non-reactive pupil, flat anterior chamber, and a falsely negative Seidel sign (). Intraocular pressure was not measured given the nature of the injury. Computed tomography (CT) orbits revealed a flat anterior chamber (). The patient was placed in an eye shield, treated for nausea/pain, initiated on antibiotics with levofloxacin, and updated on tetanus; ophthalmology then completed a surgical repair.", "age": "[[31.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24511795': 1, '31701275': 1, '23961028': 1, '22245950': 1, '24418441': 1, '30083651': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
