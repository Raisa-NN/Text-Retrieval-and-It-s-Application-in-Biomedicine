On admission, the child was in a poor condition, afebrile, and alert but rather flaccid. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was done. CSF parameters showed high white blood cell (WBC) count 110 cell/mm3, low glucose level 39 mg/dl, and high protein 227/dl. The CSF sample was obtained for culture. The tip of the abdominal catheter was protruded from the urethra. The patient underwent plain X-rays of cranium, thorax and abdomen, cerebral, and abdominal CT scan. Abdominal X-ray showed an abnormal distal location of catheter distal tip []. Cranial CT scan showed overdrainage of ventricles. Laparotomy, performed jointly by neurosurgeons and pediatric surgeons, exposed the catheter and removed it and repaired the bladder. After the entire shunt system was removed, antibiotic treatment was administered for 2 weeks. Under treatment with antibiotics the child showed clinical improvement and progressive normalization of the CSF parameters, and a new VP shunt was placed. The postoperative course was uneventful.", "age": "[[5.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21735369': 1, '21887187': 1, '21887195': 2, '9621354': 1, '29122895': 1, '27469457': 1, '20108757': 1, '30271479': 1, '22004629': 1, '19096671': 1, '22069421': 1, '19618312': 1, '20708840': 1, '7632369': 1, '22222434': 1, '21887196': 2, '22194137': 1, '10358988': 1, '28553396': 2, '8241787': 1, '12232559': 1, '18382988': 1, '22069434': 1, '23248688': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3162780-1': 1, '3162779-1': 1, '5437805-1': 1}"}
