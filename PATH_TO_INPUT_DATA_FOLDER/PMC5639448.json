This revealed a well-defined intrathoracic mass, abutting the left hemidiaphragm. Subsequently, a CT study was arranged to further characterize the finding []. This revealed a kidney within the posterior mediastinum, above a normal left hemidiaphragm. Detailed past medical history revealed normal physiological and age-specific milestones, with no developmental anomalies. Therefore, the patient was referred to our Nuclear Medicine Department for a 99mTc-MAG3 study to assess the renal function and handling of tracer in the ectopic kidney.\\nAfter weight measurements, 21MBq of 99mTc-MAG-3 and 8.2 mg of furosemide were administered through a cannula at the start of dynamic imaging (time-0). Dynamic image acquisition was undertaken at a rate of 20 s per frame for 30 min (90 frames in total). The data were analyzed using the GE Discovery Xeleris view 3 functional imaging workstation software (Medical systems Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 2000).", "age": "[[6.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11105630': 1, '10750971': 1, '7705132': 1, '3288769': 1, '11465206': 1, '25538492': 2, '29033680': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4262879-1': 1}"}
