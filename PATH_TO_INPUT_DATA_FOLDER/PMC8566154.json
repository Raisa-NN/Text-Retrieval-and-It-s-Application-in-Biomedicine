Laboratory assessment indicated elevated liver function tests (ALAT 539 U/L) as well as minor increases in pancreatic enzymes (lipase 399 U/L), suggestive of mild biliary pancreatitis. The patient underwent urgent same-session endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in a left lateral position. EUS indicated prepapillary impaction of an estimated 5-mm stone (). After difficult biliary access on wire-guided cannulation due to a sharp bile duct axis and unstable scope position, we opted for early \u201cbottom-up\u201d needle knife access. However, simulation of cuts likewise indicated an awkward angle for controlled superficial incisions (). In consideration of the impacted stone, providing a certain safety plane, we applied an as-yet unreported technique designated the \u201clever technique,\u201d involving ultranear-view instrumentation and directing cuts exclusively through moving the large dial, navigating scope and needle knife as one piece. This resulted in an immediate transmural opening of the common bile duct with a black pigment stone visualized (; suppl. Video). The procedure was terminated without complications after wire-guided extensional papillotomy and subsequent stone extraction ().", "age": "[[24.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'33374902': 1, '27299638': 1, '29761150': 1, '34786363': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
