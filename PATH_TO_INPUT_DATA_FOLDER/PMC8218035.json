After its recurrence 2 years later, she presented to dermatology clinic where shave biopsy revealed stage III melanoma with at least 1.8-mm infiltration and ulceration. A surgical oncologist performed wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy, ultimately positive for malignant involvement. On staging PET/CT, inflammatory post-operative changes were identified along the anterior aspect of the left shin in addition to a hypermetabolic focus in the T9 vertebral body without correlating CT features. Further evaluation with MRI showed ill-defined focus of T9 vertebral bone marrow signal changes without discrete margins. PET/CT-guided biopsy of the 18F-FDG-avid region of the T9 vertebral body revealed no findings to suggest malignancy (Image ). These findings correlated with a traumatic injury of her lumbar spine 5 years prior. Treatment with mivolumab was initiated, and surveillance imaging had not yet been obtained at the time of this review.", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'25106463': 1, '21325361': 1, '27321036': 1, '28026209': 1, '28504563': 1, '26590444': 1, '20680270': 1, '34181113': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8218035-1': 2, '8218035-2': 2, '8218035-3': 2}"}
