Past medical history was remarkable for atrial septal defect closure at the age of ten, but no previous abdominal surgeries or trauma. Patient did not smoke, drink alcohol or took any medication. During the physical examination, inspection showed a tattoo on the right side of the umbilicus (Fig. A); palpation at the same level revealed a painless and firm mass of 5 \u00d7 4 cm2 approximately, with not easily definable edges. Ultrasonography showed a 4 cm2 mass with no clear margins. Abdominal magnetic resonance (MRI) was subsequently performed describing a 17 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 50 mm3 mass confined into the rectus abdominis (Fig. A and B). Needle biopsy samples were taken, and pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of a desmoid tumour.\\nThe surgery for the mass removal was performed under general anaesthesia and the incision was placed in the upper edge of the tattoo, just above the tumour localization (Fig. ). A segment of 7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 cm3 was resected from the rectus abdominis. Abdominal wall was subsequently reconstructed with primary fascial closure reinforced with underlay polypropylene mesh. Local bupivacaine infusion catheter was placed for pain control []. Abdominal suture was carried out in three layers abdominal fascia using Vicryl 3-0 for abdominal fascia and dermis, and skin with single stiches prolene 4-0 (Fig. B). Wound healing was uneventful and the specimen confirmed a desmoid tumour, without mitotic or necrotic features, radically excised. At three months follow-up the scar was difficult to notice because of the tattoo. At 2-year follow-up, the patient was satisfied with his tattoo scar, while no tumour recurrence revealed by MRI, either abdominal hernia nor bulging could be detectable (Fig. B).", "age": "[[37.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23627560': 1, '21461628': 1, '26488844': 1, '25120377': 1, '22177648': 1, '20023460': 1, '26742545': 1, '26640082': 1, '26724176': 1, '18437475': 1, '29657707': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
