Of note, the patient was asymptomatic from this effusion (). The patient\u2019s last infusion using the HAIPC occurred on November 2019.\\nSince the placement of his HAIPC, the patient had two right-sided thoracentesis demonstrating transudate fluid (). The patient had multiple interrogations of his HAIP including a Nuclear Medicine Hepatic Pump w/SPECT/CT () and an IR Venogram (), demonstrating adequate position and functioning of the HAIP with perfusion of the liver and no extrahepatic radiotracer. Of note, the patient\u2019s labs pre-operatively were all within normal limits, including normal biliary labs (AST/ALT 23/15, AP 55 and T bili .3).\\nOn 20 December 2019, the patient underwent a right-side video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, with pleural biopsy, fluid cytologic analysis and pleurex catheter placement. In surgery, 600 cc of amber clear pleural fluid was drained; several tan areas on the parietal pleura were biopsied and sent for both frozen and permanent pathologic analysis. Frozen pathology was negative for malignancy, and final pathology demonstrated right pleural biopsy with markedly reactive mesothelial cells with chronic and minimal acute inflammation. The post-operative pleural fluid analysis was transudative (, December 2019).", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24523610': 1, '19554543': 1, '30191008': 1, '24523608': 1, '21989666': 1, '10221307': 1, '32855786': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
