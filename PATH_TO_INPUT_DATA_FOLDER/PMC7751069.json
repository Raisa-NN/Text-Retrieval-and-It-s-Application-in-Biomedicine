Preoperative CT scan identified a 56 mm infrarenal AAA and a 26 mm right IIA aneurysm, with chronic total occlusion of left IIA, and collateral circulation from the left femoral artery (). At first, the right IIA was embolized by using Tornado coils. Subsequently, EVAR was conducted using an Endurant stent graft system (Medtronic, Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA). Distal legs of the endograft were placed in the right EIA and left CIA. Four days after EVAR, the patient complained of right lower limb paresis. Brain MRI and CT scans did not identify any abnormal findings. Initially, the patient appeared to recover well and was able to walk around the ward. However, on the 12th postoperative day, he developed right lower limb paralysis for the second time. Emergency spinal MRI confirmed subacute spinal cord infarction at T3\u2013T6. He was treated medically without CSF drainage. Although his muscle power improved to the point that he could walk with a cane, the patient died of lung cancer 21 months later.", "age": "[[77.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17957407': 1, '29019146': 1, '17920309': 1, '15472597': 1, '10220681': 1, '20206815': 1, '27738476': 1, '16242540': 1, '19230726': 1, '11563894': 1, '33384742': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7751069-1': 2, '7751069-2': 2}"}
