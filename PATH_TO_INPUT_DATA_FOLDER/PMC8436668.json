The pool was filled 1 week prior with unchlorinated water drawn from a nearby artesian well. The patient reportedly had a low-grade fever, could barely walk on her heels, and frequently laid down crying from pain. On examination, she had ill-defined erythematous nodules on her forefoot and on the digital pulp of the toes on both feet (shown in Fig. ). No other skin lesions were noted. Her father reported that her 2 siblings also experienced similar but less severe symptoms. Her past medical history was unremarkable. The patient's mother soaked her feet in salt and lime, applied petroleum jelly, and gave her bed rest, all of which reportedly decreased the pain. All lesions resolved within 3 days with minimal peeling of the skin. A water sample was taken for testing from the residual water on the smooth plastic flooring of the pool. The results of the test are as follows: HPC >300 CFU/mL, total coliforms = 28 CFU/100 mL, fecal coliforms <1 CFU/100 mL, and P. aeruginosa = 86 CFU/100 mL.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'630358': 1, '11484690': 1, '22980262': 1, '22508979': 1, '11147761': 1, '9615125': 1, '9572690': 1, '15602385': 1, '11552337': 1, '29730146': 1, '18335877': 1, '22187332': 1, '23247477': 1, '11757518': 1, '10809873': 1, '16054324': 1, '11270254': 1, '15283792': 1, '9643332': 1, '26371476': 1, '7798384': 1, '29191346': 1, '17658195': 1, '34594199': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
