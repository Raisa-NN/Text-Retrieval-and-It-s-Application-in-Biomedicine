His past medical history was unremarkable. In his physical examination, blood pressure was recorded at 110/70 mmHg and his heart rate was 40 bpm. A complete atrioventricular block was revealed by an electrocardiogram (ECG) (Figure ). Routine laboratory test results were normal. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a cystic formation of size 3.7 \u00d7 2.5 cm situated in the basal part of the interventricular septum (Figure ). We noted also a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (40%). Cardiac computed tomographic examination showed a well-defined cystic lesion in the interventricular septum, suggestive of hydatid cyst (Figure ). Serologic tests for echinococcal infection were strongly positive. Thus, cardiac hydatid cyst with intraseptal involvement diagnosis was made.\\nOwing to the size and location of the calcified cyst, surgical resection was not considered in order to minimize the risk of rupture of the contents; medical treatment with albendazole was initiated. A permanent pacemaker was implanted. The patient was discharged with albendazole treatment and was doing well at four months follow up.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20401292': 1, '21358231': 1, '19931502': 1, '31499211': 1, '5545589': 1, '28028503': 1, '33425524': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
