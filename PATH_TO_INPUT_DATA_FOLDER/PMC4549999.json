The patient was of Chinese ethnicity and was accompanied by her mother. Patient's medical history revealed underlying Williams syndrome. Detailed history, extra-oral examination, intra-oral examination, and radiographic evaluations were performed. Extra-oral examination revealed the long face, broad forehead, wide cheeks, underdeveloped mandible, pouting lips, and widely spaced eyes. The characteristic \u201celfin facies\u201d seen in Williams syndrome was noticed []. Intra-oral examination revealed Angle's class III malocclusion []. The mandibular right lateral incisor was screwdriver shaped [Figure and ]. Plaque and calculus deposits, especially in the mandibular anterior region, deep pits and fissures and dental caries, was noticed in maxillary left and right second molars []. Intra-oral periapical radiographs were taken which showed generalized widening of the periodontal ligament space [Figure \u2013]. Pulp vitality tests revealed that the teeth were vital. No history of trauma was reported. A treatment plan involving oral prophylaxis, pit and fissure sealants, and restorations for carious teeth were planned for the patient. Due to the various systemic complications associated with Williams syndrome, the patient was referred to the physician for medical opinion and consent for the above mentioned dental treatment.\\nPatient's physician provided the medical consent for dental treatment, along with the medical history of the patient.
