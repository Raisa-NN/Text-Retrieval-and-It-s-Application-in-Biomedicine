Over the counter medications did not relieve his symptoms. On the day of presentation, he experienced difficulty in walking and according to his friends he seemed to be mildly confused. He neither complained of any visual changes nor had any seizures. He is of Indian origin, professional, and married with a child. His history was negative for smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use. He came to United States six months prior to onset of these symptoms for his job. He did not have any sick contacts with or exposure to wildlife. He did not receive any vaccination within the recent past.\\nOn physical examination his vital signs are within normal limits. He was oriented to only person and place but he did not have any other focal neurological deficits. Other systems examinations were within normal limits. His initial basic labs were within normal limits. Computerized tomography (CT) scan of head did not reveal any acute intracranial process.\\nA spinal tap was performed and patient was started on empiric antibiotic therapy and Acyclovir. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was consistent with aseptic meningitis (White Blood Cell Count (WBC)-287 cells/mL with lymphocytic predominance, glucose at 30 mg/100 mL, and protein at 236 mg/100 mL) and did not reveal any albuminocytological dissociation. Based on CSF findings, antibiotics were discontinued, Acyclovir was continued, and its course was completed.\\nOn the second day of admission, his mental status worsened; he developed seizure and went into respiratory failure which needed intubation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain performed during that time course revealed symmetrical increased T-2 (Figures and ) signal in bilateral basal ganglia, thalami, and middle cerebellar peduncles and did not show any gross enhancement on postcontrast images except for small amount of subependymal enhancement along the occipital horns. Increased FLAIR signal along the cerebral leptomeningeal surface in certain areas and along brainstem was also evident. Multiple microhemorrhages are identified in corpus callosum, gray white matter junction, and brainstem. Mild diffusion restriction in corpus callosum and left hippocampus was present. Findings were consistent with ADEM possibly infectious/inflammatory/autoimmune mediated. MRI cervical spine showed mild enlargement of cervical cord and mild diffusely increased T-2 signal. Postcontrast images were without abnormal enhancement or focal lesions. MRI of thoracic and lumbar spine was normal.\\nTen days after admission, patient developed ascending lower limb weakness and ultimately went into comatose state. He was treated with steroids, IVIG, and plasmapheresis for possible parainfectious demyelinating polyradiculopathy or parainfectious encephalomyelitis. Nerve conduction and electromyography studies were not suggestive of the Guillain-Barre syndrome. Patient did not respond to immunomodulators, so the Guillain-Barre syndrome was not considered as possible cause of patient's medical condition.\\nFurther studies from CSF analysis were positive for oligoclonal bands, West Nile IgG, and Epstein-Barr's virus (EBV) IgG antibodies and negative for West Nile IgM, HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR), West Nile PCR, lyme titers, VDRL, anti-Hu antibodies, and acid fast bacilli. CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and ultrasound of testis did not reveal any primary malignancy. Serum anti-NMDA receptor antibodies and paraneoplastic panel were negative.\\nThree weeks after admission, patient was still unresponsive with no gag, cough, blinking to threat, eye tracking or deep tendon reflexes. Due to his persistent altered mental status, brain biopsy (right frontal approach) was performed. It did not reveal any evidence of inflammation, caseating, or noncaseating granulomas. After five weeks, MRI brain () was repeated which revealed more pronounced brainstem involvement and still has persistent signal abnormality along sulci in postcontrast and FLAIR images. Electroencephalogram revealed evidence of diffuse encephalopathy.\\nAfter approximately six weeks, he was alert and awake and began tracking with his eyes. He responded to simple commands like facial and neck movements (given in his native language) and did not respond to the commands given in English (Even though he knew how to speak English before the onset of illness). Unfortunately eye-coded alphabetical communication system was not available in his native language, and thus it was not performed. Pupils were equal and reactive. Extraocular movements were intact and full. There was some nystagmus noted, more on the left side than the right side. Fundus examination was normal. No facial asymmetry was noted. He has some intact sensation over the face bilaterally to pinprick. He was able to open his mouth partially. No words are being produced at this time. He was completely nonverbal.\\nOn motor examination he was quadriplegic. His power both in upper and lower extremities was 0/5 on Medical Research Council scale. Some occasional flickers of contractions were seen in bilateral lower extremities. He had some sensations intact in the upper limbs, face, and chest area symmetrically with pinprick stimulation, but no sensation was appreciated below the waist. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in bilateral upper and lower extremities. Hypertonia was seen in all four extremities. Plantars are upgoing bilaterally. Because of the above findings, he was diagnosed to have incomplete LIS.\\nBecause of prolonged respiratory failure, patient got tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement for feeding. Patient's hospital course was complicated by repeated pulmonary infections. So detailed neuropsychological testing was not performed.\\nPatient was discharged to nursing home. His stay at nursing home was complicated by recurrent health care associated pneumonia and urinary tract infections which needed multiple admissions to hospitals.\\nApproximately seven months later repeat MRI brain () showed marked atrophy of the brainstem, predominantly in the pons and abnormal signal in the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles. MRI cervical spine () showed increased volume loss in the cervical and upper thoracic cord. His physical exam was still consistent with an incomplete LIS.", "age": "[[34.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22460967': 1, '16155147': 1, '2544743': 1, '92545': 1, '19368974': 1, '17109290': 1, '23307010': 1, '33791064': 1, '15309665': 1, '17879907': 1, '15718541': 1, '12119075': 1, '9988625': 1, '15885053': 1, '16934166': 1, '23306659': 1, '19748042': 1, '22914374': 1, '9197215': 1, '16401850': 1, '23196954': 1, '24977089': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
