When questioned about this behaviour, he claimed that he was waiting for his next-door neighbour, who held a spare set of his flat keys, since he had accidentally locked his set in his garage. However, while he believed her to be on holiday, she had actually been living in a retirement home for 2 years. His medical history was significant only for a craniotomy, performed 16 years before, for the excision of a left parietal meningioma, with no residual neurological deficits, and hypertension, for which he did not take any drugs. He admittedly consumed more than a litre of wine per day but denied smoking. His psychiatric history was unremarkable, but in recent years he had begun packing his flat with \u2018art pieces\u2019. An electrocardiogram performed in the emergency department revealed the presence of atrial fibrillation, and a chest radiography showed a right lower lobe consolidation, which were treated with oral medication because he refused any infusion therapy. He was initially admitted to the geriatric department and then moved to the psychiatric unit because of repeated instances of wandering and a quarrel with another homeless in-patient. When contacted, the patient's building manager reported behavioural changes over the past few years, and a recent history of pathological hoarding was confirmed by his general practitioner. A mental state examination revealed confabulation, along with a more structured delusion about being married to a counterterrorism spy, daughter of a 19th-century marshal, with whom he would communicate only non-verbally in order for her not to be discovered. Neuropsychological evaluation outlined an impairment in selective attention and letter verbal fluency retrieval, in the context of an overall preserved mental functioning, with a score of 26/30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); a subsequent more thorough testing for language excluded semantic impairment (). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mild temporo-insular atrophy on both sides and calcifications in the left lenticular nucleus; fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed mild hypometabolism in the left superior temporal gyrus; amyloid PET did not reveal areas of increased radiotracer binding, ruling out an underlying amyloid brain deposition (). The search for expansion in the Chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene gave negative results, and no mutations were detected through next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. According to Rascovsky criteria, a diagnosis of bvFTD was made. In view of agitation and delusions, the patient was initially prescribed clotiapine, then shifted to zuclopenthixol and eventually to haloperidol, with only partial response. After the hospital admission, the patient was admitted to a care home.", "age": "[[77.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26505142': 1, '18004150': 1, '10752704': 1, '16262113': 1, '28660777': 1, '29142083': 1, '23582297': 1, '3501323': 1, '5919035': 1, '15178953': 1, '29145187': 1, '46514': 1, '23313647': 1, '30011337': 1, '23393422': 1, '20836916': 1, '20525545': 1, '21810890': 1, '16790250': 1, '31715541': 1, '23431842': 1, '22284815': 1, '16315145': 1, '27522332': 1, '27498041': 1, '25091139': 1, '9793576': 1, '33526159': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
