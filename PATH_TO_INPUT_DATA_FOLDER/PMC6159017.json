Ten years earlier, she was diagnosed with AS, which is well-controlled medically. On the neurological examination, Phalen's test and Tinel's sign were positive. She had right thenar muscle atrophy with normal muscle power. Electrodiagnostic evaluation revealed severe median nerve compression at the right wrist. The patient underwent surgery for severe CTS. A mini-incision was made on the palmar side of the hand. During the operation, the flexor retinaculum could not be incised due to marked stiffness. The incision was extended distally and proximally. Ossification of the flexor retinaculum was seen and the retinaculum was partially excised with an osteotome and Kerrison rongeur, which effectively decompressed the median nerve. The patient's complaints resolved almost totally after the operation. Postoperative wrist computed tomography (CT) and three-dimensional CT scan showed heterotopic ossification causing compression of the median nerve [Figures and ]. At the 1-year follow-up, she had no numbness or pain in her hand.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'25556510': 1, '25260647': 1, '27785396': 1, '28761537': 1, '12898316': 1, '30283583': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
