He drank approximately 32 units of alcohol per week and was an ex-smoker with 40 pack years. Physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory investigation showed C-reactive protein 332 mg l\u22121, white cell count 40.0 (neutrophils 38.9) \u00d7 109 l\u22121, d-dimer 22 447 ng ml\u22121, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.4, lactate 2.5 mmol l\u22121 and platelets 139\u00d7109 l\u22121.\\nA blood culture was taken and intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 2.5 g t.i.d. was started. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his head could not differentiate between intraventricular blood and pus. Unfortunately, a lumbar puncture was not performed due to agitation and a raised INR. The following day magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed which showed a ventriculitis and piperacillin/tazobactam was discontinued and intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g b.i.d. was started. A PCR for respiratory viruses was negative. His human immunodeficiency virus test was negative and immunoglobulin levels were normal. MRI of his right foot showed a tenosynovitis. The next day a venous blood culture was positive with Gram-negative diplococci in both aerobic and anaerobic bottles which subsequently were identified as N. meningitidis (API NH system) with the following MICs: penicillin 0.094 mg l\u22121, cefotaxime 0.003 mg l\u22121, rifampicin 0.023 mg l\u22121 and ciprofloxacin 0.008 mg l\u22121. Rifampicin was added for 1 week. The patient continued to show clinical improvement and was discharged home on outpatient antibiotic therapy to complete 6 weeks of treatment. He received a meningococcal vaccine (against groups A, C, W135 and Y). At a follow-up appointment, he had fully recovered with no neurological sequelae.", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31803684': 2, '845671': 1, '18982457': 1, '24628728': 2, '34484750': 1, '24155000': 1, '27043949': 1, '33312808': 2, '23090839': 1, '34666698': 1, '19156484': 1, '17646978': 1, '29563488': 1, '18277040': 1, '17612921': 1, '30788218': 1, '11559498': 1, '2179305': 1, '33585333': 1, '20930076': 1, '34026150': 1, '17157709': 1, '32104733': 1, '28348798': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7725490-1': 1, '3986469-1': 1, '6881931-1': 1}"}
