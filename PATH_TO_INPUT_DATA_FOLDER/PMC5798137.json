His past medical history included hypertension, coronary artery disease, stable chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and newly diagnosed congestive heart failure (CHF) with moderate aortic valve insufficiency seen on outpatient echocardiogram 3 weeks earlier. Vital signs were within normal limits, and physical exam revealed a non-focal neurologic examination, diastolic heart murmur and diffuse mild abdominal pain. Admission laboratories were notable for WBC of 18 500/mm3 (slightly increased above CLL baseline), with neutrophil predominance. Brain MRI (Fig. ) and trans-esophageal echocardiography revealed multiple bilateral areas of restricted diffusion consistent with ischemic stroke, as well as a 2.2 cm aortic valve vegetation with severe aortic regurgitation, but no intra-cardiac abscess. Blood cultures confirmed Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis. Abdominal CT scan (Fig. ) revealed an 8.1 cm splenic lesion consistent with splenic abscess.\\nThough hemodynamically stable, his neurologic status deteriorated despite antibiotic therapy, with signs and symptoms of worsening CHF. A multi-disciplinary team determined emergent aortic VR (AVR) was necessary given his cardiac decompensation and ongoing neurologic decline. Simultaneous splenectomy and AVR were not considered a viable option. Instead, the splenic abscess was percutaneously drained and the patient underwent successful AVR with a 25 mm Magna bioprosthetic valve and two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. His post-operative course was largely unremarkable\u2014however, severe deconditioning and malnutrition prevented interval splenectomy. His drain was removed and he discharged to a transitional care unit (TCU) with IV antibiotics.\\nAfter 12 weeks of intravenous antibiotic treatment, repeat CT revealed a persistent 7-cm splenic fluid collection. Definitive splenectomy was recommended to prevent re-infection of the aortic valve, and he underwent an uncomplicated robotic-assisted (da Vinci) splenectomy. His post-operative course was uneventful, and he discharged to TCU in stable condition. At 2-year follow-up, patient is doing well living independently at home.", "age": "[[75.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15956145': 1, '21358398': 1, '19652096': 1, '9788024': 1, '19273776': 1, '21620012': 1, '32849876': 2, '15503101': 1, '12735596': 1, '29423161': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7441411-1': 1}"}
