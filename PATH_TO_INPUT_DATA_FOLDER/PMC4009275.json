Patient's history revealed aortic valve replacement taking place two years ago, patient's native valve was tricuspid and ascending aorta diameter was 4.3 cm at the time of operation. Physical examination revealed systolic 3/6 murmur along the left sternal border. Transthoracic echocardiography showed functional prosthetic aortic valve and ascending aortic aneurysm including sinuses of valsalva with dissection flap extending to the innominate artery. Aneurysm's transverse diameter was measured as 8.5 cm with computerized tomography (). Coronary arteries were found normal by angiography. Patient underwent redo cardiac surgery. We institutioned femorofemoral cardiopulmonary bypass and reopened sternum. A giant ascending aorta aneurysm was seen. Following retrograde cold blood cardioplegia, aneurysm was transected just above the right coronary artery ostium. Prosthetic valve was functional but supra annular space was considered inappropriate to graft interposition. Prosthetic valve was removed. Modified Bentall procedure was performed with no: 25 valved conduit. Distal anastomosis was done under aortic cross clamp. Operation was completed as usual fashion (). Postoperative course was uneventful. Patient was discharged at the postoperative 8th day in well condition.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21170625': 1, '9782593': 1, '20185035': 1, '14666961': 1, '11156055': 1, '23471151': 1, '8213585': 1, '23246059': 1, '19741548': 1, '17259184': 1, '18799444': 1, '16928994': 1, '22532815': 1, '21094365': 1, '24839447': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
