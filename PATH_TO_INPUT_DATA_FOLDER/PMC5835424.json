She had a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin therapy, ischemic strokes and peripheral artery disease with multiple prior percutaneous endovascular interventions including placement of 2 Viabahn endograft stents in the left SFA for diffuse instent disease (5.0\u00d7100 mm and 5.0\u00d7150 mm, W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA). Given the acute nature of symptoms she was referred for urgent angiography which confirmed an acute thrombotic occlusion of the Viabahn endografts extending from the ostium of the left SFA to the proximal portion of the left popliteal artery (). Upon confirming an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.7 and having a multi-disciplinary team discussion, we proceeded with an endovascular strategy that focused on limiting thrombolytic exposure. We positioned an Emboshield 0.014 NAV6 filter (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in the distal left popliteal artery segment for embolic protection and delivered the Jetstream XC (2.1 mm/3.0 mm) device to the site of thrombosis (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA). After performing mechanical aspiration thrombectomy of the occluded SFA and popliteal segments, follow-up angiography revealed no reflow distally in the popliteal segment with a filling defect just above the site of filter (). Aspiration thrombectomy was performed with a Pronto V3 extraction catheter (Vascular Solutions, Minneapolis, MN, USA) followed by administration of intra-arterial vasodilator agents (200 \u00b5g of nitroglycerin and 50 \u00b5g sodium nitroprusside, as a bolus doses). After confirming improved flow to the distal vessels, atherectomy and drug coated balloon angioplasty of the Viabahn stent edges was performed (5.0\u00d740 mm, Bard Lutonix, New Hope, MN, USA). The follow-up angiogram again demonstrated no reflow distally in the infrapopliteal vessels at which time the filter was removed, intra-arterial vasodilator agents were administered and selective balloon angioplasty of the tibio-peroneal and anterior tibial arteries was performed (2.0\u00d7200 mm, SAVVY balloon catheter; Cordis Corp, Miami Lakes, FL, USA). The follow-up angiogram demonstrated brisk flow in the infrapopliteal vessels with no residual stenosis or filling defects in the SFA or popliteal arteries. The patient was discharged less than 24 hours from the time of presentation with Coumadin and antiplatelet therapy. Despite close monitoring during follow-up, she presented with acute thrombosis of the Viabahn endografts 7 months later. She was subsequently referred for femoral-popliteal bypass surgery.", "age": "[[85.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26109627': 1, '26921281': 1, '18003983': 1, '23676191': 1, '7480694': 1, '26060377': 1, '26839391': 1, '22517514': 1, '8911400': 1, '25205540': 1, '29515712': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5835424-1': 2}"}
