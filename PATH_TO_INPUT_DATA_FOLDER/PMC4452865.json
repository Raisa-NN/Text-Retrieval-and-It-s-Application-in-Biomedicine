Her family and medical histories were unremarkable and her previous pregnancy resulted in a term delivery of a healthy male. Upon consultation, ultrasound examination confirmed a male infant with bilateral dilatation of the cerebral posterior horns of 32 mm, consistent with severe hydrocephaly (). Further examination with 3D ultrasound revealed fixed adduction of the thumbs (). With parental consent, cordocentesis was performed for cytogenetic and molecular analyses. Maternal blood was also sent for molecular genetic analysis. Direct sequencing on genomic DNA of the 28 exons of the L1CAM gene in maternal and fetal samples was positive for a novel nonsense mutation (c.3241C>T, p.Gln1081X) in exon 24 of the L1CAM gene. At 38 weeks, a 3,285 g male infant with hydrocephaly and bilateral adduction of the thumbs () was delivered by cesarean section. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted on day 10. The infant is currently 3 years of age; he had not reached minimal neurodevelopmental milestones and is under intensive rehabilitation.", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23220544': 1, '23820807': 1, '16702456': 1, '8809896': 1, '11438988': 1, '31662948': 1, '30235725': 1, '19953645': 1, '18136715': 1, '1303258': 1, '13889295': 1, '11787037': 1, '26078893': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4452865-1': 2}"}
