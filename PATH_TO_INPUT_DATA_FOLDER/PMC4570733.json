A resection of nevus on her forehead was performed about 2 weeks before her admission, which was intradermal nevus on the histopathology. The brain MRI was unremarkable and the EEG demonstrated generalized slow activity. The CSF analysis revealed the WBC count was 66/\u03bcL with 99 lymphocytes and 1 % monocytes, and the protein concentration level was 72 mg/dL. The same tests with serum and CSF for available antibodies to cell-surface antigens were performed as previously described. High titres of anti-NMDAR antibodies were both detected in the CSF and serum. The screening tests for an ovarian teratoma and other tumors were all negative. She received one course of intravenous immunoglobulin, 2 g/kg, divided into 5 days, followed with intravenous methylprednisolone at an initial dosage of 80 mg per day. Gradually, her psychotic symptoms resolved and she was able to follow simple commands and talk to her parents. The test for NMDAR antibody in CSF became negative afterwards while that in serum remained positive.", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'1350383': 1, '29846779': 1, '17262855': 1, '31619447': 1, '29128985': 1, '32953776': 1, '16420247': 1, '27098800': 1, '27473459': 2, '18851928': 1, '15265015': 1, '20511282': 1, '15174101': 1, '26370233': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4570733-1': 2, '4966559-1': 1}"}
