She noticed that the lesions initially appeared one year earlier. She had no changes to her medications.\\nCutaneous examination revealed a woman with Fitzpatrick skin type IV; her skin color was moderate brown, and she minimally burned and always tanned well after sun exposure. She had hyperpigmented, reticulated patches on the anterior and posterior surfaces of both lower legs (Figure ).\\nAdditional history, requested after evaluating her legs, revealed that she used a space heater under her metal desk at work because she was always cold in her office. Correlation of the patient\u2019s history and the clinical morphology of her skin lesions established a diagnosis of erythema ab igne. She was advised to immediately discontinue the use of the space heater at work.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18624869': 1, '18119955': 1, '8453844': 1, '31487346': 1, '29057464': 1, '507871': 1, '33364102': 2, '30609105': 1, '22747929': 1, '27931765': 1, '29799574': 2, '33754117': 2, '32016151': 1, '31993267': 2, '30033913': 1, '19932909': 1, '32054846': 1, '21243322': 1, '34703425': 2, '29596683': 1, '20964656': 1, '26058671': 1, '29447656': 1, '32537275': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8488418-1': 1, '7749800-1': 1, '5965334-1': 1, '5965334-2': 1, '5965334-3': 1, '6970441-1': 1, '7971733-1': 1}"}
