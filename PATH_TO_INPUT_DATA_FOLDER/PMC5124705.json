The patient\u2019s past medical history was uneventful, with no weight loss, no episodes of fever or shivering, no evidence for dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract, and no previous abdominal surgeries. The patient underwent a screening colonoscopy without any pathologic findings. A clinical examination revealed abdominal distention in the left lower quadrant without peritonitis or resistance. An abdominal CT scan showed an inflammatory infiltration of the mesenteric adipose tissue with lymphadenopathy, interpreted as sclerosing mesenteritis without evidence of malignancy or other pathology (Figures and ). The pain declined further in the course spontaneously without any treatment.", "age": "[[56.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18682417': 1, '21882092': 1, '19673029': 1, '12563249': 1, '34054123': 1, '27403104': 2, '22421723': 2, '17590109': 1, '25701479': 1, '25271412': 1, '7399242': 1, '15599220': 1, '17650941': 1, '17910751': 2, '15300397': 1, '30317189': 1, '22462435': 1, '17496688': 1, '27933138': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5124705-1': 2, '5124705-2': 2, '3326978-1': 1, '2092431-1': 1, '4929367-1': 1}"}
