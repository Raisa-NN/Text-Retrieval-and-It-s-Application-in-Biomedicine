It had pedicle in correspondence of malleus's manubrium ().\\nA CT scan showed a round smooth mass (3 mm of diameter) external to the tympanic membrane (). There was no evidence of bone erosion or middle ear extension. Audiometric testing showed mixed hearing loss in the left ear (20\u201330 dB air-bone gap at 250\u20131000 Hz).\\nA transcanal surgical resection was performed. The lesion was removed, leaving the fibrous and the mucosal drum layers intact.\\nPathologic examination revealed a well-defined proliferation of dilated tortuous vascular structures, closely adhering to each other, filled by erythrocytes in the lumen. They varied in size and were delimited by a single layer of flat endothelial cells. Superficially, the lesion was lined by hyperkeratotic squamous epithelium. These features were consistent with a cavernous hemangioma (). The postoperative course was uneventful, and conductive hearing loss disappeared. There has been no recurrence for 1 year postoperatively.", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'6650669': 1, '16137537': 1, '22500069': 1, '17499135': 1, '6829733': 1, '646727': 1, '21716950': 2, '12368608': 1, '21130527': 1, '23119662': 1, '4563050': 1, '11555766': 1, '3560305': 1, '11821770': 1, '2321686': 1, '23243539': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3109327-1': 1}"}
