He was born at 38 weeks and had an episode of bronchiolitis at the age of 3 months. He was operated on because of the enlarging multi-cystic mass in right lower lobe with thoracic scoliosis.\\nHe was induced with O2 and sevoflurane and intubated with fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and atracurium 0.6 mg/kg. Surgery was commenced after positioning left lateral with left bronchial intubation using a 3.0-mm-cuffed tube and single-lung ventilation. A thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy was performed and recovered with no complications. The surgical duration was prolonged (7 h) and hypercapnia became an increasing problem during the latter part (at 4.5 h) with significant respiratory acidosis. The endotracheal tube had bloodstained secretions and was blocked, which needed washout with saline to clear the obstruction. The peak PaCO2 recorded was 16.1 kPa with an associated arterial pH of 6.93. His post-operative SpO2 was 99% on room air on day 2 and he made an uneventful recovery.", "age": "[[9.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21960427': 1, '31013391': 1, '30746175': 1, '16202899': 1, '27723920': 1, '19907314': 1, '30974433': 1, '28442980': 1, '34658730': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8477759-1': 2}"}
