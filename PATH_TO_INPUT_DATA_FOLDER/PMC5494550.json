The procedure was followed by hypotension requiring epinephrine drip and a large amount of blood was noted coming from the endotracheal tube. Bronchoscopy revealed blood in the airways left more than right (), a large blood clot in the left main bronchus, a bleeding source likely left lower lobe (LLL), and negative BAL for PAH in the right middle lobe (RML). Hemoglobin dropped by 2 g/dl. CT chest angiography was negative for PE and showed bilateral lower lobes GGO present on previous imaging consistent with HF (). Pressors were weaned off with volume resuscitation and the patient was successfully extubated with no further pulmonary bleeding. He was initially maintained on low dose aspirin. Clopidogrel and warfarin were added few days later and clopidogrel was discontinued when anticoagulation was therapeutic.", "age": "[[83.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16302901': 1, '21686645': 1, '23378298': 1, '7864412': 1, '7739712': 1, '10653069': 1, '18491433': 1, '24383034': 2, '22588322': 1, '28706742': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5494550-1': 2, '3870642-1': 1}"}
