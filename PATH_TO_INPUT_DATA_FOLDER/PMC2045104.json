She had Crohn's disease since the age of 21. A flare of Crohn's ileocolitis was developing for five months, with diarrhea and abdominal pain. On clinical examination, she had asymptomatic, infiltrated, erythematous and ulcerated, papules and plaques of the calves, and a right keratoconjonctivitis. After clinical examination, diagnostic hypotheses were Sweet's syndrome, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, and mycobacterial, fungal or bacterial skin infection. Repeated bacteriological and mycological investigations were negative. Histological examination showed a necrotizing vasculitis characterized by thromboses and necroses of dermal blood vessels associated with a dermal infiltrate of pycnotic neutrophilic granulocytes. The hypodermis enclosed non-caseating epithelioid granulomata with multinucleated giant cells consistent with a cutaneous Crohn's disease. Ziehl, Grocott and PAS staining failed to identify infectious agents. Considering the ongoing flare of Crohn's ileocolitis, a systemic treatment was introduced. The plaques decreased by more than 50% after 6 weeks of treatment with prednisolone (45 mg/day) and azathioprine (100 mg/day).", "age": "[[51.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'10565637': 1, '33898705': 1, '957999': 1, '12167685': 1, '24713996': 1, '14652821': 1, '3408668': 1, '28127561': 2, '9146530': 1, '11809204': 1, '6459345': 1, '10025760': 1, '15149534': 1, '17910771': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2045104-1': 2, '5239966-1': 1}"}
