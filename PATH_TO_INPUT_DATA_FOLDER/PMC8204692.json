She was admitted to our hospital for the presence of an enlarged right anterior cervical mass for more than 1 year. She had no other discomfort but occasional dyspnea. Neck ultrasonography showed one gigantic mass measuring ~90 \u00d7 39 \u00d7 29 mm located in the right thyroid. Further investigation with CTA () showed that the mass of the right thyroid lobe invaded the initial segment of the esophagus and compressed the trachea. Filling defects were found in the right internal jugular vein, right brachiocephalic vein, and SVC and extended to the right atrium. The results of FNA in the cervical mass and embolus of the right internal jugular vein revealed follicular cells with atypia of undetermined significance, and consequently, a diagnosis of FTC with invasion into the mediastinal great veins was suspected. The ECHO indicated an enlargement of the left atrium.
