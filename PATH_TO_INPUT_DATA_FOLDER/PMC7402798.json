An abdominal ultrasound showed a multi-lobed cystic mass arising from the pancreatic body and tail. An obstetric ultrasound showed a normal fetus of 17 weeks and 5 days (via fetal biometry). An MRI revealed a multi-lobed neoplasm, arising from the body and tail of the pancreas with thin internal septations. The neoplasm measured 11.8 cm \u00d7 11.6 cm \u00d7 9.5 cm (Fig. ). Serum level of tumor marker CEA was 51.92 ng/mL, CA 19-9 was 4.09 U/mL, and CA 125 was 38.6 U/mL. All other blood, serum, and urinary laboratory determinations were normal. A distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. The surgical findings included a 15-cm diameter thick-walled pancreatic neoplasm, with internal septations and dark-brownish mucinous fluid (Fig. ). The neoplasm was adhered to the spleen, mesocolon, and diaphragm. Left-sided venous hypertension was noted because of splenic vein compression. The patient was discharged 12 days postoperatively without complications. Pathological examination showed a mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas lined by columnar epithelial cells with an associated invasive adenocarcinoma and extensive areas of high-grade dysplasia (carcinoma in situ). The underlying ovarian-type stroma showed positivity for PR, ER, and \u03b1-inhibin (Fig. ). The patient refused to receive chemotherapy because of the concern for congenital malformations. She continued to full term, delivering a healthy baby by Caesarean section at 38 weeks. After delivery, the patient did not undergo chemotherapy and has remained symptom-free with no detectable recurrence for 5 years of follow-up. Her child is developing normally.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27661036': 1, '17957438': 1, '15714143': 1, '25195964': 1, '23276571': 1, '23343567': 1, '20393031': 1, '28937575': 1, '19542723': 1, '18362619': 1, '29264591': 2, '18176976': 1, '22042244': 1, '17486054': 1, '25441310': 1, '20185662': 1, '25517958': 1, '19084943': 1, '19669687': 1, '21128317': 1, '27760255': 1, '17530280': 1, '28333816': 1, '17917820': 1, '17290080': 1, '17446848': 1, '19307500': 1, '22579258': 1, '1601927': 1, '22687371': 1, '21561347': 1, '22811861': 1, '24650968': 1, '26943381': 2, '16327281': 1, '22160782': 1, '18209157': 1, '8149804': 1, '34066323': 2, '23526506': 1, '27681503': 1, '16365826': 1, '23415799': 1, '22709451': 1, '17372823': 1, '9926740': 1, '34786394': 2, '16552345': 1, '2368178': 1, '17952538': 1, '21071901': 1, '20924309': 1, '21166940': 1, '17446849': 1, '23813932': 1, '32756169': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7402798-1': 2, '8567505-1': 1, '4747942-1': 1, '5736748-1': 1, '8148137-1': 1}"}
