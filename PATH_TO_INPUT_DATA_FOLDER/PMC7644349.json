She had acquired permanent tattoos on both eyebrows with black colorant 6 years previously for cosmetic reasons at an unlicensed beauty shop. The mass measured 1.2\u00d70.7 cm, had the appearance of a bunch of grapes, was black-colored and hard-textured, and had grown beyond the boundaries of the black tattoo pigment (). She had no relevant family or medical history. Her job involved working indoors, without abundant sunlight exposure.\\nThe patient was very reluctant regarding the possibility of a broad scar after wide excision. Since BCC rarely metastasizes, a staged excision was planned, with the possibility of additionally performing wide excision in the second procedure depending on the histopathological results of the first operation. The firststage excision was performed, removing most of the mass, and she was diagnosed with BCC based on a histopathological examination (). After 2 months, wide excision and primary closure were performed for the remnant BCC (). On histopathological examination, a clear margin was obtained, and there was no lymphovascular invasion. No recurrence was observed after 3 years of follow-up ().", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'32630993': 2, '22469126': 1, '20523804': 1, '29234718': 1, '1000112': 1, '21722139': 1, '31812363': 1, '33143401': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7349131-1': 1}"}
