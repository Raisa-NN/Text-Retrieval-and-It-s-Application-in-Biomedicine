BA had been diagnosed 20 years earlier. Although she has been treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroid, a long acting \u03b22 agonist and a leukotriene receptor antagonist, she experienced frequent exacerbations of BA, and short-term oral corticosteroid bursts were occasionally administered. Her FeNO was elevated (53 ppb). Blood tests revealed eosinophilia (3480 /\u00b5L) and a high total IgE level (353 IU/mL). High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest revealed diffuse centrilobular nodules and bronchial wall thickening in both lungs. In addition, patchy ground-glass opacities were observed around the bronchioles (). The pulmonary function test demonstrated obstructive impairment (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1): 1.55 L, 65.7%; coefficient G for the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity: 57.8%; the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC): 43.3% with airflow obstruction). The result of bronchodilator reversibility testing was positive.", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23258778': 1, '20548323': 1, '9531318': 1, '2202307': 1, '26823212': 1, '24390219': 1, '8097323': 1, '31678294': 1, '27609408': 1, '28530840': 1, '21107087': 1, '31666048': 2, '11416256': 1, '34667050': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6822466-1': 1}"}
