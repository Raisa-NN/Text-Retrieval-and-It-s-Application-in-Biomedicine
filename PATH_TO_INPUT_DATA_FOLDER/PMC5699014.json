On examination, infant had altered sensorium with heart rate: 110/min, respiratory rate: 64/min, blood pressure: 90 mmHg (systolic), capillary filling time: <3 s, bronchial breath sounds in bilateral mammary and left axillary area, liver span: 13 cm, spleen: Tip palpable, anterior fontanelle: At level, no skin or mucosal bleeds, and neurodeficits. Growth and development was appropriate for age. Provisional diagnosis of pneumonia with sepsis was considered. Preliminary laboratory investigations of anemia (hemoglobin 9 g/dl), lymphocytosis (P38L60E2), thrombocytopenia (platelet 89,000cells/mm3), peripheral smear: Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, low erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (3 mm in 1st h) and elevated liver enzymes: Serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase (460U/L), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (2691 U/L), suggested hemophagocytosis. On further investigation of prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (65.4), increased fibrin degradation products, hypertriglyceridemia (2.33 mmol/l), and hyperferritinemia (4652 ng/ml) confirmed MAS as per diagnostic criteria (2004).[] Blood, urine cultures and workup for dengue, leptospira were negative. Intravenous methyl prednisolone (IVMP) was initiated at 30 mg/kg/day along with ceftriaxone, amikacin, and supportive therapy. There was clinical worsening with decreasing platelet count on day 2, hence intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg was added, and antibiotic changed to meropenem. She developed acute respiratory distress syndrome with shock on day 3 and was supported with mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were corrected with blood component therapy. IVMP was given for 5 days followed by oral prednisolone at 2 mg/kg/day. Throat swab virology (real time polymerase chain reaction) isolated influenza B virus. She was extubated after 6 days of ventilation. Feeds were gradually initiated, antibiotics were given for 10 days and she was discharged on prednisolone for 4 weeks. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was not done due to thrombocytopenia. She is under follow-up for a year, gaining appropriate milestones and no major illness.", "age": "[[10.0, 'month']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'24319239': 1, '23401277': 1, '31714025': 1, '19325510': 1, '22886474': 1, '21828139': 1, '20303872': 1, '31579142': 2, '8403593': 1, '12087489': 1, '23690113': 1, '29279647': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6761467-1': 1}"}
