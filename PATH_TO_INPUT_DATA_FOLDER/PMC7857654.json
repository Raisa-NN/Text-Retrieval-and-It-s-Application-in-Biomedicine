The fracture fixation was done with a dynamic condylar screw(DCS) and left iliac crest bone graft. After 10 months of surgery, the patient came to the orthopaedic outpatient department with complaints of swelling in the left flank region for 1 month ().\\nOn examination, she had a soft reducible swelling over the incision site, which increased during coughing and standing and reduced while lying down. Swelling was non-pulsatile, increased with cough impulse (, ), and no other swelling was present anywhere else in the body. There was an evidence of bowel herniation lateral to the left iliac crest. X-ray of pelvis showed a large, full-thickness defect of the left iliac crest bone grafting site ().\\nWe informed about the operative treatment procedure and hernia complications such as incarceration or strangulation, but she was not ready for another surgery. Informed consent was taken and advised regular follow-up.", "age": "[[80.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'13738596': 1, '34440965': 1, '20182233': 1, '23761618': 1, '12409803': 1, '8769465': 1, '13263350': 1, '33585308': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
