Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed on these lumps, and the cytological examination showed nodular sclerosing HL, which was later confirmed by the results of an excisional biopsy (October 14, 2010). Visceral organ and bone involvement were not observed on X-ray and ultrasound examinations, suggesting the diagnosis of stage 3 HL. She was scheduled to receive 6 cycles of doxorubicin (25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15), vinblastine (6 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15), bleomycin (10 old units on days 1 and 15), and dacarbazine (375 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15) (1st line), but she refused to continue treatment after 4 cycles due to personal reasons. Ultrasound and CT scan were performed 1 month after the 4th cycle of chemotherapy. Previously noted lymphadenopathies were no longer observed, and the patient was considered to have complete remission (CR).\\nThe patient remained asymptomatic for 3.5 years. In March 2014, she experienced a recurrence of the lumps on her neck, armpits, and groins. Ultrasound and CT scan examination showed multiple cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathies, with hypertrophy of her right psoas major muscle, suggesting the presence of muscle infiltration (Fig ). She also complained of swollen feet, which according to Doppler examination were caused by bilateral thrombosis of the femoral and popliteal veins. She was treated with 7 cycles of ifosfamide (1,700 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2), carboplatin (4 AUC on days 1 and 2), etoposide (100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2), and mesna (1,700 mg/m2) (2nd line) followed by involved site radiation therapy. Prophylactic G-CSF was given on days 3\u20137 of each chemotherapy cycle. She received rivaroxaban (15 mg q.d.) for her deep vein thrombosis. Ultrasound was performed 1 month after the completion of radiotherapy (in January 2015). Her cervical lymphadenopathies were observed to be smaller with some tumor residue left, while lymphadenopathies of the other regions were no longer observed. The patient felt well and refused to receive further treatment.\\nAt the 9-month post-radiotherapy follow-up, she again experienced a recurrence of the lump on her neck, which was bigger than before. She was treated with 4 cycles of gemcitabine (600 mg/m2), vinorelbine (20 mg/m2), ifosfamide (1,700 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2), and mesna (1,700 mg/m2) (3rd line) (October 2015 \u2212 January 2016). The patient demonstrated clinical improvements and again refused to continue chemotherapy. Six months after her 3rd line therapy (in December 2016), the patient started to complain of tension headache. A head MRI was performed and no abnormalities were observed. One year after her 3rd line therapy (in August 2017), the patient complained of recurrent headache with progressive neck swelling (Fig ). fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed on her right retro-auricular lymph node (August 2017), showing cancerous cells consistent with HL. She was treated with gemcitabine (600 mg/m2), ifosfamide (1,700 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2), mesna (1,700 mg/m2), and prednisone (12-8-0 on days 1\u20134). The treatment was discontinued after 2 cycles according to the patient's request.\\nSix months after her 4th line therapy (in February 2018), her headache worsened, and she agreed to receive further treatment. At this point, we had run out of conventional therapeutic options and considered BV in light of its promising results. The patient's CD30 status was unknown, since at the time of her diagnosis (in 2010) BV had not yet been approved, thus CD30 expression had not been routinely checked, and we were not able to retrieve her biopsy specimen in 2018. With the patient's consent, we prescribed BV (1.2 mg/kg) for 6 cycles. The patient showed significant clinical improvements after 5 cycles of BV (Fig ). Gemcitabine (600 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) was added on the 6th cycle of BV as an effort to maximize treatment outcome.\\nPET scan was performed 1 month after the 6th cycle of BV (Fig ). Compared to previous CT scans, her cervical lymphadenopathy showed PR with tumor residue <1 cm. She received 2 more cycles of BV (1.2 mg/kg) with gemcitabine (600 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) and dexamethasone (40 mg on days 1\u20134). Another CT scan was performed 1 month after treatment completion. The previously noted lymphadenopathies were no longer observed, and both her liver and spleen appeared to be normal, suggesting a CR. No sign of recurrence was observed on a PET scan performed at the 6-month and the subsequent 18-month post-treatment follow-ups.\\nA serious adverse event was observed after the addition of gemcitabine on the 6th cycle of BV. The patient developed severe hypotension (50/36 mm Hg) with upper and lower limb petechiae and edema. These symptoms resolved after 3 days' treatment with vasopressor and high-dose corticosteroid. Dexamethasone (40 mg q.d. on days 1\u20134) was added for the subsequent 2 cycles of BV and gemcitabine to prevent the recurrence of this adverse event.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'30659762': 1, '26574847': 1, '28885612': 1, '30122620': 1, '22454421': 1, '22869887': 1, '25135752': 1, '23343832': 1, '32308602': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
