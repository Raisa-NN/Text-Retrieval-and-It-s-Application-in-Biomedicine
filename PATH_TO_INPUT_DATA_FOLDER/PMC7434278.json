He was independent with no comorbidities. He had normal observations and a normal examination. An ECG showed new right bundle branch block. A CXR showed bilateral peripheral areas of consolidation suspicious for COVID-19. A CTPA demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli with complete occlusion to the left lower lobar artery, a right sided pulmonary infarct, right heart strain (right ventricle:left ventricle ratio of 1.4:1), and patchy ground-glass shadowing suggestive of COVID-19.
