The patient had mild dyspnea and dry cough for two weeks. Closed thoracostomy was performed at the other hospital and was treated for 3 days. However, the chest X-ray revealed no improvement in the symptoms and lung expansion. Therefore, she was transferred to our hospital for surgery. She had no specific medical history and was a non-smoker. The initial vital signs were stable. A physical examination revealed that the breathing sounds were decreased in the left lung field. The chest X-ray showed a collapsed left lung with a large cyst (). Even after closed thoracostomy, a large amount of pneumothorax and collapsed lung were seen. When she was admitted in our hospital, we first applied a low-pressure suction pump and observed a little improvement in the lung expansion (). Over a period of five days, the chest X-ray showed a little day-by-day improvement, and the patient did not complain a bout the symptoms any more. However, she still had air leakage through the chest tube. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest demonstrated pulmonary edema caused by re-expansion and a large cystic lesion (measuring 2.0\u00d73.0 cm) in the left upper lobe (). It seemed to be connected between the cyst and the bronchus, but on the bronchoscopy, the cyst was observed to be a solitary lesion. Therefore, we decided to surgically control the air leak and performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. A 4-cm working window and two 10-mm ports were made. We could define the site of the air leakage site on the cyst, as observed on the chest CT. The cyst was close to the superior pulmonary vein. We attempted to close the cyst by manual sutures after opening the roof of the cyst because of the difficulty of wedge resection. However, several vessels were close to the cyst, there were multiple air leakage sites, and the densely adhered multiple nodules made primary closure impossible. Therefore, the left upper lobectomy of the lung was performed. A pathological examination of the specimen revealed a mesenchymal cystic hamartoma (MCH). On the macroscopic examination, the cut surface showed a cystic lesion (size: 2.0\u00d71.8 cm) and the cystic lesion was 1. 0 cm away from the bronchial resection margin (). The microscopic examination revealed that the cyst was lined by respiratory epithelium and the wall was composed of oval-to-spindle- shaped cells suspected to be mesenchymal cells (). A small intramural nodule was observed focally. The diagnosis was based in features such as multiple cysts, prominent cystic changes in the lung parenchyma, mesenchymal cell wall, and respiratory epithelium. The patient exhibited good progress after surgery. The chest tube was removed on postoperative day 6, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 without any complications.", "age": "[[16.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22632532': 1, '22231791': 1, '19280317': 1, '7831639': 1, '3773938': 1, '12945006': 1, '27525242': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
