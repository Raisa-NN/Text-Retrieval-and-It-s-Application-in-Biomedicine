The lesions had developed four days prior and she presented to an outside facility where incision and drainage was performed on one of the lesions. She was prescribed doxycycline on discharge. The lesions continued to spread and were associated with worsening pain. On exam she had multiple, tender violaceous nodules with surrounding erythema on the legs and one similar lesion on the right antecubital fossa at the site of a prior intravenous catheter from the outside facility ( and ).\\nLaboratory results were notable for elevated inflammatory markers. A wound culture was negative. The patient was admitted for further workup and pain control following treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone. A biopsy later performed ultimately supported the suspected diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum.", "age": "[[33.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'29478243': 1, '29450466': 1, '31925675': 1, '20227580': 1, '34437024': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
