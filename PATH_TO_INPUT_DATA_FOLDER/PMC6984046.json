She noticed that her eyelashes became elongated, thicker, and lost its natural curvature []. She noticed also that the emerging proximal hair became rough on palpation, but not the distal portion. She had some paronychia and an acneiform eruption on her trunk and arms. Some scalp hairs were carefully cut, in order to avoid artifacts, and the proximal and distal portions were examined in natura with scanning electron microscopy.\\nScanning electron microscopy of the proximal scalp hair portion showed important grooving, associated in some hairs with torsion []; some angulation of the hair shafts was also observed []. Single [] and double grooving were seen []. The distal portion of the same examined hairs, which were not yet clinically affected, showed only some weathering signs, with light irregularity of the cuticula [], without grooving or torsion.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'31149566': 1, '20736807': 1, '20843170': 1, '21738965': 1, '20530444': 1, '17147969': 1, '27588051': 1, '33223740': 2, '30069756': 1, '19692684': 1, '17207201': 1, '32030058': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7659746-1': 1}"}
