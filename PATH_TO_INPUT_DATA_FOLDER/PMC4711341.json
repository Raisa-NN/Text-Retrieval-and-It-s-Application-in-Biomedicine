X-ray examination revealed no involvement of the underlying bone and CT scans ruled out any further metastatic involvement. Tumor resection of the SCC resulted in an extended soft tissue defect (Figures A,B) that required microvascular flap coverage and preparation of an ipsilateral ALT flap with a size of 19 cm \u00d7 9 cm was performed (Figures C\u2013E). Histology confirmed complete tumor removal of the SCC (pTx, pN0, pM0, R0; G2). Complete wound closure could be achieved (Figure F) with long-term functional and esthetic outcome (Figure G).\\nPossibilities for local flaps at the foot include the reversed sural, dorsalis pedis, and abductor digiti minimi flaps. For free-flap anastomosis, recipient vessels are the anterior, posterior, peroneal, and dorsalis pedis artery with concomitant veins. The plantar surface requires a separate approach of exposure to high pressure during walking and mechanical stress. Here, an instep flap could be used as an option ().", "age": "[[81.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34122775': 1, '11078615': 1, '21200292': 1, '23352571': 1, '14707640': 1, '7834422': 1, '3737751': 1, '11135481': 1, '6371860': 1, '20213397': 1, '12072766': 1, '18407817': 1, '7661898': 1, '17061281': 1, '23351681': 1, '20555081': 1, '8113272': 1, '24691339': 1, '8664040': 1, '24763695': 1, '12743156': 1, '24740176': 1, '24947004': 1, '32065733': 1, '26793620': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4711341-1': 2, '4711341-2': 2, '4711341-3': 2}"}
