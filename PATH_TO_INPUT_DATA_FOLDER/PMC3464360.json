He was the first child of healthy unrelated parents. Routine second trimester ultrasound examination showed enlarged cerebral ventricles; amniocentesis was performed and a de novo balanced reciprocal translocation t(1;6)(p31;q25) was detected. The patient was born at term with a birth weight of 2450 g, birth length of 48 cm, and occipital frontal circumference (OFC) of 33 cm. He was hypotonic and had mild dysmorphic features. Developmental milestones were significantly delayed; he sat at the age of 2, walked at 21 /2, and spoke one to two words at the age of 3. Feeding problems and severe constipation were prominent from 6 months until 3 years of age. At the latest clinical examination, 8 years old, height was 120 cm, weight 21.8 kg, and OFC 54 cm. Dysmorphic features included a small triangular face, low hairline, micrognathia, small pointed chin, low-set large ears, broad nasal bridge and tip, concave curved thin vermilion of the upper lip, camptodactyly, and deep longitudinal plantar creases between first and second toes. He spoke only few words.
