BM revealed small-to-medium sized lymphoblasts comprising 92.4% of all nucleated cells. Immunochemical staining showed PAS+, MPO-, and ANBE-. Flow cytometric analysis revealed positivity for CD19, CD34, and TdT with aberrant CD33. Cytogenetic studies showed t(4;11)(q21;q23), which was further confirmed by FISH analysis. After induction chemotherapy, BM analysis revealed morphologic CR, however, FISH with the MLL-probe showed a signal in 5.5%. During chemotherapy, 2 months after initial diagnosis, the patient relapsed as AML M4. Blasts were positive for CD2, CD13, CD14, CD33, CD41, and CD65. FISH with the MLL probe showed a signal in 2%. Cytochemical staining showed positivity for MPO and ANBE. The patient underwent allo-HSCT four months after AML-directed chemotherapy. She remained in remission for 17 months following the second CR.", "age": "[[3.0, 'month']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16843104': 1, '22852088': 1, '17008890': 1, '29038614': 1, '2783859': 1, '1534389': 1, '28286501': 1, '31231669': 1, '26069209': 1, '28824851': 1, '24842350': 1, '11607819': 1, '6607471': 1, '12810259': 1, '2946333': 1, '6590097': 1, '20066454': 1, '7596149': 1, '15160929': 1, '19936875': 1, '12378533': 1, '26242204': 1, '11553058': 1, '8426196': 1, '16085566': 1, '34713888': 1, '21655072': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3102880-1': 2, '3102880-2': 2, '3102880-3': 2}"}
