She began to scratch the papule, and it gradually grew into a mass. Although she was treated with oral tranilast and a topical corticosteroid cream, the skin lesion never improved. Therefore, she was referred to our hospital. Clinical examination revealed a 70 \u00d7 65 mm mass on the both vertex and occipital region of the scalp (Figure A,B). As shown by trichoscopy, most of the hair ostia had disappeared. The results of a laboratory blood examination were unremarkable. Histological examination using samples obtained by a skin biopsy of the mass showed an obviously reduced number of HFs with an increased number of thickened collagen fibers that are characteristic of keloids (so-called \u201ckeloidal collagen\u201d) (Figure A,B). Interestingly, most of the fibroblasts were IL-6-positive, as shown by IL-6 immunohistochemistry (Figure C). Inflammatory cells were mainly lymphocytes, but histiocytes and plasma cells were also observed (Figure B). Multinucleated giant cells were also detected in the deep dermis (Figure D). Therefore, we diagnosed this case as AK. The patient's AK has remained stable in size by continuous oral treatment with tranilast and a topical corticosteroid cream.", "age": "[[44.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'29240822': 1, '17472675': 1, '24863570': 1, '33568929': 1, '3654037': 1, '17384473': 1, '17170717': 1, '16397521': 1, '15926654': 1, '31360500': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
