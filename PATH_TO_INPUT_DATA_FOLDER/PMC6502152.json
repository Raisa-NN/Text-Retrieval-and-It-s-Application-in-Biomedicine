Following a normal early psychomotor development, since 5 years of age he has started to toe walk, with constant, progressive difficulties in walking.\\nHis last neurological examination shows distal lower limbs hypertonus, bilaterally brisk tendon reflexes in his lower limbs and extensor plantar reflexes, no clonus, cavovarus supinated feet, postural/intention tremor in his upper limbs, hypotrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles and of the peroneal and extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) muscles. MRC muscle strength is mildly reduced (4/5) in the peroneal/extensor, thumb abductor/adductor, intrinsic and orbicularis oculi muscles. EMG/ENG shows a sensori-motor polyneuropathy in all four limbs.\\nThe patient has undergone serial, non-contributory diagnostic investigations, including brain and spine MRI, full ocular examination, audiometric evaluation, array-CGH, vitamin E dosage, urinary organic acids profile, molecular testing for SPG3A. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) in the lower limbs are in keeping with bilateral central conduction delay.", "age": "[[16.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16198564': 1, '24870368': 1, '14981520': 1, '30561392': 1, '31852952': 1, '19433282': 1, '10762521': 1, '19735987': 1, '22378671': 1, '20382840': 1, '26204789': 1, '11523566': 1, '17717711': 1, '12736090': 1, '34630290': 2, '21741240': 1, '19539237': 1, '30889162': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8493287-1': 1}"}
