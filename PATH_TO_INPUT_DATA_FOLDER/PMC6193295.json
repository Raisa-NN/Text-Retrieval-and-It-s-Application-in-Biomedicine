These symptoms developed without apparent causes and in the absence of other problems, such as ptosis, enophthalmus, fever, chest pain, breathlessness, cough, expectoration, nausea, or vomiting. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest revealed a 6.1 \u00d7 5.6 \u00d7 5.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass in the left posterior mediastinum (Fig. ). In addition, adjacent intervertebral foramen of thoracic vertebra became larger, and bone destruction of the left second rib can also be seen. Particularly, there was no enlarged lymph node within the mediastinum.\\nA left posterolateral thoracotomy through the fifth intercostal space was performed. During the surgery, it was found that the mass which was approximately 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 cm in size arose from the cortex of the second rib and was hard in consistency. Ossification could also be seen within the tumor. We resected the tumor completely and removed partial sclerotin on the surface of the second rib. Histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of chondroma (Fig. ). Her postoperative course was uneventful. She was discharged without any complication in 12 days after surgery. Follow-up high-resolution computed tomography scans have not detected recurrence 42 months after surgery.", "age": "[[31.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'2339945': 1, '22916761': 1, '34686095': 1, '15522561': 1, '17097430': 1, '3396292': 1, '30333040': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
