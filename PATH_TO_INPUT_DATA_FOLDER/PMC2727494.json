On examination, the patient was hemodynamically stable, but had no palpable lower extremity pulses on the injured side (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial). The ankle-brachial index confirmed an arterial injury (<0.9). On immediate exploration, a transacted superficial left femoral artery was identified. Following debridement of the contused ends of the vessel, as well as moderate mobilization, a primary repair was completed using the technique described. The patient was discharged home on post-operative day 3 with normal extremity function.", "age": "[[22.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17858758': 1, '29766105': 1, '15967910': 1, '13521671': 1, '25413177': 1, '9833811': 1, '19650926': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
