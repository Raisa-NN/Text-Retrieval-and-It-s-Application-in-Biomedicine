On clinical examination she had referred pain on bilateral palpation of the oropharynx. Cervical ultrasonographic evaluation was unremarkable. Eagle's syndrome was suspected. A cervical lateral radiograph showed an elongated styloid process (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) with axial (Fig. ), coronal (Fig. ), and three-dimensional (3D) volume-rendering CT images (Fig. ) showed complete ossification of the stylohyoid ligaments with pseudoarticulations. A lateral neck radiograph showed calcifications from the base of the skull to the hyoid bone. An external approach for the removal of the styloid processes was planned and resulted in complete relief of the patient's symptoms.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22664285': 1, '15041871': 1, '19240828': 1, '26015690': 1, '20558961': 1, '14564284': 1, '10214896': 1, '17997158': 1, '11562889': 1, '16320226': 1, '21213007': 2, '22244077': 1, '18771827': 1, '23031688': 2, '11815916': 1, '18083436': 1, '10958426': 1, '18790603': 1, '20339566': 1, '19621249': 1, '24198961': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3095808-1': 1, '3492092-1': 1}"}
