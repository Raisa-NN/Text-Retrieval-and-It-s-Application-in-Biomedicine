As her symptoms did not improve, she underwent brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a local hospital 6 days after onset. Brain CT and MRI revealed a mass with a cyst at the right temporal lobe. Therefore, subtotal tumor resection was performed 10 days after onset, and the resected brain tumor was diagnosed as anaplastic ependymoma. After the operation, postoperative radiation therapy (59.4 Gy/33 Fr, 1 month) was performed at our hospital, following which the patient was observed at the outpatient ward of the hospital. However, 8 years after the operation, the right temporal tumor recurred and was resected again. As postoperative neuroradiological analysis revealed complete resection of the tumor, she received no postoperative therapy but was followed up at the outpatient ward of the hospital. We observed no tumor recurrence 1 month after the second operation.", "age": "[[8.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26984744': 1, '14601094': 1, '12898159': 1, '12430711': 1, '21713151': 2, '19795492': 1, '18496143': 1, '11393080': 1, '20464403': 2, '31393268': 1, '22537657': 1, '12761644': 1, '30882396': 1, '23729320': 1, '30251576': 1, '22246925': 1, '19788053': 1, '16598485': 1, '27157931': 1, '10672330': 1, '33505691': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2892612-1': 1, '2892612-2': 1, '2892612-3': 1, '2892612-4': 1, '2892612-5': 1, '2892612-6': 1, '2892612-7': 1, '3111712-1': 1}"}
