Transthoracic echocardiography in parasternal and modified apical view showed a markedly dilated coronary sinus (Figures and ). There was no evidence of valvular heart disease and diameters of cardiac chambers were within normal limits. Systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle and estimated pulmonary systolic pressure were in normal range. All pulmonary veins drained into the left atrium. In order to reveal the cause of coronary sinus dilation an agitated saline injection was given into the left antecubital vein. The contrast entered first into the coronary sinus and subsequently appeared in the right atrium. Similarly, when the saline injection was given into the right antecubital vein, the contrast agent appeared first in the dilated coronary sinus and thereafter entered into the right atrium (Figure , ). Transesophageal echocardiography showed absence of right SVC, presence of left SVC at lateral border of left atrium and no evidence of any other structural abnormalities of the heart and great thoracic vessels (Figure ). An upper venous digital subtraction cavography confirmed the absence of the right SVC and the presence of persistent left SVC (Figure ). Surface electrocardiogram and laboratory exams were within normal limits. Abdominal sonography verified normal position and structure of visceral organs.", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30834055': 1, '22204758': 2, '3791336': 1, '8705772': 1, '29115093': 2, '465219': 1, '31440357': 2, '2629862': 1, '28491654': 1, '8840217': 1, '20049316': 2, '19214419': 1, '33976515': 1, '9566074': 1, '24757642': 2, '8053249': 1, '29652290': 2, '9417226': 1, '9230155': 1, '23204826': 1, '28637939': 1, '28357015': 2, '20532458': 2, '16438718': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2796441-1': 1, '5358287-1': 1, '6669301-1': 1, '5914229-1': 1, '3266648-1': 1, '5680510-1': 1, '3987451-1': 1, '5592325-1': 1}"}
