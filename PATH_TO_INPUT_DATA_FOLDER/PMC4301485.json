Previously, in 1986, at 35 years of age, the patient had undergone a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH+BSO) for a stage 1 grade 1 adult GCT of the ovary in the Second Hospital of Guangxi Province (Guilin, China). The patient did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy and remained disease-free until 2013. Upon admittance to hospital in 2013, the blood test for the \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) tumor marker was negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient was performed and reviewed. A 2.5-mm slightly enhancing mass was observed in the tumor of metastasis; the tumor was ~10\u00d715\u00d725 cm in size (). A biopsy was not obtained prior to surgery. Following the diagnosis of right PLC, surgery was performed. Recurrences were present on the right hemi-liver and jejunum, with sparse nodules. A radical hepatectomy involving segments 5/6, a cholecystectomy and a segmental jejunectomy were performed. Following the resection, the tissues were delivered to the Department of Pathology, and then embedded in paraffin and sectioned. The pathological results showed Call-Exner bodies as microfollicular structures and clear metastasis of the liver, with GCT of the ovary (). Immunhistochemistry results revealed positivite staining for CD56, CD99, inhibin-\u03b1 and S-100 and negative staining for CK19. The patient made a good recovery, with resolution of the previous abdominal pain, and remains disease-free at one year post-surgery.", "age": "[[62.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'34671531': 2, '12769214': 1, '18815151': 1, '3891073': 1, '29796312': 1, '30465009': 1, '18386473': 1, '22175649': 1, '29871662': 1, '21776915': 1, '32494954': 2, '2776109': 1, '17945423': 1, '32030011': 1, '21077485': 1, '32976259': 1, '15099981': 1, '18025802': 1, '25621056': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8520693-1': 1, '7270424-1': 1}"}
