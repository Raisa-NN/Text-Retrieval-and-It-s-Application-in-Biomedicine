Dyspnea was caused by left pleural effusion, hepatomegaly, and ascites. She understood her limited prognosis and decided that if the condition got worse she wanted to be at home. She previously received sustained release oxycodone 20 mg twice a day for pain from the hospital. To treat her dyspnea, palliative care team prescribed additional morphine immediate release 5 mg when necessary. Although the team tried to convince her of its benefits on 3 consecutive home visits, she did not take the morphine. At the first visit, she did explain that she did not take morphine because she was not sure how to take it. The team tried to describe in detail how to use morphine and a 5 mg morphine immediate release dose was tried. At the second visit, the team again discussed the benefits of morphine and described in detail how to use it. The third visit, 2 days later, she still had not used the morphine. She mentioned that she can tolerate the dyspnea. The palliative team suggested her to have a thoracentesis at the hospital.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20799902': 1, '18182991': 1, '16442483': 1, '20816546': 1, '20836633': 1, '20887501': 1, '32983967': 1, '20471543': 1, '18425927': 1, '16914301': 1, '20601209': 1, '12067684': 1, '12724429': 1, '20471544': 1, '10102851': 1, '9747545': 1, '18390468': 1, '9069607': 1, '19075206': 1, '16442481': 1, '20306274': 1, '20606848': 1, '19643827': 1, '20091630': 1, '16629572': 1, '18646110': 1, '16109163': 1, '10989248': 1, '9872857': 1, '21237709': 1, '11904785': 1, '18424030': 1, '23093829': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3477366-1': 2, '3477366-2': 2, '3477366-3': 2, '3477366-4': 2}"}
