On biopsy a diagnosis of desmoplastic small round cell tumour was suggested. A subsequently performed CT-scan showed extensive localization in the abdomen.\\nOrchidectomy was performed. Subsequently, following the diagnosis of DSRCT, the patient was treated with chemotherapy: three cycles VIDE: Vincristine 1 mg/m2, Etoposide 150 mg/m2, Doxorubicine 20 mg/m2, Ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2. After three cycles chemotherapy, an incomplete debulking procedure was performed and post-operatively another three cycles VIDE were administered. A complete resection was not possible, because of tumour extension in the abdomen. The patient returned back to work and was relatively well for one and a half year. Unfortunately the patient died 24 months later with progressive metastases in the liver and abdominal cavity.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9738572': 1, '16080179': 1, '15868593': 1, '10094185': 1, '8756380': 1, '12640103': 1, '9496834': 1, '30851735': 2, '8963628': 1, '17406243': 1, '28748349': 1, '7862627': 1, '12498718': 1, '8375856': 1, '9808124': 1, '32339108': 1, '10555010': 1, '12923058': 1, '17211792': 1, '15389255': 1, '11960373': 1, '17325488': 1, '14520438': 1, '17414105': 1, '18502632': 1, '2473463': 1, '9042290': 1, '9706984': 1, '12131150': 1, '9808123': 1, '16685737': 1, '15557784': 1, '19913282': 1, '16189150': 1, '15826834': 1, '1709557': 1, '16730884': 1, '9718171': 1, '22587803': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6409157-1': 1}"}
