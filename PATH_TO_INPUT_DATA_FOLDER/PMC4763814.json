Prenatal care\\nshowed no complications. She was born at a gestational age of 39 weeks, weighed 2625\\ng, and had no comorbid conditions. Baseline biochemical tests were consistent with\\ncholestatic syndrome. Serology for cytomegalovirus was negative. Abdominal ultrasound\\nrevealed a hypoplastic gallbladder and a liver with a normal aspect. Percutaneous\\nliver biopsy showed histopathological findings typical of BA. Exploratory laparotomy\\nat 10 weeks and 5 days old showed atresia of the extrahepatic bile duct system, an\\nintensely hypoplastic gallbladder, and an enlarged, firm, micronodular liver. After\\nsurgery, the infant progressed with partial improvement in clinical and laboratory\\nparameters. She was referred for liver transplantation, which was performed at\\nanother hospital, and was lost to follow-up afterward.", "age": "[[9.0, 'week'], [4.0, 'day']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'978315': 1, '19914515': 1, '8987001': 1, '20003142': 1, '21226614': 1, '23987231': 1, '15383852': 1, '16939755': 1, '9404961': 1, '8433241': 1, '1593379': 1, '21285868': 1, '15852270': 1, '19403492': 1, '11150445': 1, '26840713': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4763814-1': 2, '4763814-2': 2, '4763814-3': 2}"}
