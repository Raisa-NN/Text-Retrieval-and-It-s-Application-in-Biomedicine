Unusual lace-shaped bone growths were found all along the facial-vestibular side of the maxillary (Figure ). These growths had developed at the level of projection of apex of the dental roots. They appeared well-differentiated with a finely demarcated cortical bone (white arrows) covering a well-structured but rather loose cancellous bone (black stars). The density of this loose cancellous bone was sharply distinct from that of the more mechanically stressed cancellous bone (white stars) surrounding the dental roots.\\nCoronal oblique reconstructions (Figure ) and bony volume rendering views (Figure and ) illustrated the nodular appearance of these buccal exostoses (white arrows) giving to the global involvement a \u201cpearl necklace\u201d appearance.\\nThese asymptomatic exostoses were known by the patient for a long time and had developed for many years. The patient had no mandibular exostosis, nor mandibular or palatine tori.", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26028907': 2, '30972382': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4441241-1': 1}"}
