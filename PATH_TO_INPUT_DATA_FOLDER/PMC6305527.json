He was previously treated for a right-sided inguinal lymph nodal malignant fibrous histiocytoma and right-sided pelvic high-grade pleomorphic and spindle cell sarcoma 6 and 3 years earlier, respectively, via surgical excision in the orthopedic department and radiation therapy (adjuvant dose of 60 Gy/30 fractions to the pelvis) in the radiology department. He had no other underlying diseases such as hypertension or diabetes. The follow-up of the patient included biannual pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and chest CT and annual positron emission tomography (PET)-CT. No signs of recurrence or metastasis were identified until the currently described renal mass (Figure ).\\nFollowing a full metastatic work-up, the patient underwent open right-sided partial nephrectomy. Subsequent pathology revealed a tumor measuring 1.7 cm \u00d7 1.4 cm \u00d7 1.0 cm with a capsule abutting, leading to a diagnosis of a grade 2 ccpRCC without necrosis and a final pathologic stage of T1aN \u00d7 M0 (Figure ). The patient was routinely followed at the urology outpatient clinic without any further adjuvant plan for 9 mo postoperatively.", "age": "[[17.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21791489': 1, '26935559': 1, '22458901': 1, '26857533': 1, '25970682': 1, '21707708': 1, '22931041': 1, '16434887': 1, '25398389': 1, '24485757': 1, '20924276': 1, '18594469': 1, '24025519': 1, '25081542': 1, '24182559': 1, '23323104': 1, '31423203': 1, '19747356': 1, '23093565': 1, '23238627': 1, '30596034': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
