She had never previously received any treatment with glucocorticoids or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. At the same time as she developed tenderness in her right tibia, she also presented with fatigue, anorexia, and diffuse joint and muscle pains. At the time of evaluation for JDM, a radiograph and three-phase bone scan were performed looking for the cause of her tibial tenderness. The radiograph of her right tibia revealed thickening of the anterior cortex of the mid tibia. Furthermore, the three-phase bone scan showed a focal linear increased uptake along the lateral cortex of the proximal tibia bilaterally. There was no evidence of any soft tissue uptake. The findings of the radiograph and three-phase bone scan were consistent with stress fractures of both tibiae. When she was transferred to our hospital six months later, the fractures had already healed without additional treatment. A BMD scan looking at regional bone and both femoral necks was normal at the time of transferring her care to our hospital.", "age": "[[5.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11317015': 1, '8629827': 1, '28469488': 2, '9481588': 1, '7573660': 1, '29074476': 1, '29079590': 1, '15090396': 1, '28611915': 2, '11709618': 1, '11269816': 1, '21464375': 1, '27020068': 1, '14058330': 1, '19809896': 1, '8215620': 1, '21081210': 1, '32173660': 1, '23536179': 1, '28026207': 1, '12768465': 1, '6707039': 1, '28585373': 1, '30375573': 1, '33596941': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5390922-1': 1, '5393140-1': 1}"}
