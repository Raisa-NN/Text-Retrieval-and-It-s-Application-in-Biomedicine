He progressed to end-stage renal disease within 2 years and was initiated on HD at another center through a non-tunneled uncuffed left internal jugular catheter. He gave history of an attempted right internal jugular catheterization for HD 1 year ago at another center, but the procedure was unsuccessful. He had been undergoing intermittent HD through left radiocephalic fistula for the last 1 year. He was admitted in our center for pretransplant evaluation. Clinically he appeared poorly dialyzed, orthopneic, and pale. On physical examination, blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg, a diffuse thrill was felt, and a bruit heard in the right supraclavicular fossa; systemic examination was unremarkable. Doppler evaluation of neck showed dilated right internal jugular vein with hyperdynamic circulation exhibiting biphasic wave pattern. An angiogram was done which showed an abnormal connection between the thyrocervical branch of right subclavian artery and right internal jugular vein, resulting in dilatation of the internal jugular vein []. Feeder artery was embolized using multiple 035 and 018 coils []. Check angiogram after the procedure showed collapse of the fistulous track [] and follow-up angiogram after 48 h shows that the arteriovenous fistula has been completely closed.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9198057': 1, '9929539': 1, '10834488': 1, '10532209': 1, '26430400': 1, '3947185': 1, '9370185': 1, '11886371': 1, '7984193': 1, '7573193': 1, '25120297': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
