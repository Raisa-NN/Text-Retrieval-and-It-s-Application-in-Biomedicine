He had no significant medical or surgical history, was not on medications, and did not have a smoking history, recent travel history, or prolonged period of immobilization. There was no family history of malignancy.\\nOn examination, he was mildly tachycardic at 110 beats per minute but regular, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. He was tachypnoeic at 16 breaths per minute but afebrile. The remainder of his clinical examination was normal. A pulmonary embolus was suspected clinically and a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was performed demonstrating multifocal filling defects in the pulmonary arterial system in both lungs mostly in the lower lobes confirming the diagnosis of acute bilateral pulmonary embolism (Figure ). No complicating pulmonary infarction was seen on CT. He was admitted to the hospital and treated initially with subcutaneous enoxaparin injections and was commenced on warfarin.\\nDuring his hospital admission, he was investigated for a cause of pulmonary embolism and serologic screening tests for coagulopathy including anti-thrombin III, Protein C, and Protein S deficiency were negative. A bilateral lower limb duplex ultrasound scan was then requested. Although no deep vein thrombosis was identified in the lower limb and pelvic veins including the lower inferior vena cava, a mass measuring 4.9 \u00d7 3.0 cm was identified in the root of the mesentery (Figure ). Subsequent CT of the abdomen after administration of oral and intravenous contrast (Figure ) confirmed a solitary soft tissue attenuating mass in the mid abdomen. No central necrosis or calcification was identified.\\nThe patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission and he declined further investigations and procedures. As the international normalized ratio was therapeutic (2\u20133) at that stage, he was discharged home and was organized to have an F-18 FDG PET/CT and follow-up in the outpatient clinic. The F-18 FDG PET/CT a month later confirmed the mass was solitary and was intensely avid with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 6.6 (Figure ). The patient again declined intervention or biopsy at that stage, as he remained well clinically. A follow-up F-18 FDG PET/CT was scheduled 6 months later, which showed a mild increase in metabolic activity of the mass (SUVmax 8.5,) but no change in size anatomically. The patient remained clinically asymptomatic, but given the mild increase in metabolic activity, there was increasing concern of a malignancy and the patient subsequently agreed to a laparoscopic excision biopsy. The procedure was uneventful and the mass was completely excised with clear and negative margins. No lymphadenopathy elsewhere was identified intraoperatively. Histologic analysis confirmed the mass corresponded to a pathologically enlarged lymph node. It showed an increased number of variably sized, significantly enlarged follicles throughout the lymph node with the germinal centers in larger follicles showing irregular blurred margins. There was obvious infiltration and accumulation of the mantle zone lymphocytes within the larger follicles on the CD79a stain with BCL2 negativity, thus excluding follicular lymphoma. Flow cytometry studies showed no evidence of a monoclonal population or evidence of light chain restriction (Figure ). L&H cells and classical Reed-Sternberg-like cells were absent. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of PTGC was made.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16886280': 1, '2405631': 1, '21614317': 2, '1084635': 1, '29348956': 2, '21892026': 1, '12242134': 1, '1574490': 1, '22707034': 1, '23228169': 1, '6496841': 1, '26061300': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5733901-1': 1, '3097690-1': 1}"}
