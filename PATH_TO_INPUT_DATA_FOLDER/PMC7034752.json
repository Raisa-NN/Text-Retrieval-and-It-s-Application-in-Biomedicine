The lesion was tracked and recorded for approximately two years and has been gradually growing in size. The mass has never been drained and has never been infected.\\nThe patient is otherwise healthy and has reported no fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting. As medical student in Antigua with decreased access to medical care, he decided to seek surgical intervention due to recent mild discomfort.\\nFurther clinical examination confirmed a circumference of 1 cm for the cystic lesion. Physical exam revealed no fluctuance, pericystic erythema, or any tenderness to palpation. Excision was planned for one week after the initial consultation.\\nThe procedure was performed in an outpatient setting under local anesthesia. The patient was injected with 4 ml of local 1% lidocaine with epinephrine subcutaneously surrounding the 1 cm lesion. An elliptical incision was marked and carried out to excise the cystic lesion in a single specimen piece. The entire cystic lesion was subsequently sent for pathological analysis. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\\nThe pathology report confirmed an excision of tan-brown skin lesion, measuring 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. The cutaneous surface was remarkable for a central 0.8 x 0.6 cm gray-tan, slightly raised, firm nodule.\\nHistopathological examination of the excised cystic lesion revealed a moderately cellular, poorly demarcated, dermal, fibrohistiocytic proliferation made primarily of fusiform to stellate cells with unvarying, oval nuclei and amphiphilic cytoplasm (Figure ), associated with intralesional pools of extravasated blood and peripheral collagen trapping. Multinucleated giant cells with peripheral cytoplasmic deposits of hemosiderin were also observed in a scattered formation (Figure ). A diagnosis of HDF was confirmed.", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'28927449': 1, '26236411': 1, '23176079': 1, '21747617': 1, '25398793': 1, '28225963': 2, '33768851': 2, '29881552': 2, '23866059': 1, '24937822': 1, '22792102': 1, '22996372': 1, '6261935': 1, '16433792': 1, '27465194': 1, '15458535': 1, '32133258': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7981605-1': 1, '5986033-1': 1, '5312185-1': 1}"}
