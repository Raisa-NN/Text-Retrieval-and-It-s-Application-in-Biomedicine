He was not a known diabetic and was a non-smoker. On presentation, electrocardiography (ECG) was done which showed ST elevation in inferior leads along with sinus bradycardia with heart rate in 30\u2019s. He was taken emergently to the catheterization lab, where it was found that he had complete occlusion of distal right coronary artery (RCA) along with 80% stenosis of proximal RCA, resulting in the placement of three drug-eluting stents to the above (Figure ).\\nIncidentally, multiple coronary artery aneurysms were also noted at that time. He was started on aspirin and clopidogrel for coronary artery disease status post stenting and was discharged home once he was medically stable.\\nHe presented again to the emergency room, a month later with complaints of substernal chest tightness of 2 hours duration and ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 56 and anterior ST elevation, was taken again emergently to the catheterization lab for left heart catheterization and found to have distal RCA stent thrombosis and underwent successful coronary angioplasty. He informed that he was only taking clopidogrel, hence stent thrombosis was thought to be from non-adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy. After discharge from the hospital, he started noticing progressively worsening severe bilateral lower extremity pain along with gangrenous appearing little toes of both feet and dusky appearance of remaining toes (Figure ).\\nLower extremity arterial doppler was negative, which ruled out peripheral vascular disease. So, in suspicion of ongoing vascular disease, CT angiogram of the abdominal aorta was done which showed 1.6 cm right common iliac artery aneurysm along with 1 cm saccular aneurysm at the origin of the superior mesenteric artery but with no significant vessel narrowing or presence of emboli (Figures , ).\\nConsidering the peripheral artery aneurysms and coronary aneurysms, differentials included sequelae of Kawasaki disease along with systemic vasculitis and was referred to rheumatology.\\nLab investigations showed negative serologies including ANCA and antinuclear antibody. Markers of inflammation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 31 mm/hr and C-reactive protein was normal along with normal complement levels and hepatitis serologies. After excluding viral causes - including hepatitis B and C and HIV - the patient was started on immunosuppressive therapy with oral prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg, which he took for a brief period with improvement in gangrenous symptoms, and was eventually tapered off. He was also planned to be started on maintenance therapy with cyclophosphamide but had issues with approval from his insurance and could not afford to buy the medication. Other alternative options were discussed, but the patient was not inclined as his symptoms improved. Considering his presentation, it is believed he has underlying systemic vasculitis such as polyarteritis nodosa.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22687865': 1, '23731050': 1, '19946711': 1, '12796415': 1, '23754739': 1, '10845504': 1, '1674424': 1, '12784413': 1, '10693883': 1, '27853042': 2, '28397742': 1, '17183613': 1, '18560943': 1, '33936904': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5394819-1': 1}"}
