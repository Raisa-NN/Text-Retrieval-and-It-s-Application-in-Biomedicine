She developed left knee pain and swelling. In view of suspected PPI, she was referred for three phase bone scintigraphy. Blood pool phase showed increased tracer pooling in the left knee region []. Delayed whole body images show increased uptake in the left knee prosthetic bone interface []. Whole body Tc99m-UBI scintigraphy showed pooling of tracer in the same area of left knee region as in bone scintigraphy []. Static images of knee joint at 2 h showed interval increase in pooling of tracer []. 18F fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (F-18 FDG PET/CT) images of the knee joint also show increased uptake in the left knee prosthesis-bone interface []. In view of increased uptake in all three scans, scan findings suggestive of infection were raised. Patient underwent debridement of the prosthesis, and bacterial culture was positive. She was started on antibiotics.", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'25071885': 1, '10155161': 1, '10098033': 1, '23652406': 1, '22692421': 1, '17334764': 1, '14973416': 1, '16595481': 1, '12900285': 1, '19038601': 1, '24196917': 1, '7758501': 1, '15274264': 1, '19182727': 1, '21659909': 1, '15809477': 1, '26170572': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
