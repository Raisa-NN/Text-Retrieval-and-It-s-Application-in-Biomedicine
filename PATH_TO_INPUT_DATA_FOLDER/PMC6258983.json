In the medial canthopexy procedure, the Mitek bone anchor system was used for fixation. For lateral canthopexy, a tarsal strip procedure with a suspension suture was performed. Additionally, she had unilateral eyebrow ptosis and combined lagophthalmos; thus, we performed gold plate insertion and brow lift procedures. At 6 months postoperatively, her ectropion had resolved without recurrence ().\\nNo major complications such as infections or secondary entropion occurred. There was one case of recurrent ectropion, but it resolved after an additional canthopexy procedure, and the stability of the outcome was confirmed at a 1-year postoperative follow-up.", "age": "[[69.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'2705933': 1, '12832900': 1, '11148701': 1, '12756124': 1, '18470835': 1, '10326005': 1, '508189': 1, '15622256': 1, '25050757': 1, '30840813': 1, '10359271': 1, '34232357': 1, '18182953': 1, '21277065': 1, '8700992': 1, '20590414': 1, '21993579': 1, '29506332': 1, '32971590': 1, '30466232': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6258983-1': 2, '6258983-2': 2}"}
