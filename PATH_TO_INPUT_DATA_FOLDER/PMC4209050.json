Neurologic consultation led to a diagnosis of polyneuropathy of uncertain etiology, likely paraneoplastic in origin. Her past medical history included hypothyroidism and idiopathic sensory neuronopathy (both of at least fifteen years duration), pernicious anemia, oculopharyngeal dystrophy, arterial hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and appendectomy. She had stopped smoking forty years previously.\\nAs part of a subsequent \u201cneoplastic workup\u201d a PET-scan revealed a highly metabolically active mass in the cecum, with no other sites suspicious for neoplasia identified. A CT-scan of the thorax was negative. She was not anemic, and stated she was completely asymptomatic regarding the cecal lesion. An attempt at colonoscopic biopsy was unsuccessful, as, due to pain and significant diverticulosis, the colonoscope could not be passed beyond the sigmoid. Shortly thereafter, a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed.\\nPostoperatively, the patient received standard chemotherapy for colorectal carcinoma. Nearly one year following surgery, there is no evidence of recurrent disease. Her polyneuropathy has resolved.", "age": "[[75.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'34327072': 2, '20811712': 1, '17146588': 1, '22918886': 1, '22826789': 1, '10561306': 1, '31845183': 2, '15762280': 1, '20214618': 1, '14561798': 1, '25338547': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8301270-1': 1, '7394999-1': 1}"}
