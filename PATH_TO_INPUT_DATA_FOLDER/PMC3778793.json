Four weeks prior to presentation, she had been initiated on lamotrigine at 25 mg/day, which was rapidly increased to 50 mg BD over 2 weeks and 100 mg BD over another 2 weeks, at which time she developed skin rash and oral erosions. Examination revealed a rash typical of toxic epidermal necrolysis with erythematous macules, papules, flaccid blisters, targetoid lesions, and erosions over face, trunk and palms involving around 30% of body surface area []. Nikolsky's sign was positive. Genital and oral erosions with hemorrhagic crusting over lips and severe conjunctival congestion were observed. Systemic examination was unremarkable. A causality assessment of this adverse event revealed a probable association between lamotrigine and toxic epidermal necrolysis based on the Naranjo probability scale.[] Blood counts and basic biochemistry were normal. Lamotrigine and other drugs, except valproic acid, were stopped. She was given prednisolone 40 mg/day, in addition to supportive care. Prednisolone was tapered gradually, and the patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged.", "age": "[[26.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9798758': 1, '9674940': 1, '16499755': 1, '33688237': 1, '10403224': 1, '17484761': 1, '25957602': 1, '25327504': 1, '11092611': 1, '8628341': 1, '17502552': 1, '26173940': 1, '29166503': 1, '33294176': 2, '17386054': 1, '7249508': 1, '24082198': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3778793-1': 2, '7691122-1': 1}"}
