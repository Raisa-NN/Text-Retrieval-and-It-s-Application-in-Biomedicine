He had no trauma. The patient had bilateral hypoesthesia in the L2-L3-L4-L5 region and VAS for back pain was 9. A neurologic examination revealed a condition of paraparesis. The strength of knee flexion and extension was grade 3 bilaterally, the hip flexion was grade 3 bilaterally and the ankle flexion and extension was grade 4. The blood test revealed no alterations. MRI of the thoracic spine revealed a wide lesion in the dorsal epidural space with compression of the epidural sac at the T6-T7 level (). Twelve hours after admission the patient underwent decompression surgery, through a posterior approach with laminectomy at T7 level. After removing the ligamentum flavum, a large amount of disc material migrated into the dorsal epidural space was found (). After the removal of herniated fragment (), the dural sac showed no more signs of compression (). In the first post-operative day, the patient had good pain relief (VAS back 3) and showed prompt neurological recovery. The patient was discharged five days after surgery and at the one-month follow-up evaluation he was pain-free, with no hypoesthesia or motor weakness.", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9507629': 1, '11563623': 1, '27593745': 1, '29017311': 2, '33145226': 2, '32754350': 2, '16934732': 1, '30555647': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6287128-1': 2, '5642095-1': 1, '7591192-1': 1, '7395527-1': 1, '7395527-2': 1, '7395527-3': 1}"}
