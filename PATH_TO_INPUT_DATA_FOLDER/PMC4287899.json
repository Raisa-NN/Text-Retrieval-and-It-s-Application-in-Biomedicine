On neurological examination, she exhibited a sensory level at T4 with a spastic paraparesis and bilateral (right greater than left) muscle atrophy.[] The MR revealed a ventral dural gap at the T4 level [Figure \u2013]. She underwent a T4 laminectomy at which time the ventral dural gap was repaired (e.g. ventral dura mater defect repaired utilizing a 5-0 prolene suture to attach a muscle/fascia patch to the surrounding healthy dura mater) and the cord was reduced [] at surgery. The herniated cord appeared \u201cviolaceous/pale\u201d in color and was hardened []. Postoperatively, the patient showed improvement in muscle strength in the lower limbs, allowing her to walk with assistance (with a cane or walker).", "age": "[[66.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9726480': 1, '19240564': 1, '18976174': 1, '28955299': 2, '4424434': 1, '32101990': 1, '15347010': 1, '20515360': 1, '16284547': 1, '19769512': 1, '15596780': 1, '7815118': 1, '32861240': 1, '16506460': 1, '9452246': 1, '25593778': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5601982-1': 1, '5601982-2': 1}"}
