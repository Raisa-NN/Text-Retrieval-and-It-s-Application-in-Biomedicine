Parents reported that the child was scratching and damaging his various body parts since the age of 2 years. The child incessantly kept scratching his skin even during sleep to produce deeper abrasions and ulcerations. Parents denied any history of any itchy skin disease in other close family members. Cutaneous examination showed deep ulcers with secondary infection over dorsum of feet and hands, ears, nape of neck and thighs ranging in size from 2 to 6 cm [Figures and ]. These ulcers were present only over the areas which were easily accessible for scratching. There was no focus of any parasitic infestation or features suggestive of atopic eczema. A pediatric and psychiatric opinion was sought for his abnormal behavior. His detailed systemic evaluation revealed delayed developmental milestones, difficulty in social interaction, head banging and aggression along with attention deficit making him a school dropout.\\nHis routine blood biochemistry was normal except for low hemoglobin level (8.1 g/dl) and higher normal uric acid level (9.48 mg/dl). The child was treated with broad spectrum antibiotic (syrup amoxicillin trihydrate/potassium-clavulanate; 125 mg/5 ml) three times daily for infected ulcers along with regular dressings. The child was prescribed oral allopurinol (4 mg/kg) to suppress uric acid production. To prevent further self-mutilation, parents were taught various techniques of physical restraints (elbow guard, dental guard, etc).", "age": "[[3.5, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22198833': 1, '18974538': 1, '18287946': 1, '17225873': 1, '18067674': 1, '21988194': 1, '19259384': 1, '19565499': 1, '26120162': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
