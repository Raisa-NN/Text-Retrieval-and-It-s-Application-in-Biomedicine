Pain was localized on the right side, altered with change in position, and did not relate to any particular organ. Physical examination and urine analysis were normal. The patient had been treated successfully for bilateral grade 2 VUR when she was 3 years old. A kidney ureter bladder (KUB) radiography was requested and the report indicated presence of bilateral ureteral stone []. Ultrasonography showed bilateral ureterovesical junction (UVJ) stone and mild stasis in both kidneys, which was compatible with the findings of the non-enhanced spiral abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan []. However, diethylene triamine pentaacaetic acid (DTPA) scan with furosemide injection and radionuclide cystography (RNC) scan ruled out obstruction and relapse of VUR. Calcification of bilateral intravesical collagen injected to treat her VUR 12 years earlier was responsible for the positive findings on KUB, ultrasonography, and spiral CT. The patient was referred to the physiotherapist for her low back pain. The pain improved with treatment.", "age": "[[15.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17482948': 1, '22819104': 1, '7609186': 1, '8021986': 1, '24991478': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
