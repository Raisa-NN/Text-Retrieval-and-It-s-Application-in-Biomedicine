He was referred to the Department of Nuclear Medicine for Tc-99m MDP bone scan. Physical examination was unremarkable, and no focal tender area could be elicited. Whole-body bone scintigraphy was performed (Infinia Hawkeye with SPECT-CT). Scan showed rounded area of photopenia in the sternal body [Figures and ]. CT scan was done which showed defect in the sternum in lower one-third [Figures and ]. Volume rendered images clearly show sternal foramina []. The differential diagnosis of such a lesion consists of an osteolytic lesion, superposition of a necklace, or a congenital variation. CT scan of the sternum was performed, showing a midline circular defect of the sternal body-sternal foramen. Thus while reporting oncology bone scans, it should be noted that photopenic defects might attribute to congenital variations also, not just osteolytic lesions.", "age": "[[37.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'3989043': 1, '3239556': 1, '424534': 1, '7723561': 1, '30713377': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
