Additionally detected was hypertension, with an ankle-arm index <1 (pressure in the right arm=162/75 mmHg and pressure in the right leg=129/76 mmHg) and no substantial decrease in the femoral pulses. All these findings were in favor of coarctation of the aorta.\\nAll the other tests performed to investigate the other underlying causes of secondary hypertension were normal. In the initial investigation, the anteroposterior view of chest X-ray showed the straightening of the upper part of the left cardiac border (secondary to the parallel transposition of the great artery), the absence of the main pulmonary trunk, and normal pulmonary vascularization. Electrocardiography revealed the sinus rhythm, signs of right atrial enlargement, Q waves in leads III and aVF, the mean cardiac axis in the frontal plane between 0\u00ba and \u221230\u00ba, and a poor R progression in the precordial leads, all denoting the probability of cc-TGA.\\nTransthoracic echocardiography was performed; and as is shown in , atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial discordance was patently visible in the 4-chamber view. The aortic valve was bicuspid without a significant pressure gradient (). Aortic coarctation distal to the left subclavian artery was seen through the suprasternal window, with a maximum Doppler gradient of 60 mmHg. Additionally, mild tricuspid regurgitation was noted, with no intracardiac shunts.\\nValsartan (80 mg) and carvedilol (6.25 mg) were prescribed for the patient. Subsequently, for better evaluation, cardiac catheterization was done and its results confirmed the diagnosis of cc-TGA. Aortic root angiography demonstrated aortic coarctation distal to the emergence of the left subclavian artery (). There was a gradient of around 80 mmHg across the coarctation, without any intracardiac shunting or significant valvular regurgitation.\\nWith regard to the patient\u2019s symptoms and the significant gradient of the coarctation site, transarterial coarctoplasty was done for him. After the wiring of the coarctation, a CP stent (Cheatham\u2013Platinum stent) 8Z39 was deployed and postdilation was done using a Balloon-in-Balloon (BIB) (20\u00d750 mm) with good results (gradient across the coarctation site=0) and without complications (). The patient\u2019s blood pressure was controlled with medical treatment, and echocardiography at the time of discharge and 6 months afterward showed the proper position of the aortic coarctation stent in the aorta, with a turbulent flow and a gradient of 25 mmHg without diastolic tail. The abdominal aorta had an antegrade diastolic flow.", "age": "[[22.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21955471': 1, '21569592': 1, '25298707': 1, '30370391': 1, '15478325': 1, '20376185': 2, '19840081': 1, '13747591': 1, '21435186': 1, '27531082': 1, '998526': 1, '29378757': 1, '32742289': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2847868-1': 1}"}
