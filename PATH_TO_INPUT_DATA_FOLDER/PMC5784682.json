She stayed in the NICU for 2 months and was diagnosed with perimembranous ventricular septal defect. She was noticed to have global developmental delay and poor growth. There was no history of seizures. The parents are not consanguineous. There is no family history of a similar problem. Her physical examination was notable for microcephaly (7 SD below the mean). Her weight was -5SD and height was -3SD. She had low anterior hair line, squint, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, and micrognathia. The muscle tone was mildly increased in the upper and lower extremities. Ultrasound of abdomen showed mild right upper pole caliectasis.\\nMolecular cytogenetic analysis revealed presence of 2.78 Mb interstitial deletion in the short arm of chromosome 2 (extending between 59,170,950 bp and 61, 946, 784 bp over chromosome 2p16.1 deletion syndrome region) (Fig. ). Although the region is large in size, it is relatively gene-poor region with a total of only 27 genes, six of which are OMIM-annotated. Among these PEX13 is known to associate with Zellweger syndrome.", "age": "[[4.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23190751': 1, '23920044': 1, '17384091': 1, '22078432': 1, '3874587': 1, '22449124': 1, '20934504': 1, '3585947': 1, '25847113': 1, '19596467': 1, '16957476': 1, '23782710': 1, '22180640': 1, '25979662': 1, '23913520': 1, '16770806': 1, '23342975': 1, '18505455': 1, '12525543': 1, '27410714': 1, '10999840': 1, '24323407': 1, '1442882': 1, '24279697': 2, '20206336': 1, '12687502': 1, '27841880': 1, '22214275': 1, '22290657': 1, '21834047': 1, '27708715': 2, '21998857': 1, '9219000': 1, '7894733': 1, '18278044': 1, '27568866': 1, '23498568': 1, '21844811': 1, '21841781': 1, '20307858': 1, '23220431': 1, '21430780': 1, '22213401': 1, '26150740': 1, '21321151': 1, '16474404': 1, '17519398': 1, '23711909': 1, '18496225': 1, '20466091': 1, '24650298': 2, '18978679': 1, '19915526': 1, '9630079': 1, '27182706': 1, '12084585': 1, '24192140': 1, '23599694': 1, '914282': 1, '23272938': 1, '14517949': 1, '17090394': 1, '18790721': 1, '21248749': 1, '17873649': 1, '19844260': 1, '20522426': 1, '29416564': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5784682-1': 2, '5784682-2': 2, '5784682-3': 2, '5784682-4': 2, '5784682-5': 2, '5050589-1': 1, '3906914-1': 1, '4022390-1': 1}"}
