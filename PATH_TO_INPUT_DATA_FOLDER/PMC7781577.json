She complained of pain, swelling and a deformity of the right wrist. Active movements of the wrist were painful.\\nClinical examination revealed a swelling and deformity of her right wrist. Wrist movements were limited by pain. Clinically, there were no injuries to the neurological or vascular structures. There were no external injuries. Standard antero-posterior and lateral radiographs of the wrist were performed. The X-rays showed physeal injuries to both the distal radius as well as the ulna (Figure ). Near-total displacement in the dorsal direction was noted. It was initially graded as Type 1 Salter-Harris injury, but post reduction X-rays showed a clear metaphyseal involvement similar to a type 2 injury (Figure ).\\nThe patient was taken up for closed reduction on the same day. Under anesthesia, the epiphyseal fracture was reduced with longitudinal traction. Minimal and gentle manipulation was done to reduce both the radial and ulnar epiphysis. The ulnar epiphysis needed gentle manipulation. The ulnar epiphysis was reduced with gentle extension and traction, followed by palmar pressure. C-arm images were acceptable. The fluoroscopic images showed instability in the ulnar fracture. Both the fractures were stabilized with smooth 1.2 mm K-wires. The arm was protected in an above elbow plaster slab. At the time of submitting this article, the patient was two weeks post-operation. The post-operative period has been uneventful.", "age": "[[12.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8742284': 1, '2056079': 1, '3680332': 1, '19034390': 1, '2295168': 1, '33409082': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
