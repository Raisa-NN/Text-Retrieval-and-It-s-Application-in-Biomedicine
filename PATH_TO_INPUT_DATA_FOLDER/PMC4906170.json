On clinical examination, extraorally, there was generalized bilateral facial atrophy with loss of muscle and fat (Figures and ). On detailed questioning, he disclosed history of chewing fresh areca nut 4-5 times a day for 20 years with symptoms of burning sensation, progressive restriction in mouth opening, and intolerance to hot and spicy food for 10 yrs. He was advised to go for surgical intervention but due to financial constraints he opted for conservative treatments that included use of antioxidants and intralesional injection of steroids; however, he discontinued the treatment abruptly and drastically limited his frequency of areca nut consumption. Intraoral examination revealed palpable bilateral fibrous bands on the buccal mucosa, thin lips, trismus of 3 cm (), and absence of puffed cheek appearance while blowing. Recent bouts of sleeplessness for 1 yr compelled him to visit a neurologist who advised him to have brain MRI. To our surprise, MRI reported cerebral and cerebellum atrophy with ischemic changes (). Incisional biopsy of the buccal mucosa showed OSMF with moderately advanced epithelial dysplasia.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23107623': 1, '25006276': 1, '8636640': 1, '27891262': 1, '6647042': 1, '25780538': 1, '18940512': 1, '24393688': 1, '27339711': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
