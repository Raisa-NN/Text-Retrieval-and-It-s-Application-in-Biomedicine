He had had two episodes of hemoptysis in the last 2 days. There was no history of fever or cough. The patient gave a history of congenital heart disease but no history of past surgery or long-term medications for the same. On examination, blood pressure was 120/92 mm Hg, heart rate was 110 bpm, and SpO2 was 88% on room air and 95% on O2. He had central cyanosis and bilateral upper and lower limb clubbing. Blood workup revealed polycythemia with hemoglobin of 19.3 g/dL, hematocrit of 57.4%, mean corpuscular volume of 92.9 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) of 31.2 pg, and MCH concentration of 33.6 g/dL. Platelet count was reduced (84,000 mcL). Chest radiograph [] was reported as normal. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia and right-axis deviation. Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography (CTPA) ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism []. CT lung window (not shown) showed a wedge-shaped peripheral area of ground glassing with some consolidation in the right lower lobe of lung, suggestive of possible viral (?COVID-19) pneumonia. However, the patient tested negative for COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.", "age": "[[31.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26457208': 2, '14557509': 1, '27166350': 1, '17576876': 1, '34472532': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4589611-1': 1}"}
