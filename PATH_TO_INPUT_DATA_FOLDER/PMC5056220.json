Seventeen months earlier, he had been diagnosed as having RP due to bilateral auricular chondritis and scleritis. He had several flare-ups and had been treated irregularly. On cerebrospinal fluid examination, WBC count was 18 /mm3 (lymphocyte 74%, PMN 5%), glucose 66.8 mg/dL, and protein were 34.2 mg/dL. Serologic tests including ANA, ANCA, and RF were negative. Brain MR was checked and diffuse mild atrophy of cerebrum was noted but no abnormal signal was observed. PET CT was performed and showed symmetrically decreased FDG uptake in temporal lobe and cerebellum (). Dementia due to aseptic meningitis from RP was suspected. The patient was treated with high dose steroid and methotrexate, and azathioprine was combined consequently. Despite the treatments his symptoms deteriorated and dysphasia, loss of orientation, and behavioral change followed in a few months. As his condition did not improve, he gave up treatment and became lost to follow up.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21622521': 1, '32944685': 1, '25741046': 1, '24556284': 1, '14601695': 1, '34128872': 2, '30402308': 2, '15489409': 1, '33752456': 1, '16935282': 1, '20621534': 1, '775252': 1, '29245173': 1, '16832629': 1, '30426814': 2, '19716567': 1, '30402273': 1, '17393998': 1, '28480667': 1, '25743018': 1, '18208859': 1, '24881747': 1, '25729816': 1, '17043472': 1, '16044206': 1, '21869705': 1, '22051026': 1, '31043550': 1, '19834279': 1, '27709866': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5056220-1': 2, '5056220-2': 2, '6192138-1': 1, '6300954-1': 1, '8213297-1': 1}"}
