She denied any tenderness, pain or bleeding. Physical examination revealed mobile, elevated, indurated left lateral mass, not attached to the deep planes measuring 3 cm in length in close proximity to the anal verge. At this time the decision to undergo excision and biopsy was made. Under general anesthesia the perianal region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The anal mass was identified. The skin around the mass was injected with Marcaine 25% local anesthetic. An ellipitical incision was made around the mass approximately 0.5 cm from the mass edge. The subcutaneous tissue was taken down with electrocautery and the mass was completely removed without complications and sent for pathology. The skin was closed using interrupted subcuticular stiches and Monocryl. Pathology revealed a S100 positive immunostaining pattern with positive and negative controls leading to a diagnosis of GCT (Fig. a and b).", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11052524': 1, '20886343': 1, '23856985': 1, '15285042': 1, '19856672': 1, '212257': 1, '24444268': 1, '12610463': 1, '21430904': 1, '28603602': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
