The patient complained of bloody discharge. He had no other remarkable history besides hypertension and bronchiectasis. We performed punch biopsy of the crusted center of the mass. The histological findings showed eosinophilic irregularly shaped masses in the dermis infiltrated by inflammatory cells, atypical keratinocytes, and pleomorphic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. The lesion was suggestive of SCC, so it was excised completely. Histologically, the excised lesion showed infiltrating infundibular canals and radiating cords characterized by atypical keratinocytes with pleomorphism, hyperchromatism, minimal mitosis, dyskeratosis, and keratin pearls in the dermis. There were also multiple cysts filled with laminated keratin (). One month after excision of the lesion, the patient received postoperative external beam radiotherapy for 2 months and has not exhibited recurrence for 3 and half years.", "age": "[[72.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18360115': 1, '14675281': 1, '15699645': 1, '21937907': 1, '23689696': 1, '22505043': 1, '26082591': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
