Over 2 months before presentation at our hospital, the patient\u2019s\\njaundice of the skin and sclera increased, and he gradually developed abdominal\\ndistension, loss of appetite, and urine volume reduction. Liver transplantation was\\nrecommended. The patient was depressed (since the onset of disease) and showed a urine\\nvolume of 400 to 500 mL/day, a slight cough, white, sticky phlegm, and no fever.\\nExamination on admission showed the following results: temperature, 37.0\u00b0C; pulse,\\n120 beats/minute; respiration, 16 breaths/minute; blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; and body\\nweight, 65 kg. The patient was noted to be conscious, with severe jaundice of the skin and\\nsclera. He had clear breathing sounds in both lungs, and no dry or wet rales. There were\\nno abnormalities on cardiac examination. Abdominal distension was noted, which showed a\\npositive shifting dullness sign. Laboratory examinations provided the following results:\\nhemoglobin, 96 g/L (normal, 120\u2013160 g/L); platelet count, 80 \u00d7 109/L (normal,\\n100\u2013300 \u00d7 109/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 87.1 U/L (normal, 8\u201340 U/L);\\ntotal bilirubin, 547.4 \u00b5mol/L (normal, 1.71\u201317.1 \u00b5mol/L); direct bilirubin, 359.7 \u00b5mol/L\\n(normal, 1.71\u20137.0 \u00b5mol/L); albumin, 24.2 g/L (normal, 40\u201355 g/L); prothrombin time, 36.4 s\\n(normal, 11\u201314 s); activated partial thromboplastin time, 65.2 s (normal, 26\u201336 s);\\ninternational normalized ratio, 3.63 (normal, 0.8\u20131.2); and procalcitonin, 1.34 ng/mL\\n(normal, 0\u20130.5 ng/mL). Serum creatinine and blood ammonia levels were normal. A computed\\ntomography (CT) scan indicated cirrhosis, liver volume reduction, and ascites. Chest X-ray\\nindicated small amounts of pleural effusion.\\nOn day 3 after admission, the patient underwent piggyback orthotopic liver\\ntransplantation. The donated liver was from an ICU patient who had a fever, and his sputum\\nculture presented Acinetobacter baumannii. The operation lasted 8 hours\\nand was completed smoothly, but the patient\u2019s urine volume was only 100 mL during the\\noperation. The patient developed a fever of 39.1\u00b0C at 30 minutes after surgery, and in\\nrapid succession, his blood pressure decreased to 70/40 mmHg and he fell into a coma,\\nrequiring ventilator assistance for breathing. Re-examination showed a white blood cell\\ncount of 7.19 \u00d7 109/L (normal, 4.0\u201310 \u00d7 109/L),\\nneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of 83.6% (normal,: 50% to 70%), and serum creatinine of\\n240.3 \u00b5mol/L (normal, 54\u2013133 \u00b5mol/L). Blood culture indicated the presence of\\nAcinetobacter baumannii, and the antibiotic sensitivity pattern\\nindicated that it was pan resistant and only sensitive to tegacyclin. The patient\u2019s blood\\nlactate and procalcitonin levels were 3.26 mmol/L (normal, 0.5\u20131.7 mmol/L) and 61.02 ng/mL\\n(normal, 0\u20130.5 ng/mL). Based on the Sepsis-3 criteria, sepsis shock and grade 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) was diagnosed.\\nThe oXiris hemofilter (Gambro Industries, Meyzieu, France) was used for CRRT treatment\\nafter surgery. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and his wife, and\\nall procedures followed hospital CARE guidelines. A vascular access port was established\\nusing a dual-chamber 11.5 F hemodialysis catheter that was placed into the femoral vein.\\nCVVH treatment was performed using a PRISMAFLEX dialysis machine (Gambro-Hospal,\\nStockholm, Sweden) that was equipped with an oXiris hemofilter. The blood flow rate was\\nmaintained at 180 to 200 mL/minute. Predilution was used, and the amount of replacement\\nfluid was 4000 mL/hour; the ultrafiltration rate was 100 to 200 mL/hour, and it was\\nadjusted based on the infusion speed. Anticoagulants were not used, and the hemofiltration\\nprescription was adjusted based on the electrolyte and acid\u2013base results. The patient was\\nalso concurrently administered tigecycline combined with caspofungin and ganciclovir as\\nanti-infectives, and fluid replacement and norepinephrine were administered as\\nantihypotensives.\\nThe patient underwent CVVH for 48 hours (with two oXiris hemofilter replacements during\\nthis time), and his blood pressure gradually stabilized. The norepinephrine dose was\\ngradually reduced (), and\\nit was discontinued after 48 hours. The patient regained consciousness, and he was taken\\noff the ventilator after 3 days. The Chronic Liver Failure (CLIF) Consortium\\nAcute-on-Chronic Liver Failure score (commonly known as CLIF-C ACLFs) decreased from 63 to\\n43 (). After 48 hours of\\nCVVH using the oXiris hemofilters, the procalcitonin and endotoxin levels and the\\ninflammatory factor interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels also gradually decreased (). After hemodynamic\\nstabilization, the patient\u2019s treatment was changed, and traditional filters were used with\\nintermittent CVVH. The patient underwent 11 rounds of blood purification. Subsequently,\\nhis liver and kidney functions were completely restored. The patient was hospitalized for\\n51 days, and was discharged after recovery. He was doing well at 1 year after the\\ntransplantation.", "age": "[[35.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18799607': 1, '34549016': 1, '30982026': 1, '9917534': 1, '11445675': 1, '30626586': 1, '27834446': 1, '11543799': 1, '25268099': 1, '31369593': 1, '12490963': 1, '17448226': 1, '25123792': 1, '23650198': 1, '19846848': 1, '26903338': 1, '10203370': 1, '15639681': 1, '9500623': 1, '18434884': 1, '30974444': 1, '8240070': 1, '21183148': 1, '32686965': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
