There was history of about 10-kg weight loss amounting to 15% of his body weight over a period of the past one month. Ophthalmic examination revealed visual acuity of 20/30 in both eyes. His right eyeball was pushed inferiorly and laterally and left eye showed axial proptosis []. Hertel's exophthalmometry reading was 24 mm in the right eye (RE) and 21 mm in the left eye (LE) with intercanthal distance of 110 mm. RE was shifted inferiorly by 5 mm and laterally by 2 mm as measured with plastic scale. There was increased retrobulbar resistance. In the RE, maximal restriction of ocular movements was noted in levoelevation and adduction with mild restriction in other gazes. There was mild restriction of movements in all gazes in the LE. On deep palpation a smooth, round, firm, non-tender mass (approximately 2.5 cm \u00d7 2 cm) could be palpated in the superior orbit of the RE. The posterior extent of the mass could not be reached and it was free from the overlying skin. No mass lesion could be palpated in the LE. The proptosis was non-compressible and did not have any postural variation. Anterior segment biomicroscopy and pupillary reactions were normal in both eyes except for higher intraocular pressure in the RE of 24 mm of Hg on Goldman applanation tonometry. The intraocular pressure was 12 mm of Hg in the LE. Fundus examination revealed few scattered hemorrhages and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and orbit revealed bilateral multiple, well-defined, round, soft tissue masses, isointense with muscles in the intraconal and extraconal space []. Three days after his initial presentation to us, the patient noticed development of subcutaneous nodules on his left thigh and abdomen.\\nThe differential diagnosis of secondaries from an unknown primary, blood cell-related tumor including lymphoma or plasma cell dyscrasias was kept. Hemogram and coagulation profile showed hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dl (Normal: 14-16 g/dl) though his blood counts and coagulation profile was normal. To look for an unknown primary from the lung, prostate, gastrointestinal tract; endoscopy, colonoscopy, stool examination and prostate examination was done. Examination of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and prostate was unremarkable. CT abdomen revealed paravertebral soft tissue mass and contrast enhanced CT (CECT) chest revealed a soft tissue mass in the parahilar region.\\nFine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) followed by incision biopsy of the orbital mass and FNAC from the left thigh nodule showed cellular sheets of mature and immature plasma cells, many binucleate and multinucleate forms were seen, suggestive of plasmacytoma []. Keeping in the mind diagnosis of multiple myeloma Bence-Jones protein testing, bone marrow examination, skeletal survey and immunofixation was done. The urine was positive for Bence-Jones protein. Serum and urine electrophoresis showed a sharp M-band in the gamma region. Immunofixation confirmed the diagnosis of IgG multiple myeloma. Skeletal survey, however, did not reveal any lytic lesions. Bone marrow examination subsequently revealed >20% plasma cells and >36% lymphoplasmacytic cells []. Renal function tests (RFT) and serum electrolytes were done as their derangement is common in multiple myeloma. The RFT (Normal: blood urea- 15-45 mg/dl, serum creatinine-0.8-1.8 mg/dl) were deranged 10 days after admission with blood urea 64 mg/dl, serum creatinine 3.1 mg /dl.\\nPatient was started on chemotherapy in consultation with the oncologist (Pulse therapy of Melphalan and Prednisolone). Patient responded dramatically to treatment with remission of eye manifestations [] and skin nodules within three weeks of starting treatment.", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'3603371': 1, '3658377': 1, '589756': 1, '8325417': 1, '32637279': 1, '3587904': 1, '27800278': 2, '16901345': 2, '11966603': 1, '15745416': 1, '32884366': 2, '4550269': 1, '22814986': 1, '30306967': 1, '30117481': 2, '6253777': 1, '8472122': 1, '19700882': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'1564147-1': 1, '6198690-1': 1, '7434372-1': 1, '5076298-1': 1}"}
