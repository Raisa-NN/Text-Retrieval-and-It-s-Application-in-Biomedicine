Her mother had been diagnosed with carcinoma of the uterus in her 40s. The case had previously suffered from an episode of seizures years earlier, and valproic acid was initiated as an anticonvulsant medication. Two years later, she had another episode of symmetrical convulsions. An MRI of the CNS revealed a left-sided, frontal, cystic tumor, which was edemic and compressed the left lateral ventricle, but there were no signs of obstruction of the CNS fluid flow (D). Craniotomy with microneurosurgical radical resection was performed. Histopathological diagnosis was diffusively infiltrating astrocytoma Grade III (i.e., anaplastic astrocytoma). The tumor was weakly positive in IDH1 R132H-immunostaining (E) and the MIB-1 proliferation index was 5%. The mother received postoperative radiotherapy to tumor bed 59.4/1.8 Gy. Six control cranial MRIs during the 3-yr follow-up revealed no residuals or recidives. Six years after diagnosis, the patient was asymptomatic. As the child was diagnosed with AT/RT, genetic analyses were done because of family history. The results showed a germline TP53 mutation in both cases, which is known to cause Li\u2013Fraumeni syndrome.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28270529': 1, '26014290': 1, '10742099': 1, '1581912': 1, '19505943': 1, '27861763': 1, '21779515': 1, '1349175': 1, '7697714': 1, '32888145': 1, '26439168': 1, '17618441': 1, '15188009': 1, '24812344': 1, '18330515': 1, '21965822': 1, '24889532': 1, '24810474': 1, '24881141': 1, '22851694': 1, '22388286': 1, '27535533': 1, '21266059': 1, '27657132': 1, '19554337': 1, '11219776': 1, '9135006': 1, '20139980': 1, '22399191': 1, '25164322': 1, '27196377': 1, '20601685': 1, '20110278': 1, '23355100': 1, '1565143': 1, '26061751': 1, '12718885': 1, '14638962': 1, '22829774': 1, '11125122': 1, '20981092': 1, '9671307': 1, '24060862': 1, '1978757': 1, '26645051': 1, '19228619': 1, '17898525': 1, '32467344': 1, '26923874': 1, '29602769': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5880256-1': 2}"}
