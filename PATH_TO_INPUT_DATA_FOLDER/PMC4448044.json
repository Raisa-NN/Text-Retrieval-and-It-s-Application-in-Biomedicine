She had been treated for hypothyroidism for 22 years and for chronic RA for 11 years. There was no family history of lipodystrophy. On her initial visit, physical examination revealed multifocal loss of subcutaneous fat on her bilateral upper limbs, shoulders, back, abdomen and left lower limb (fig. ). A biopsy specimen from the right shoulder revealed a decrease in adipose tissue (fig. ), a prominent increase in collagen fibers (fig. ) and dense infiltration of lymphocytes around the vesicles (fig. ). A full blood count was within the normal range. The biochemical profile revealed increased levels of anti-CCP (31.6 U/ml), MMP-3 (148 ng/ml) and CH50 (72.4 U/ml) as well as prominently decreased levels of TSH (0.23 \u03bcU/ml). The serum levels of leptin and adiponectin were within the normal range. From the above findings, we diagnosed the patient as having adult-onset APL accompanied by RA without a family history.\\nTo investigate the immunological background of the local skin area, we employed immunohistochemical staining, which revealed that these infiltrating lymphocytes were mainly composed of CD205+ matured dendritic cells (fig. ), and these cells produced MMP-7 (fig. ), MMP-28 (fig. ) and IL-27 (fig. ). CD163+ macrophages (fig. ) and IL-17-producing cells (fig. ) were scattered in the same area.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'31924231': 1, '25873875': 2, '14764690': 1, '19924133': 1, '23071464': 1, '24152769': 1, '18803661': 1, '20705635': 1, '14614851': 1, '21707759': 1, '26034476': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4386117-1': 1}"}
