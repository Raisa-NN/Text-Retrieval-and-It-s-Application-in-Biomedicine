Review of outside medical records revealed that in August 2014, a biopsy of a left scalp lesion showed a non-ulcerated, 1.3 mm thick melanoma. He subsequently underwent wide local excision (WLE) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The SLNB was positive for a 4 mm focus of BRAF wild-type melanoma in the subcapsular region of a left cervical lymph node. A PET/CT scan did not show any metastatic lesions.\\nDuring his consultation at UCSF, the initial diagnosis of stage IIIA melanoma was confirmed. Unfortunately, in the interim he had developed new hyperpigmented papules on his left chest. One was biopsied on 5/19/15, and pathology demonstrated features of epidermotropic metastatic melanoma. He was upstaged to stage IV melanoma, and on 7/1/15 was started on a clinical trial of intralesional IL-12. He had progressive lesions after 12 weeks on therapy, and on 9/15/15 was transitioned to standard of care pembrolizumab. He received two doses (10/5/15, 10/26/15) which were well tolerated, but had rapidly increasing size and number of hyperpigmented papules and plaques across his chest, bilateral arms and back. On 11/16/15 he received his first dose of combination ipilimumab/nivolumab. A PET/CT scan on 11/20/15 did not show any lesions concerning for metastasis. He went on to receive four induction doses of ipilimumab/nivolumab; a PET/CT scan was repeated on 2/11/16 and he was transitioned to nivolumab monotherapy. At this time, the patient remains on nivolumab and is tolerating treatment well.", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24124141': 1, '10655437': 1, '30755811': 1, '19097774': 1, '18523064': 1, '30291373': 1, '33200246': 1, '28382381': 1, '26261262': 1, '8355058': 1, '34778067': 1, '33760957': 1, '22109345': 1, '10775847': 1, '33804417': 1, '19934295': 1, '34495433': 1, '31903160': 1, '9576286': 1, '32753543': 1, '26951310': 1, '33367885': 1, '26204273': 1, '30694399': 1, '30112704': 1, '17295038': 1, '12167578': 1, '27660712': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
