The patient was asymptomatic on presentation. His past ocular history was significant for bilateral congenital cataracts which required bilateral cataract extraction by phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) implantation at 2 months of age. There was no other relevant medical (topical or systemic medication) or surgical history. Despite this intervention, the patient developed bilateral amblyopia and had severe nystagmus when either eye was occluded. At the time of presentation, his visual acuity was hand motion in both eyes. Tonometry and specular microscopy were not possible given the degree of nystagmus. Slit lamp examination of the right eye revealed a clear cornea with a fine pigmented line involving 360 degrees of the peripheral endothelium and a clear PCIOL. The left eye revealed normal conjunctiva, a clear central cornea with 360 degrees of peripheral stromal corneal edema with microbullae without epithelial defect, or vascularization, and a clear PCIOL (fig. ). The rest of the ocular examination was normal. These findings were consistent with incipient BMS in the right eye and established BMS in the left eye. The patient remained asymptomatic, and no further treatment was started at the time.", "age": "[[12.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16440013': 1, '20457949': 1, '5450846': 1, '15210241': 1, '1468222': 1, '9220251': 1, '11524211': 1, '34527877': 2, '8506907': 1, '23449482': 1, '12663034': 1, '5791370': 1, '22414362': 1, '21704570': 1, '26034485': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8409359-1': 1}"}
