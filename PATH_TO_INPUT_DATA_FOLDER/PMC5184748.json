Examination revealed pedal edema, ascites, and hepatosplenomegaly. The patient had a normal body mass index (20.16) for her age and was not malnourished at presentation (Subjective Global Assessment of Nutritional Status class A). Investigations revealed a borderline low platelet count (110 \u00d7 109/L), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] (36mm/h), and prolonged international normalized ratio [INR] (1.8). Mild elevation of the transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]:68 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase [ALT]:38 IU/L), hypoproteinemia (5.6 g/dl), and hypoalbuminemia (2.9g/dl) were noted. Ascitic fluid revealed a high serum ascites albumin gradient [SAAG] (1.8g/dl). Ultrasonography (USG) confirmed hepatosplenomegaly with coarse liver echotexture and presence of collaterals suggesting portal hypertension. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed grade 2 esophageal varices. Serological tests for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, hepatitis viruses, and cytomegalovirus were negative. Iron profile, autoimmune, and metabolic workup (including Wilson's) was non-contributory.\\nIgA tissue transglutaminase (TTG) done as a part of the diarrhea workup was strongly positive (542 IU/L). Duodenal biopsy showed moderate villous blunting, increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), and crypt hyperplasia []. In view of the radiological and biochemical derangements, a percutaneous liver biopsy was also performed which showed parenchymal nodules separated by fibrous septae. Diffuse moderate-to-severe macrovesicular steatosis (65\u201370% of the hepatic parenchyma), hepatocyte ballooning, mild portal inflammation, and 2\u20134 foci of lobular inflammation/10 \u00d7 were also noted [Figures - and -]. Piecemeal necrosis was not seen. A histopathological impression of cirrhosis with moderate activity and steatosis was suggested. The patient was put on a gluten free regimen, diuretics, and vitamin supplements. Complete resolution of ascites and near-normal transaminase levels was noted 6 months later when the patient presented again with the complaint of abdominal pain. Examination was unremarkable and investigations revealed a minimal elevation of AST (43 IU/L), other biochemical parameters being normal. Hematological parameters including platelet count (170 \u00d7 109/L) were within normal limits. ESR, however, was elevated at 50 mm/h. USG displayed normal liver echotexture, minimal free fluid, but without any evidence of portal hypertension. An occasional subcentimetric mesenteric lymph node was noted. Ascitic fluid (AF) showed lymphocyte predominance and a low SAAG (0.8 g/dl). AF adenosine deaminase level was 57 U/L suggesting peritoneal tuberculosis. Peritoneal biopsy done for confirming tubercular pathology revealed epithelioid cell granulomas; however, acid fast bacilli (AFB) were not detected. The patient was put on antitubercular therapy in view of the above findings. She was religiously following the gluten free dietary regimen and was asked to continue the same.\\nThree months subsequently (i.e., 9 months after initial presentation), follow-up liver biopsy revealed complete disappearance of the steatosis and reversal of the fibrosis with minimal expansion of the portal tracts [Figure and ]. Only an occasional focus of lobular inflammation was noted. Biochemical, clinical, and hematological parameters including platelet count (180 \u00d7 109/L) were normal. USG at this juncture displayed normal liver echotexture, no organomegaly, free fluid, or evidence of portal hypertension. A fibroscan unfortunately could not be performed in this case. Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and is doing well 3 years after her initial presentation and is completely adherent to the GFD.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12524403': 1, '17567829': 1, '30002342': 1, '12883497': 1, '17414134': 1, '17969053': 1, '16447275': 1, '22087157': 1, '11910339': 1, '12297848': 1, '27976643': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
