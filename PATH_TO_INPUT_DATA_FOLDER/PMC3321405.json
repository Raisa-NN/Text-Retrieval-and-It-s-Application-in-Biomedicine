Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis had been performed for the preceding 8 months. The patient had no trauma, hematuria, or pain and no signs of overhydration. Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels were 71.1 and 13.3, respectively. Potassium was slightly elevated. On physical examination, the abdomen was soft and nontender. The peritoneal catheter was functioning normally. Both the scrotum and the penis were swollen and nontender (). The scrotum transmitted light. Ultrasonography was performed to exclude an inguinal hernia. On ultrasonography, patency between the peritoneal cavity and the right inguinal canal was revealed and there was a large hydrocele (). However, there was no sign of bowel hernia. Peritoneal dialysis was temporarily replaced by hemodialysis to allow the edema to subside. Surgical repair was done. During the operation, the inguinal sac was found and high ligation was performed. The patient had complete resolution and returned to ambulatory treatment uneventfully at 1 month after the operation. However, the patient revisited the clinic for recurrent scrotal and penile swelling at 2 months after the operation. Although we tried intermittent peritoneal dialysis with a low dialysate volume, the genital edema was resolved only after hemodialysis was performed about 3 months later.", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'2321120': 1, '4057370': 1, '8510253': 1, '3343751': 1, '22500255': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
