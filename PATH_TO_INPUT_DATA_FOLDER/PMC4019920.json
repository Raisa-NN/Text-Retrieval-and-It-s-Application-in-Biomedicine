One month after radiation and chemotherapy she received a control magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this MRI a new glioblastoma, which was not in approximation with the first tumor could be seen. The new tumor was localized in the right medial frontal gyrus, with edema extending into the inferior frontal gyrus ().\\nIt was interesting that the patient complained about a disturbing persisting dry cough, which started a month before the MRI. The cough appeared all over the day without any provocation (no stimuli). The cough appeared in bouts. No other changes in the breathing of the patient could be observed. Internal medicine evaluation did not identify any pathology explaining the cough. Immediately after surgical removal of the tumor the cough disappeared.", "age": "[[59.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22306285': 1, '21414916': 1, '15004208': 1, '23497672': 1, '24847431': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
