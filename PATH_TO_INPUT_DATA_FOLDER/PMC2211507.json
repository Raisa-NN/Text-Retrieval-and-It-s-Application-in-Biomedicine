Histopathologic examination of a submaxillary lymph node demonstrated follicular hyperplasia. DN T cells were 3.6% and Fas-induced lymphocyte apoptosis was borderline. Blood analyses also showed increased IgM and IgA levels and lupus anticoagulant. At the age of 4, he developed transient mild hemolytic anemia; hematological alterations spontaneously remitted at the age of 5, but laterocervical adenopathy increased to bulky masses. The left submaxillary and cervical lymph nodes began to compress the upper airways and were excised when he was ten years old; he is now in hematological remission, with persisting bulky laterocervical lymphadenopathies. The patient's father died of peritoneal carcinosis at 33. The paternal grandfather had died of gastric cancer.", "age": "[[12.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15728124': 1, '17605793': 1, '11418480': 1, '9039262': 1, '10515860': 1, '12697265': 1, '23820649': 1, '12352631': 1, '7539157': 1, '10412980': 1, '32067110': 1, '33995372': 1, '10755819': 1, '16720836': 1, '11717445': 1, '8787672': 1, '12819469': 1, '11048730': 1, '10189330': 1, '16537120': 1, '34171534': 1, '7540117': 1, '16627752': 1, '29123652': 1, '22983577': 1, '12655301': 1, '17517660': 1, '12620239': 1, '24623740': 1, '12198154': 1, '7575433': 1, '29911256': 1, '10807785': 1, '11583996': 1, '14592838': 1, '10090885': 1, '18424336': 1, '22180424': 1, '16446975': 1, '9533447': 1, '9108407': 1, '17999750': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2211507-1': 2}"}
