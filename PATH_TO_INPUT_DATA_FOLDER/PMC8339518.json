She had lost the nail as a child, due to trauma, but could not recall any recent trauma, pain, or bleeding. She had no previous history or family risk of melanoma.\\nPhysical examination showed a longitudinal dark streak of 15 \u00d7 6 mm on the right great toenail (shown in Fig. ). On removing the nail plate, a cystic lesion amounting 10 \u00d7 10 mm appeared within the nail bed. However, pigmentation of the nail or nail bed was lacking. The remaining toenails and fingernails were unaffected. A biopsy of the nail bed was performed. Histopathological examination of the totally embedded biopsy revealed multiple cysts within the dermis of the nail bed, appearing to be free-lying cysts, but in close proximity to the epithelium of the nail bed (shown in Fig. , ). The cysts were lined by the stratified squamous epithelium without the granular layer or any cellular atypia. The cysts contained luminal onycholemmal keratin (Fig. ), whereas melanocytic lesion was not present, confirmed by negative immunohistochemical melanocytic antigens. Postoperatively, the defect healed by secondary intention (moist wound treatment) without nail deformity.", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'2767289': 1, '28378483': 1, '15083230': 1, '17097384': 1, '27622253': 1, '14441224': 1, '23210750': 1, '5825765': 1, '5361425': 1, '34413739': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
