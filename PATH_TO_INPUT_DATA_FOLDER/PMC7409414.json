She was on thyroxin, but not on potassium tablets. There was no significant family history. She had generalized muscle weakness but her tendon reflexes, plantar responses and sensory examination were normal. Except for grade two multi nodular goiter remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed hypokalemia (serum potassium 2.4 mmol/L), compensated metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap and alkaline urine indicating RTA (Table ). She had marginally low serum calcium, normal phosphate and high alkaline phosphatase suggestive of osteomalacia, but her x-rays were normal. Her haemoglobin was normal and blood picture was compatible with SAO.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19391452': 1, '17656477': 1, '32154456': 1, '12081559': 1, '15255328': 1, '28186530': 1, '22973182': 1, '5030176': 1, '10926824': 1, '12138150': 1, '10403343': 1, '30773598': 1, '34986796': 1, '28994037': 1, '617605': 1, '32758154': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7409414-1': 2, '7409414-2': 2, '7409414-3': 2, '7409414-4': 2, '7409414-5': 2}"}
