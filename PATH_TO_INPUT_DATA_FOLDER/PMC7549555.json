She had typical craniofacial abnormalities, including fine and sparse depigmented hair, broad and sparse eyebrows, a pear-shaped nose, long and smooth philtrum, a thin upper lip, prominent ears with an abnormal fold, and some jaundice (Figure ). She had a short stature with a short neck, brachydactyly, and scoliosis (Figure ). She also had slight mental retardation. X-ray of the right knee revealed a cartilage tumor on the right femur. Clinical experiments showed that there was no obvious abnormality in the content of amino acids and acylcarnitine spectrum (C0\u2013C18). Serum biochemical examination showed abnormal liver function. Indexes of liver function including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic acid (L-CAC), total bile acid (TBA), urea, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and copper blue protein (CBP) were upregulated; however, prealbumin (PAB) was downregulated.", "age": "[[4.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21681106': 1, '25792522': 1, '25177352': 1, '18424451': 1, '14560312': 1, '11112658': 1, '16243138': 1, '10647898': 1, '10615131': 1, '29853764': 1, '18478599': 1, '11807863': 1, '25741868': 1, '26269715': 1, '19389374': 1, '11841536': 1, '18456591': 1, '20569260': 1, '22964620': 1, '12761050': 1, '33073934': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7549555-1': 2, '7549555-2': 2, '7549555-3': 2, '7549555-4': 2}"}
