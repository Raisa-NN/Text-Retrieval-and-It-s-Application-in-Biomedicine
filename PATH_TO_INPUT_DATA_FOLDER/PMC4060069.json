He had history of dual-chamber pacemaker implantation due to sick sinus syndrome. On admission, computed tomography of the chest demonstrated bilateral pulmonary infiltrate. Multiple blood cultures confirmed positive for staphylococcus aureus. Trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed the pacemaker in the right ventricular and a giant vegetation sized 16*10 mm in the tricuspid valve causing moderate insufficiency, however, due to poor image quality, relationship between pacemaker lead and the vegetation could not be identified. Trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was then utilized for further evaluation which confirmed not only a large vegetation attaching to the tricuspid valve causing tricuspid valve insufficiency but also no thickening, adhesion or limited opening of the tricuspid valve (Figure - upper panel). Further RT3D TEE confirmed a highly mobile vegetation sized 17*11*8 mm attach to posterior as well as septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve which was originated from pacemaker lead. (Figure - lower panel). This patient was then underwent open heart surgical procedure done through the right atrium with cardio-pulmonary bypass and cardiac arrest. A giant vegetation originated from pace-marker lead while attaching to posterior as well as septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve was noted during intraoperative exploration which was identical to preoperative 3D TEE (Figure ). As for this patient, extraction of the pace-marker lead, tricuspid valve replacement with bio-prosthetic valve, as well as epicardial temporary pacemaker implantation was done due to massive damage of the valve leaflet. The patient recovered fully on antibiotic administration and was discharged afebrile 4 weeks after surgery and remained stable without any sign of recurrence 3 months after discharge.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12891205': 1, '9723637': 1, '20223431': 1, '17481444': 1, '20048212': 1, '9133520': 1, '24885219': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
