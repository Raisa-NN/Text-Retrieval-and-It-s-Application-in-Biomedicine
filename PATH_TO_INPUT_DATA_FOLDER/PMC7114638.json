The mother had accidentally noticed the spot when the child was around five months of age and she was referred to us by her local ophthalmologist with the query to rule out retinoblastoma. The child had central, steady, and maintained fixation in both eyes. Retinoscopy revealed a dull glow in the right eye with a cycloplegic refraction of \u201318.00 D and a clear red glow in the left eye with cycloplegic refraction of +1.00 D in undilated state. On torch light, leukocoria with normal anterior segment and clear lens was noted. The white reflex was more prominent from the superior one third of the pupil, more evident in the dilated state. Keeping in mind the differential diagnosis of retinoblastoma, retinopathy of prematurity and exudative retinopathy, an examination under anesthesia was advised.\\nOn examination under anesthesia, the fundus showed a yellowish white shiny area (Figure 1A ) superior to the disc extending till the superior ora and forming a membranous fold behind the lens in this area, giving an appearance of retrolental fibroplasia (Figure 1B ). Intraoperative OCT (Figure 1C ) confirmed a thickened retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) with compact retina, which confirmed our diagnosis of myelinated nerve fibers (MNF).", "age": "[[9.0, 'month']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9397022': 1, '23307221': 1, '21035071': 1, '9441705': 1, '32269912': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
