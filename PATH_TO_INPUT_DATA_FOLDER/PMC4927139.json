She was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 128/83 mm Hg, heart rate of 57 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. On exam sclerae were slightly icteric, and she had mild epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory evaluation revealed AST of 634 units/L, ALT of 1036 units/L, ALP of 94 units/L, and total bilirubin of 6.9 units/L. Serologic testing for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Abdominal imaging was consistent with cholelithiasis. ERCP revealed 3 stones in the CBD that were each 12 mm in size. Sphincterotomy resulted in extraction of stones with excellent drainage. Symptoms resolved and hepatic chemistries normalized.", "age": "[[28.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'4086745': 1, '19673021': 1, '33654367': 1, '33981765': 1, '32280751': 1, '14064022': 1, '30911921': 1, '15667485': 1, '2870885': 1, '33104848': 1, '23536736': 1, '31473761': 1, '27408902': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4927139-1': 2, '4927139-2': 2, '4927139-3': 2}"}
