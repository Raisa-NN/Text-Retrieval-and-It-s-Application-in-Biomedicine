MRI revealed an irregular 63\u00d747\u00d780 mm mass located posterior to sternocleidomastoid muscle after which PET scan demonstrated hypermetabolic profile of the cervical mass in addition to suspicious hypermetabolic lesions at spleen and adrenal gland. Patient described the absence of B-symptoms. Past medical history was significant for tonsillectomy and surgically-resected anal condyloma while family history was significant for hepatocellular carcinoma in father. Biopsy revealed germinal center DLBCL with positivity for Bcl-6 and c-myc, however, FISH analysis ruled out c-myc and Bcl-6 positivity. Patient received 2 cycles of R-CHOP regimen which was followed by 2 cycles of dose-adjusted R-EPOCH due to lack of metabolic response.
