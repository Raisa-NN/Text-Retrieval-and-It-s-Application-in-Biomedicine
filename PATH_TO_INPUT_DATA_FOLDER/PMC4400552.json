Her pregnancy was uneventful and she remained asymptomatic despite persistent hypokalemia. Potassium levels were followed at a regular basis and ranged between 2.3 and 3.1 mmol/L (2.3 and 3.1 mEq/L). She was electively admitted to hospital at 39 weeks of gestational age for full-term induction of labor. A PICC line was placed to allow replacement of electrolytes. The patient received 240 mEq of intravenous potassium chloride and 180 mEq per oral, as well as 4 g of intravenous magnesium sulfate and 1200 mEq of oral magnesium oxide. She was continued on 150 mg daily of eplerenone. Despite aggressive electrolyte replacement, her potassium and magnesium levels ranged between 2.0 and 3.0 mmol/L (2.0 and 3.0 mEq/L) and 1.1 and 2.6 mmol/L (1.1 and 2.6 mEq/L), respectively. The baby was born healthy with 2863 g, and Apgar measurements were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. She was discharged two days after giving birth and has remained symptom free.", "age": "[[27.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9745103': 1, '26887881': 1, '20350237': 1, '7771477': 1, '15198796': 1, '9988141': 1, '29026553': 2, '21299518': 1, '15056980': 1, '29997688': 1, '28393002': 2, '20705448': 1, '15976513': 1, '20349406': 1, '8651241': 1, '16449157': 1, '21999963': 1, '19241082': 1, '6134137': 1, '29051782': 1, '21252808': 1, '4336938': 1, '5929460': 1, '20100726': 1, '34941636': 2, '27579097': 1, '21342329': 1, '22284312': 1, '18639243': 1, '26064481': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5628240-1': 1, '8705311-1': 1, '5331980-1': 1}"}
