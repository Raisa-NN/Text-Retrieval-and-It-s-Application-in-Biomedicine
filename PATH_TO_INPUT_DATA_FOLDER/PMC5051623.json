The abdominal pain was initially mild and tolerable, but progressively worsened. She complained of right upper abdominal pain but had no vomiting or diarrhea. On initial examination, there was mild abdominal distension and right upper quadrant tenderness with a scratch wound. Except for these findings, the physical examination was normal without fluid collection on focused assessment with ultrasonography for trauma (FAST). The patient\u2019s white blood cell count was mildly elevated at 8,900/\u00b5L, hemoglobin level was 12.9 g/dL, platelet count was 211,000/\u00b5L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein level was 3.44 mg/dL. On abdominal radiography, a mass-like lesion was observed in the right upper quadrant (). We could not suspect that the abnormal finding was associated with trauma. For this reason, we consulted the general surgeons and pediatricians and requested radiology for abdominal ultrasonography. The radiologist confirmed ileocolic intussusception; fortunately, enteric perfusion was preserved, and other complications were not noted (). We decided to perform air reduction, after which the intussusception was successfully reduced. The patient was hospitalized in the pediatric ward for observation. Two days later, she was discharged to home without relapse or complication.", "age": "[[4.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17011313': 1, '9751561': 1, '14872293': 1, '5426849': 1, '14129801': 1, '6802041': 1, '17101374': 1, '19214494': 1, '27752618': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
