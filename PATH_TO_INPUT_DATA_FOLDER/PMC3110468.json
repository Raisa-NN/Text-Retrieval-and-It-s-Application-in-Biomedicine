Fluid-filled blisters, bullae and vesicles were present on soft palate, buccal mucosa, gingiva and muco-buccal fold areas [Figure \u2013]. The patient suffered from pain in mouth, difficulty in speaking and eating. She had visited a dentist for the same problem 3 to 4 months back and was prescribed topical steroids but there was no improvement. Medical history revealed that she had been treated for skin lesions with methyl prednisolone and cyclophosphamide for at least 7 to 8 months, but the oral lesions were not responding to the treatment and were recurrent. A biopsy was obtained. Histopathological examinations revealed suprabasal shedding of surface layers with acantholytic cells []. DIF studies showed granular deposits of lgG and C3 in intercellular spaces between keratinocytes. A final diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris was confirmed. It was decided to treat these lesions with CO2 laser, as for the previous patient. CO2 laser was used (10.6 nm wavelength continuous wave at 1.0-1.5 W) to irradiate the lesions on one side of the mouth for 5-10s [Figures \u2013]. The patient reported no pain after treatment. The healing process was checked at 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits [Figure \u2013]. No recurrence was seen. Subsequently other lesions were treated. The patient was symptom free.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28912937': 1, '29071023': 1, '3123826': 1, '12393759': 1, '12036164': 1, '15024356': 1, '10148213': 1, '15464552': 1, '17642810': 1, '21691552': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3110468-1': 2}"}
