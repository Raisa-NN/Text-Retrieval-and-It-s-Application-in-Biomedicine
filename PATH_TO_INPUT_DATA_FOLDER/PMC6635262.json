The pulmonary function test showed severe obstructive lung defect (FVC 73, FEV1 38, FEV1/FVC ratio 34). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report and accompanying images.\\nHe arrived at the operation room wearing a nasal prong with the oxygen flow at 5 L/min. The vital signs were monitored: blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg, heart rate of 90 and SpO2 of 92%. The initial ABGA showed pH 7.49, PCO2 38 mm Hg, PaO2 68 mm Hg, HCO3 29 mmol/L, BE 5.4 mmol/L, and SaO2 95%. Preoxygenation was performed with HFNC (Fisher&Paykel Optiflow ThriveTM) for 3 minutes before anesthetic medications; the oxygen flow was set at 50 L/min and the FiO2 at 1.0. After preoxygenation, SpO2 reached 100%, and the ABGA after HFNC showed pH 7.49, PCO2 39 mm Hg, PaO2 343 mm Hg, HCO3 29.7 mmol/L, BE 5.9 mmol/L, and SaO2 100%. While maintaining the HFNC, the rigid bronchoscope was then inserted after the administration of propofol 2 to 5 \u03bcg/mL, remifentanil 1 to 5 ng/mL and rocuronium 50 mg.\\nSpO2 remained at 100% until the rigid bronchoscope was completely inserted and the ABGA performed at the point showed pH 7.36, PCO2 59 mm Hg, PaO2 209 mm Hg, HCO3 33.3 mmol/L, BE 6.2 mmol/L, and SaO2 100%. The total apneic time measured was 3 minutes 10 seconds. Mechanical ventilation combined with assisted ventilation was maintained during the surgery. The rigid bronchoscope was removed after the volume reduction surgery (Fig. ). The procedural time was 1 hour 20 minutes and the anesthetic time was 1 hour 35 minutes. HFNC was applied in the recovery room with the oxygen flow of 20 L/min. However, the patient complained of dyspnea in the recovery room, with decrease of SpO2 from 90% to 85%. Endotracheal intubation was performed with 8.0 ID and the patient was sent to the intensive care unit with an Ambu- bag streamed with the oxygen flow of 5 L/min.", "age": "[[77.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'33134145': 1, '25470890': 1, '25479117': 1, '27339225': 1, '26164643': 1, '17931878': 1, '25869405': 1, '25388828': 1, '32629688': 2, '25529351': 1, '31277092': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6635262-1': 2, '7337557-1': 1}"}
