Dermoscopy showed a yellowish erythematous area, yellow globules, hematic crust, a red-milky area, and polymorphic vessels, suggesting seborrheic keratosis, an adnexal tumor, or a traumatized melanocytic nevus (). The presence of a whitish veil, a bright white area, asymmetric follicular openings, and rhomboidal structures did not allow exclusion of cutaneous melanoma (). An excisional biopsy was performed and histopathological examination evidenced a circumscribed proliferation of large basaloid cell masses and sebaceous cells, with the diagnostic conclusion of sebaceoma.", "age": "[[80.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'33969662': 1, '25981016': 1, '7601953': 1, '28477886': 1, '12142607': 1, '31777362': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
