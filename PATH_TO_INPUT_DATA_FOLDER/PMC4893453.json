The swelling had increased in size over time causing difficulty in feeding. She had no associated pain. Clinical examination revealed a healthy-looking girl infant. She had a large protruded tongue, with a cystic swelling in the floor of the mouth measuring around 4 \u00d7 3 cm, with elevation of the tongue (); she had no palpable neck masses and the tongue mobility was normal. At the age of 3 months, marsupialization was done, but one week later the swelling recurred with the same size ().\\nCT scan of the neck revealed a 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 cm cyst in the floor of the mouth, most consistent with ranula. Epidermoid and dermoid cysts were rare possibilities. There were no other masses, collection, or abnormal calcification (). Decision was made to proceed with intraoral excision of the cyst. At 4 months of age surgical excision of the cyst was done with preservation of Wharton's ducts and the lingual nerves bilaterally that revealed a cyst of 4 \u00d7 2 cm (), with marked reduction in the size of the tongue ().\\nThe histopathology showed a cyst lined by focally eroded columnar epithelium partly replaced by granulation tissue; it is composed of smooth muscle and surrounded by skeletal muscle, a pattern consistent with ranula ().", "age": "[[4.0, 'month']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'31023732': 1, '9545611': 1, '20054853': 1, '3343879': 1, '17174774': 1, '23021915': 1, '14725982': 1, '22901652': 1, '15673973': 1, '23729331': 1, '20005579': 1, '12161740': 1, '31925320': 1, '15356464': 1, '18387677': 1, '29207849': 1, '27313929': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
