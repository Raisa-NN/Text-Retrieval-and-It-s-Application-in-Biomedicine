He mentioned that he first noticed the swelling two years ago. There were no symptoms associated with it. In physical examination, a solitary, painless, mobile, firm mass was determined in the right inguinal region of the patient. He had no other significant findings in physical examination or clinical work-up. The lesion was excised for diagnostic purposes. The specimen consisted of a well circumscribed mass measuring 2.5 cm in diameter. Its cut surface was whitish, nodular and firm. Representative sections of the specimen revealed a lymph node almost replaced by a spindle cell tumor (Figure ) consisting of cells with bland nuclear features and no significant mitotic activity. In several areas, nuclear palisading was noted and in these areas the tumor was reminiscent of a schwannoma. Focal stellate-shaped acellular eosinophilic structures were identified in the stroma (Figure ). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for cyclin D1 (Figure ) and smooth muscle actin, whereas they were negative for S-100 protein, cytokeratin, melan A, CD34, desmin and EMA. In this clinical setting, the morphology of the tumor along with its immunohistochemical findings were characteristic for an intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18684019': 1, '17284119': 1, '25025452': 1, '12873184': 1, '21718465': 2, '18991023': 1, '2712187': 1, '2712186': 1, '20205819': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3146916-1': 1}"}
