A patient was evaluated as a case of dementia and had frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital deficit signs on neuro-psychiatry evaluation. MRI was done as a part of her investigation on a 1.5T GE (Signa, USA) scanner, which showed diffuse cortical T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in bilateral frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital locations [Figures and ]. The cortical hyperintensities showed significant restriction on DWI [], giving rise to the strikingly conspicuous lesions compared to the normal cortex signal in the above locations.\\nThe radiologist first suspected the diagnosis and alerted the clinician. Later in the course of the disease, she developed myoclonic jerks, EEG changes which were consistent with the WHO criteria of probable CJD. The patient died in 6 months from the onset of symptoms.", "age": "[[75.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11115241': 1, '15956529': 1, '11242228': 1, '17114856': 1, '12722497': 1, '16139641': 1, '9869672': 1, '18575917': 1, '11965647': 1, '10791525': 1, '23189017': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
