Intraoral examination revealed healthy mucosa and there was not any sign of infection. Her past medical history was unremarkable. Panoramic radiography of the jaws showed 4 cm x 3 cm radiolucencies with quite ill-defined and irregular borders located bilaterally in molar edentulous regions (Figure ). Two small sclerotic flecks were associated with left radiolucent area. The lesions were asymptomatic and no expansion of the cortical jawbone was detected. A provisional diagnosis of odontogenic cyst or tumor was made and focal osteoporotic bone marrow defect was considered as a differential diagnosis based on age, site, clinical and radiographic findings. Under local anesthesia, a biopsy specimen was performed from the both edentulous molar regions and the tissues submitted to the Bauru School of Dentistry Oral Pathology Biopsy Service of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. The histopathological examination revealed normal hematopoietic bone marrow characterized by erythroid, granulocytic, monocytic and lymphocytic series (Figure ). In addition, megakaryocytes, fat cells and bone trabeculae were also observed (Figure ). Abnormal morphology of the hematopoietic cells or malignant cells was not seen. The histopathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of osteoporotic bone marrow defects of the mandible.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'6819349': 1, '270567': 1, '19445844': 1, '21872505': 1, '27747641': 2, '17214416': 1, '15532316': 1, '24471025': 2, '3277106': 1, '3457122': 1, '22873712': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5005556-1': 1, '3858146-1': 1, '3858146-2': 1, '3858146-3': 1}"}
