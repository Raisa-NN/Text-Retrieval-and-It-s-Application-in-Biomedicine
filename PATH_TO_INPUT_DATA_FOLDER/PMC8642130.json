Her advanced state of dementia made it difficult to obtain a sufficient history taking and physical examination; however, care provider had confirmed that her right arm had been in a normal state last night and witnessed that she slept using her right arm as a pillow. Her right arm showed severe purpura and skin tension; however, her radial artery was palpable (Figure ).\\nAn orthopedist referred her to our cardiovascular department. Computed tomography showed no significant stenosis of the right subclavian vein (Figure ).\\nUltrasonography in both normal and abduction positions also could not detect any significant findings. In addition, computed tomography and ultrasonography did not reveal any thrombus in the proximal and distal right subclavian vein. Nevertheless, her unilateral edema was similar to that of a venous disorder; therefore, we performed angiography of the right brachial vein in a normal position (Figure , left panel) and in an abduction position (Figure , right panel).\\nSignificant stenosis was seen in the latter position. In the absence of nervous and arterial symptoms, we diagnosed her with venous thoracic outlet syndrome. We were hesitant to pursue an invasive surgical strategy and anticoagulation due to the severity of her dementia; therefore, we used a bust-band to fix her right arm in the adduction position and guide her care provider not to use her arm as a pillow, which resolved her symptoms.", "age": "[[96.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28006856': 1, '1739007': 1, '29558408': 1, '31037504': 1, '34877192': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
