The computerised tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed a complex cystic lesion of 7\u20138 cm in the right adnexum and bilateral ureteric obstruction. All baseline blood tests including haematology and tumour markers (CA 125 -26 IU/ml) were normal. The serum tests showed normal liver function and moderately impaired renal function (creatinine 10\u201315, urea > 200).\\nShe had a complex medical history including obstructive sleep apnoea, asthma, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, hypertensive cardiomyopathy and bipolar disorder; registered disabled. She also had a copper intra uterine contraceptive device in situ for the past three years. Given her body habitus (BMI 42), abdominal and pelvic examination was difficult and non-specific. The only finding of relevance was bilateral adnexal fullness.\\nShe was managed within the gynaecological oncology multi disciplinary framework (MDT). On reviewing the CT films the features noted include bilateral basal pleural thickening, bilateral hydronephrosis, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis and bilateral adnexal cystic masses. There was a small volume of ascites.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for further characterisation of the adnexal masses. The right adnexal complex cystic lesion measured 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 cm in diameter and had a thick wall (up to 2 cm), which was irregular. There were several septations, some of which measured 3 \u2013 4 mm. There were no enhancing papillary formations, although the wall and septa enhanced. The appearance suggested an ovarian lesion with possible involvement of the Fallopian tube. The left adnexal cyst measured 5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 4 cm, had a smooth wall and contained a single thin septation, consistent with a benign ovarian cyst. Both cysts contained fluid, which was low on T1 and high on T2, with no evidence of fat or blood. Surrounding the cysts posteriorly, the fat was streaky in appearance and there was marked thickening of the adjacent fascial planes, with thickening of the mesorectal fascia up to 1 cm. The fascial thickening extended up the pre-sacral space and along the posterior aspect of the pelvic sidewalls, resulting in the obstruction of the ureters. Enlarged lymph nodes (up to 1.8 cm in short axis) were present along both pelvic sidewalls, which were striking due to the very high T2 signal intensity (Figure ). Nodes were also seen in the inguinal and para-aortic regions. Although the imaging appearances could not rule out an ovarian neoplasm, the features noted above were suggestive of an inflammatory process. In view of the woman's medical history and clinical status the MDT recommendation was clinical review and imaging guided biopsy of lymph nodes.\\nThe woman underwent CT guided right inter iliac node biopsy, following an unyielding biopsy of inguinal nodes. Histology revealed non-caseating granulomatous lymphadenitis with negative stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi. There was no foreign body seen. Given the histological findings our attention was directed towards an inflammatory process. She was subsequently referred to respiratory physicians, with a working diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She was also referred to urologists for the management of retroperitoneal fibrosis and bilateral hydronephrosis. Abdominal pain prompted insertion of bilateral JJ ureteric stents. The physicians initiated a (step-down) course of prednisolone. Symptomatic improvement was observed but the renal function did not change. Repeat imaging demonstrated resolution of hydronephrosis.\\nThe woman was reviewed again clinically after the course of steroids. During this interval the physicians ordered an autoantibody screen as autoimmune disease can co-exist with sarcoidosis; the screen was negative (Rheumatoid factor, anti-DNA antibody and antinuclear antibody). On examination there was no evidence of any palpable lymphadenopathy. An ultra sonographic examination six months later demonstrated a bulky uterus and reduction in the size of the right adnexal cyst. Repeat imaging (MRI axial T2W image) a further two months later demonstrated resolution of the left adnexal cyst. There was a small residual cyst on the right and marked decrease in the thickening of the mesorectal fascia. The lymph nodes appeared normal (Fig ). The retroperitoneal fibrosis on imaging had resolved. Her CA125 remained normal. Currently the patient is under joint care between the respiratory and renal physicians with symptomatic improvement.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'14211043': 1, '696789': 1, '2339730': 1, '32695535': 2, '15203600': 1, '2565262': 1, '23762732': 2, '12897340': 1, '6949574': 1, '15857040': 1, '25512071': 1, '29607232': 2, '27326296': 1, '5742108': 1, '17391534': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5828552-1': 1, '7361883-1': 1, '3671678-1': 1}"}
