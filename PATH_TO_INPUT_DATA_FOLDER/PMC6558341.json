She developed persistent hyponatremia, seizures, and behavioral symptoms and then, after a few weeks, progressive weakness and autonomic instability. She also had significant neuralgia. CSF studies were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed changes in keeping with reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy. Consecutive nerve conduction studies were normal, but needle assessment showed marked increased insertional activity and fibrillation potentials in the paraspinal, proximal, and distal muscles. Electrodiagnostic findings were in keeping with multilevel axonal polyradiculopathy. Expedited urine quantitative testing confirmed the diagnosis of AIP. She received heme and supportive therapy with resolution of weakness and seizures but had a spontaneous abortion.", "age": "[[27.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11940707': 1, '21855406': 1, '15652607': 1, '34201281': 1, '5343605': 1, '15372536': 1, '18669508': 1, '6941785': 1, '26792303': 1, '6769048': 1, '750931': 1, '23931806': 1, '15643299': 1, '24985076': 1, '17459418': 1, '2338564': 1, '34437931': 1, '31205461': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6558341-1': 2, '6558341-2': 2}"}
