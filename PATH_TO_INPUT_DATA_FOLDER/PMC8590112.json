The decrease of vision in the right eye was gradual, with no pain nor history of ocular trauma or surgeries. His left eye was amblyopic. The patient had no medical history or any significant family history. On ocular examination, his unassisted visual acuity was 20/200 in his right eye and hand motion in his left eye. The intraocular pressure was 18 mmHg bilaterally. On inspection, there was exotropia of the left eye. Next, the slit lamp evaluation of the anterior segment was within normal limits except for iris coloboma in the inferior nasal quadrant of each eye (Figure ).\\nDilated fundus examination showed optic disc and retinochoroidal coloboma in both eyes (Figure ) with juxtapapillary choroidal neovascularization in the right eye. Furthermore, we performed optical coherence tomography (OCT), which confirmed the presence of choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) (Figure ).", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25859137': 1, '11094243': 1, '945057': 1, '12713104': 1, '2378857': 1, '8297073': 1, '28299000': 1, '16932062': 1, '11825849': 1, '10525208': 1, '34796081': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
