She was the younger sister of Case-1. Slit lamp examination was performed. Schirmer test showed zero wetting of filter paper indicating absolute alacrimia. Indirect fundoscopy revealed bilateral temporal optic atrophy. SD-OCT could not be performed due to poor cooperation.\\nOther than dry eyes, there was no refractive error and the pupillary responses were normal for all the children. We were able to perform optic nerve functions in three of our patients, which included visual acuity, color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) and confrontation test. All five cases clinically showed temporal optic atrophy on slit lamp examination, indirect ophthalmoscopy and OCT.", "age": "[[4.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28371804': 1, '30381913': 1, '31142422': 1, '29492088': 2, '30612286': 1, '25449935': 1, '15217518': 1, '21656342': 1, '17595484': 1, '31271744': 1, '29312125': 1, '31695556': 1, '29255950': 1, '1957169': 1, '33437289': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7794165-1': 2, '7794165-2': 2, '7794165-3': 2, '7794165-4': 2, '5768854-1': 1}"}
