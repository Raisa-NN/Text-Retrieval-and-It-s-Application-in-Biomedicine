CT scans before surgery did not reveal signs of femoral neck fracture (Fig. ). The right femoral shaft fracture was treated with open reduction and internal fixation. The left femoral shaft fracture was treated with closed reduction and elastic intramedullary nail fixation. During the operation, the left femoral neck fracture was found with a slight displacement. After closure and reduction, 2 4.0 mm cannulated screws were used to fix the fracture (Fig. ). Postoperative plaster external fixation was maintained for 6 weeks. The internal fixation was removed after 1 year (Fig. ). At the 3-year follow-up, the child had resumed normal activities and the left hip was completely painless. There was no necrosis or varus deformity in the femoral head (Fig. ).", "age": "[[5.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19264709': 1, '15351672': 1, '24809809': 1, '22562084': 2, '24131459': 1, '12011697': 1, '8113267': 1, '16456459': 1, '15794970': 1, '15069142': 1, '2915035': 1, '27261972': 1, '17012428': 1, '26507293': 1, '15867019': 1, '22162793': 1, '23702305': 2, '20490791': 1, '33530163': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7850742-1': 2, '3667384-1': 1, '3666926-1': 1}"}
