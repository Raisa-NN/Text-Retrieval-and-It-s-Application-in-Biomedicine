He had two episodes of febrile convulsions in the past 1 year. The episodes would begin with sudden onset vomiting accompanied by cyanosis and moderate to high-grade fever. After the vomiting, he would develop deviation of eyes to one side lasting for approximately 30 min. This was followed by loss of consciousness of variable duration, ranging from 1 h to 12 h. After the second episode, electroencephalogram (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid studies, and neuroimaging were done which were normal. He was not started on any prophylactic antiepileptic medications, and a diagnosis of atypical febrile convulsions was made. His birth and developmental history was normal. There was no family history of epilepsy. On admission, he was febrile with mild congestion in the throat. Rest of the general and systemic examination was normal. He was started on symptomatic treatment after admission. At 0400 h in the night, he developed high-grade fever and vomiting. This was followed by bluish discoloration of the extremities, tachypnea, and deviation of both eyes to the right side. The episode lasted for about 10\u201315 min. He was unresponsive during the entire episode. He passed a large quantity of loose stools, had the second episode of vomiting, and became drowsy after the episode. His temperature was 39.9\u00b0C, oxygen saturation 90%, blood pressure 72/30 mmHg, respiratory rate 39/min, and heart rate 220/min. Fluid resuscitation was done, and high flow oxygen was started. Loading dose of phenytoin (20 mg/kg) was administered. His electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. He was shifted to Intensive Care Unit for observation and monitoring. Within 2 h, he started regaining consciousness and became hemodynamically stable. Within 5 h of the episode, he was fully conscious with a normal neurological examination. After 24 h, he was shifted out to the pediatric ward. Complete blood count, serum electrolytes, blood gases, serum calcium, serum magnesium, and glucose levels were within normal ranges. Blood and urine culture were normal. C-reactive protein was 0.2 mg/L (normal <5). He was discharged after 3 days from the hospital. Phenytoin was continued for 3 days after discharge and stopped. The manifestation during the episode was similar to that seen in septic shock. However, the rapid recovery, normal investigations, and previous history of similar episodes ruled out septic shock. On follow-up after 2 months, he was asymptomatic and had a normal neurological examination. Neuroimaging and EEG were normal.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25737964': 1, '12028961': 1, '16950946': 1, '19233315': 1, '18515936': 1, '22014581': 1, '23112246': 1, '21822089': 1, '22844767': 1, '22815554': 1, '11422340': 1, '27390462': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
