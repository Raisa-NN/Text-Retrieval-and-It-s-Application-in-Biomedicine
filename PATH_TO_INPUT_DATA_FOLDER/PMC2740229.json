There was no history of fever, abdominal pain or any other systemic disease. Physical examination revealed a deep umbilicus with a barely visible opening. There was no redness, edema, or crusting of the periumbilical skin. The deeper aspect of the umbilicus was exposed by using a spatula. A dark, rounded polypoid mass was noted. The clinical impression was that of fibro-epithelial polyp or some other tumor. An attempt was made to remove the mass by excising the base; however, the mass easily came out of the umbilical cavity implying that either it was necrotic or it was not firmly attached to the umbilical tissue at the base. The gray-tan 0.8 cm size round mass on cut section revealed white fibrous appearance. On microscopic examination, it was composed of lint material with typical morphology of refractile bean-shaped and elongated colorless structures, red spindle-shaped keratin material, granular red debris, rare hair fragments and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (). Under polarized light, the lint particles showed brilliant blue-green birefringence (). A diagnosis of \u2018lint ball\u2019 omphalitis was made.\\nThe patient remained completely asymptomatic at the follow-up visit one month later.", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17907979': 1, '7610752': 1, '12370721': 1, '24419812': 1, '32664180': 1, '25940433': 1, '16096864': 1, '19231087': 1, '2765801': 1, '19830013': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
