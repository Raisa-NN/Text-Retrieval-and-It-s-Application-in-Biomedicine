He was managed with mechanical ventilation and received parenteral nutrition, diuretics and anti-microbial therapy. His renal function deteriorated in the 11th week following hospitalization, he began haemodialysis, 3 times per week, through a left internal jugular venous catheter. In the 49th week, he developed a fever of 39 \u00b0C, and blood culture were collected. He was treated with empirical meropenem and his fever resolved after 3 days. His blood culture were positive for C. parapsilosis after 7 days, however, due to his clinical improvement he was not given any antifungal therapy (Fig. ). In the 52nd week, the left internal jugular venous catheter was removed, and an arteriovenous fistula was created in the forearm using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft to allow hemodialysis. In the 66th week, he became febrile and a sputum smear showed a large amount of yeast, with culture positive for C. glabrata. CT scan of the chest showed nodules in the right upper lobe and bilateral pleural effusion. He was treated for a pulmonary fungal infection, with fluconazole (100 mg/day, renal dose adjusted) (Fig. ). While still on the antifungal therapy, C. parapsilosis susceptible to fluconazole was isolated from blood culture in the 71st week following admission. In the subsequent 9 weeks the patient had intermittent fevers. There were 4 other blood cultures positive for C. parapsilosis, consistent with an intravascular source of infection (Fig. ). The final two isolates (PU123 and PU127) were resistant to fluconazole and had intermediate susceptibility to voriconazole.\\nAntifungal treatment received by the patient and isolated strains are summarized in Fig. . Due to fluconazole treatment failure, it was changed to intraconazole (100 mg/day) in the 74th week. This was ceased in the 76th week and fluconazole was recommenced at a higher dose (200 mg/day). As a possible source of infection, the synthetic arteriovenous fistula was removed in the 78th week. However, the candidemia persisted and in the 80th week caspofungin (50 mg/day) was commenced.\\nIn the 81st week, the patient became comatosed (Glasogow Coma Scale 5) with hypertonia, a positive Babinski sign, and neck rigidity, indicative of central nervous system infection or metabolic encephalopathy. No further investigations were performed, as treatment was withdrawn following discussion with the patient\u2019s family. The patient died in the 82nd week of admission.\\nThe use of the isolates in the present study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (No. S-263). We have obtained the writing consent from the control patients to publish the case report.\\nThere were 6 blood culture isolates from the patient described in the case study (patient 1). In addition, 6 isolates of C. parapsilosis obtained from the other patients (patients 2\u20137) in the PUMCH during the hospitalization of patient 1 were studied for control purpose. Identification of C. parapsilosis was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the D1/D2 domain of the 28S rRNA gene, using a published protocol [].\\nSensititre YeastOne YO10 broth microdilution susceptibility panels (TREK Diagnostic Systems, Westlake, Ohio) were used to test the susceptibility of C. parapsilosis to antifungal agents, according to a published protocol []. For C. parapsilosis, the interpretation of fluconazole, voriconazole and three echinocandins susceptibilities was done in accordance with CLSI M27-S4 []. Table summarizes the in vitro susceptibility results of the 12 C. parapsilosis isolates. There was no significant difference in the drugs tested except for fluconazole and voriconazole. The isolates from patients 2\u20137 were susceptible to fluconazole (MICs 0.25-0.5 \u03bcg/mL) and voriconazole (MICs \u22640.008 \u03bcg/mL) (Table ). For patient 1, isolates PU017, PU110, PU112 and PU116 were susceptible to fluconazole (MICs 2 \u03bcg/mL) and voriconazole (MICs 0.015-0.03 \u03bcg/mL), but with higher MICs than the other susceptible strains. Isolates PU123 and PU127 were resistant to fluconazole (MICs 32 \u03bcg/mL) and had intermediate susceptibility to voriconazole (MICs 0.5 \u03bcg/mL) (Table ).\\nAll the strains were genotyped using the highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, B5, CP1, CP4 and CP6 []. Amplification reactions were performed as previously reported []. The microsatellite multilocus genotypes allowed the differentiation of the 12 strains from 7 patients into 6 different genotypes. The 6 isolates from patient 1 involved a single genotype (genotype A). The strains isolated from control patients 2\u20134 and 6, 7 were assigned to genotypes B to G based on the observed differences. Isolate PU106 from the control patient 5 showed the same pattern on microsatellite sequence analysis as the isolates from patient 1 and designated genotype A (Table ).\\nPrimers used for PCR amplification of MRR1, TAC1, UPC2, and ERG11 genes were listed in Table (11). After alignment of the MRR1 sequences from the 12 isolates, a single nucleotide mutation (T2957C/WT) was detected in PU017, PU110, PU112 and PU116 compared with the MRR1 sequence of C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 and the control strain with the same pattern on microsatellite typing, PU106 genotype A (Table ). This mutation results in the replacement of a leucine amino acid residue with a proline (L986P). In the PU123 and PU127 isolates from patient 1, mutations were found in both alleles (T2957C/T2957C). After alignment of TAC1, UPC2, and ERG11 gene sequences from the 12 isolates, no mutation was found.\\nOvernight C. parapsilosis cultures were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.2 in YPD medium and then incubated at 35 \u00b0C with shaking at 150 rpm for additional 6 h to mid-log phase. Total RNA was extracted from isolates grown in YPD medium using the Yeast RNAiso Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The quantitative real-time RT-PCRs were performed in triplicate using the SsoFast EvaGreen supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) on a BioRad CFX96 system. ATCC 22019 were used as the control isolate. The primers used in this study were listed in Table [, , ]. The ACT1 gene was used as the endogenous control. The change in fold expression was obtained by calculating 2-\u0394\u0394, and a change of 2.5 times was considered to be overexpressed []. The 2 resistant isolates from patient 1 had higher expression levels of MRR1 than the four susceptible isolates from patient 1 (PU123 10.5-fold and PU127 9.5-fold; Fig. ). The 4 susceptible isolates showed higher expression levels (>2.5 fold) than the controls. The MDR1 expression was further increased in the resistant isolates (PU123 51.0-fold and PU127 39.4-fold). In contrast, the CDR1, UPC2, ERG11 genes expression levels in the 2 azole-resistant isolates were not significantly different from the 4 susceptible isolates from patient 1 and the control isolates.\\nIn order to confirm that only MRR1 and MDR1 genes were overexpressed, we subcultured isolates in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of fluconazole, and repeated the gene expression studies. Two susceptible isolates (PU017, PU116), the 2 resistant isolates (PU123 and PU127) from patient 1, 3 control isolates (PU090, PU106 and PU131) were subcultured. All the tested isolates and the control strain ATCC 22019 were firstly incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h in RPMI 1640 (Sigma, USA). Fluconazole was then added at a concentration of 1/2 MIC and the isolates were incubated for an additional 4 h. RNA extraction and the quantitative real-time RT-PCRs were performed as the previous experiment in the present study.\\nThe 2 resistant isolates showed higher expression levels of MRR1 than the other isolates (PU123 3.90-fold and PU127 3.99-fold; Table ). The MDR1 expression was also obviously increased in the resistant isolates (PU123 9.70-fold and PU127 9.01-fold). Similar to the previous experiment, the CDR1, UPC2, ERG11 genes expression levels in the 2 azole-resistant isolates were not higher than other susceptible isolates.", "age": "[[82.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34550003': 1, '22196207': 1, '30235884': 1, '18463213': 1, '20220157': 1, '18199791': 1, '28127295': 1, '17983269': 1, '18577180': 1, '33746933': 1, '8239594': 1, '31042770': 1, '14699449': 1, '33785623': 1, '12084466': 1, '16452151': 1, '30389707': 1, '18854483': 1, '32050673': 1, '19957192': 1, '25451046': 1, '27942193': 1, '18955533': 1, '22411611': 1, '15590814': 1, '29354774': 1, '19821642': 1, '23035204': 1, '23221625': 1, '34221266': 1, '1669837': 1, '10817712': 1, '32612597': 1, '28870262': 1, '28138378': 1, '28167935': 1, '11901654': 1, '27941028': 1, '30018595': 1, '21518843': 1, '30814115': 1, '32526921': 1, '18809934': 1, '32690638': 1, '15313532': 1, '27820850': 1, '15673762': 1, '33353200': 1, '15590837': 1, '32824785': 1, '17569573': 1, '16801415': 1, '17684006': 1, '31044032': 1, '26282840': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
