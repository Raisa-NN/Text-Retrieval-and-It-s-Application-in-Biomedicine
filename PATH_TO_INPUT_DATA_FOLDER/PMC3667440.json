It revealed tracheal narrowing due to extrinsic compression from the tumor, in addition to complete occlusion of the left main bronchus due to endobronchial invasion. Extensive tumor debulking was performed using Nd-YAG laser and balloon bronchoplasty. A covered Ultraflex\u00ae SEMS 18 mm \u00d7 60 mm was placed into distal trachea extending into the left main bronchus. Patient completed her radiotherapy and chemotherapy course. Seven months post intervention patient, she started complaining of increasing wheeze and halitosis. Repeat bronchoscopy revealed tumor ingrowths into the stent, broken stent wires, and a tracheo-mediastinal fistula noted at distal end of the stent. Laser photoresection was done to maintain stent patency. A week later she developed hemoptysis and CT of the chest revealed pneumo-mediastinum from tracheo-mediastinal fistula with irregular medial contour of the aortic arch consistent with invasion of the aorta [] requiring transition to hospice care.", "age": "[[65.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'14502148': 1, '16733189': 1, '8511297': 1, '17934107': 1, '15346210': 1, '12218821': 1, '20172440': 1, '15947327': 1, '14605078': 1, '10714025': 1, '27815921': 2, '10580974': 1, '16798229': 1, '20555225': 1, '32855792': 2, '1384448': 1, '15467599': 1, '29707506': 1, '1859081': 1, '11780299': 1, '19131533': 1, '17954110': 1, '23741275': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3667440-1': 2, '3667440-2': 2, '3667440-3': 2, '3667440-4': 2, '5097054-1': 1, '7444613-1': 1}"}
