The patient did not have high fever. The skin rash presented as a slightly exudative erythema on the extremities and the body relatively symmetrically without erosions on mucosa and sterile pustules, and were classified as grade 3 according to CTCAE (Fig. ). There was no Nikolsky\u2019s sign. No other drugs were changed or added, except for apalutamide. A skin biopsy of the chest revealed spongiosis of the epidermis without necrotic keratinocytes, as well as perivascular and interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes and a few eosinophils in the upper dermis. Vacuolar changes in the dermo-epidermal interface were not prominent. (Fig. ). A histological evaluation eliminated SAEs, which support continuation of apalutamide. Thereafter, the skin rash improved with discontinuation of apalutamide; however, 49 days after re-administration with the two dose reductions, the patient developed grade 1 erythema. The skin eruption was controlled to within tolerable levels for 8 months without apalutamide discontinuation in combination with an oral antihistamine. The medication was switched to darolutamide as requested by the patient due to apalutamide-associated skin rash (Fig. ; Table ).", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27421110': 1, '17300272': 1, '32907777': 1, '33425798': 1, '33559145': 1, '32662533': 1, '31150574': 1, '32878613': 1, '32561663': 1, '7249508': 1, '31538772': 1, '34497989': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8413224-1': 2}"}
