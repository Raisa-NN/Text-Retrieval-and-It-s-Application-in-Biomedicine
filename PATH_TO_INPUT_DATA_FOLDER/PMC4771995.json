Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a 45-mm-diameter mass in the lower right lung lobe and a 25-mm-diameter swollen anterior mediastinal lymph node adjoined the anterior side of the SVC. The patient was clinically diagnosed with T2aN2M0 lung cancer. The patient had interstitial pneumonia and elected to undergo surgical resection of the tumor instead of chemoradiotherapy.\\nThrough a posterolateral thoracotomy in the fifth intercostal space, a right middle and lower sleeve lobectomy was performed prior to the lymphadenectomy. An enlarged anterior mediastinal lymph node infiltrated the anterior wall of the SVC. The lymph node was excised with the anterior SVC wall between the brachiocephalic vein junction and the azygos vein junction. The SVC wall defect measured 30 \u00d7 7 mm and was covered with a left brachiocephalic vein, as in Case 1. The clamping time of the SVC was 45 min. The postoperative course was uneventful. Patency of the reconstructed SVC was confirmed on contrast-enhanced CT 1 month postoperatively (Fig. C).", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17184668': 1, '18498851': 1, '19632380': 1, '20682629': 1, '26932999': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4771995-1': 2}"}
