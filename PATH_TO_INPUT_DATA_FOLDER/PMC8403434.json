Preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) incidentally revealed a double left BCV (Fig. ). The left subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein merged to form the left BCV, which then divided into two branches: the normal and accessory left BCVs. The accessory left BCV was tortuous and passed across the front of the ascending aorta. Both the left BCVs drained into the superior vena cava at a level higher than the azygos vein. Following a median sternotomy, anterior mediastinal tissue was carefully dissected and the accessory left BCV was easily identified. The left accessory BCV passed across the heart and ascending aorta in front of the pericardium and drained into the superior vena cava at the same level as the normal left BCV (Fig. ). Prior to opening the pericardium, the accessory left BCV was surgically ligated and divided (Fig. ), because the normal left BCV was patent. Subsequently, an aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting to the left anterior descending artery using the left internal mammary artery was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, without any complications from the ligation of the accessory left BCV, such as upper body congestion. Histopathological examination of the resected wall of the accessory left BCV showed normal structures.", "age": "[[79.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'3527995': 1, '25037739': 1, '28849388': 1, '27186479': 2, '15788602': 1, '20830788': 1, '29318363': 1, '34454556': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4844596-1': 1}"}
