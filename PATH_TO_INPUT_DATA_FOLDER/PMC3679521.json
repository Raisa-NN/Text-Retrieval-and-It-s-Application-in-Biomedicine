For the past 31 years, the animal had been housed in an indoor/outdoor facility at the Central Washington University Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute. The animal was maintained in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (). This chimpanzee was part of a sign language and communication research group and was closely monitored on a daily basis. There was history of a single episode of vomiting the prior week. No other premonitory signs were noted by either the research staff or clinical veterinarian. The male partner of the deceased animal inflicted postmortem integumentary wounds to the face, ventral thorax and scrotum. Differential diagnoses at presentation for postmortem examination included cardiac disease or a vascular event, such as an aneurysm, pulmonary thromboembolism, or stroke.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27506330': 1, '2666427': 1, '21837283': 1, '8843181': 1, '22546920': 1, '7722119': 1, '18269527': 1, '32600351': 1, '20635395': 1, '26884410': 1, '18724782': 1, '33326497': 1, '28418090': 1, '23604288': 1, '22330355': 1, '20412692': 1, '11711527': 1, '18480207': 1, '3801081': 1, '15621032': 1, '6485212': 1, '25567850': 1, '18671767': 1, '28543059': 1, '10773229': 1, '3297405': 1, '21535928': 1, '22187661': 1, '15172426': 1, '30086141': 1, '23762500': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
