Past medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction 1 year ago requiring coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with lateral internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending artery (LAD), SVG to first diagonal, ramus intermedius (RI) and right coronary artery (RCA). After surgery, patient started complaining of above-mentioned symptoms and was initially treated with up-titration of antianginal therapy without relief of his symptoms. Patient was admitted to our facility with unstable angina. Physical examination was unremarkable. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm and no acute ST segment abnormalities concerning for ischemia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal right and left ventricular size and function, grade I diastolic dysfunction and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Right heart catheterization showed significant step-up of oxygen saturation from inferior vena cava and underwent right and left heart catheterization which showed native three-vessel atherosclerotic coronary artery disease including 99% mid LAD, 30% proximal circumflex, and 100% proximal RI. There is 50% to 60% diffuse RCA disease (). Fractional flow reserve (FFR) was performed for RCA diffuse disease, and measured FFR was 0.88, which was hemodynamically non-significant. LIMA to LAD, and SVGs to D1 and RI were patent. SVG destined to RCA was anastomosed to an anomalous right coronary vein which drained into right atrium (). Coronary computed tomography showed patent SVG to small right coronary vein with flow distal into the right atrium (). The RCA coursed immediately subjacent to the right coronary vein, though the graft did not anastomose to the RCA. Patent SVG to RI and diagonal branches was observed. Approximately 50% focal luminal narrowing of the RCA was immediately subjacent to the aforementioned anomalous vein as above. Luminal reconstitution was appreciated distal to this stenotic segment. A multidisciplinary \u201cHeart Team\u201d meeting was convened and it was decided to proceed with catheter-based coiling. Coil embolization of the SVG to right coronary vein was performed. Using a Prowater coronary wire, the guide catheter was placed in the proximal and mid segments of the graft and a Direxion 0.021 \u00d7 130 cm microcatheter was placed in mid segment of graft. Five diamond-shaped interlock-18 coils (Boston Scientific) were implanted to occlude the shunt. A subsequent angiogram revealed complete obliteration of iatrogenic aorto-right atrial shunt (). The patient\u2019s symptoms significantly improved upon follow-up.", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24826267': 2, '313762': 1, '8398193': 1, '1084732': 1, '10896560': 1, '4731120': 1, '10216016': 1, '19903688': 1, '6969649': 1, '34434374': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4008282-1': 1}"}
