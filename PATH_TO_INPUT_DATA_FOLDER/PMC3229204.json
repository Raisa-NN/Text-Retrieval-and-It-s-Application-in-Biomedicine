This patient reported a history of chronic constipation for which intermittent medical treatment administered for 2 years had failed. Clinical examination found a cachectic child with an extremely distended abdomen, and a palpable abdominopelvic mass. Biological assessments including the blood cell count, alpha-fetoprotein and the beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (B-HCG) were all normal. A full abdominal X-ray showed a bowel loop displaced by a mass in the soft tissues (). Ultrasonography revealed an abdominal multiloculated septated cystic mass measuring 20 cm in diameter. CT-scan revealed a septated cystic abdominopelvic mass (). The laparotomy was performed, and a huge mesenteric tumor containing 5 litters of clear fluid was discovered (), followed by the resection of the involved bowel and the mesenteric tumor ( ). A primary anastomosis was performed, and the diagnosis of cystic lymphangioma was revealed by histological and immune-histo-chemical studies of the surgical piece. The surgical follow-up was uneventful and the clinical evolution was very favorable 6 years post-surgery.", "age": "[[12.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8735047': 1, '9927769': 1, '8832938': 1, '33636409': 2, '12094416': 1, '15508873': 1, '8861480': 1, '11819071': 1, '15892005': 1, '8182097': 1, '22145071': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7918257-1': 1}"}
