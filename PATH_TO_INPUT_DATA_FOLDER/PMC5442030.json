CT imaging showed a hypovascular tumor (29 mm in diameter) in the pancreatic head (Fig. ). The tumor widely contacted the IVC wall; however, there were no signs of obvious invasion. PDAC was suspected and she underwent PD. Intraoperative findings revealed a stiff attachment between the tumor and the IVC. Wedge resection of the IVC wall was performed using side clamping. In addition, combined resection and reconstruction of the SMV was performed because of suspicion for SMV invasion. Pathological findings of the surgical specimen revealed tumor infiltration of the adventitia of the IVC (Fig. ). Surgical margins including IVC resection end were negative; however, tumor metastases to the para-aortic lymph nodes were identified. The postoperative course was uneventful, and she underwent systemic chemotherapy (Gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2) beginning on POD 34. She experienced multiple liver metastases, bone metastasis 10 months after surgery, and died 16 months after recurrence (Fig. ).", "age": "[[68.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21331805': 1, '26951889': 1, '23376028': 1, '18471707': 1, '21924855': 1, '16003309': 1, '26972858': 1, '24649185': 1, '2341122': 1, '24856119': 1, '23622141': 1, '28537015': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5442030-1': 2, '5442030-2': 2}"}
