Seven months ago, the patient was admitted to another hospital, and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 14-mm nodule and loculated effusion in left lower lung field. Under the diagnosis of empyema, drainage of pleural fluid concomitant with antibiotics therapy was performed and left pleural effusion and a lung nodule disappeared. However, the symptoms had recurred three months ago and persisted despite antibiotic treatment, and the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. The patient had previously been healthy with no significant history of lung disease, other than a previously documented empyema and a lung nodule, and has smoked 20 cigarettes a day for 40 years. He was in mild respiratory distress, respiratory rate 24/min, temperature 37.6\u2103, and pulse 82/min. The lung sound was slightly diminished over left lower lung field.\\nFindings of laboratory studies showed a white-blood-cell count of 18,000/mm3 with 76.6% neutrophils, hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL, and platelet count 462,000/mm3. Electrolytes, measures of renal function, and liver enzymes were within normal limits. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated to 15.34 mg/dL. Serologic test for human immunodeficiency virus gave negative result. Initial blood and sputum cultures remained negative, but the patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (18 g per day) and ciprofloxacin (800 mg per day) as an empirical antibacterial therapy. Chest X-ray showed the ill-defined patchy mass opacity with surrounding ground-glass opacity in left mid-lung field (). Chest CT showed huge mass-like consolidation in the lingular segment of left upper lobe and enlarged bilateral supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes, suggestive of malignancy or inflammatory disease ().\\nDuring five days of antibiotic treatment, neither clinical nor radiologic improvement was observed. Brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and endobronchial ultrasoundguided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for paratracheal and subcarinal lymph nodes were performed, and the findings were unremarkable. The patient remained febrile after seven days of initial antibiotic therapy, and the regimen was changed to meropenem (3 g per day) and vancomycin (2 g per day). In addition to respiratory symptoms, the patient complained of back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic and lumbar spine was performed and showed diffuse heterogenous low signal change with heterogenous enhancement (). From this MRI finding, marrow infiltrative diseases such as multiple myeloma, malignant lymphoma, and multiple metastasis of unknown origin were considered. There was no evidence of monoclonal gammopathy based on serum and urine electrophoresis. FDG PET was performed and maximum intensity projection image showed multifocal hypermetabolic lesion in the lingular segment of left upper lung, bilateral supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes, spleen, and multiple bones, including spine, right humerus, both scapula, left clavicle, sternum, sacrum, both pelvic bones, both femurs, and both side ribs (). At this point, we had a high suspicion of hidden malignancy and performed percutaneous needle biopsy (PCNB) in the left upper lobe consolidation and left supraclavicular lymph node. However, both pathologies revealed nonspecific chronic inflammation and interstitial fibrosis and there was no evidence of malignancy or granulomas. Then, CT-guided bone biopsy was performed in the first lumbar vertebrae, and the pathology showed myeloid hyperplasia with marked plasmacytosis, without the evidence of malignant cell infiltration.\\nFrom the day of admission, serial sputum specimens were collected and cultured for mycobacteria using both mycobacteria growth indicator tuve (MGIT; Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA) and Ogawa (Korean Institute of Tuberculosis, Seoul, Korea) media. On the day 30 of admission, acid-fast bacilli were repeatedly cultured in MGIT media and then in Ogawa media, which were identified as nontuberculous mycobacteria. Subsequent cultures from previous BAL and PCNB of left upper lobe consolidation specimens also were identified as nontuberculous mycobacterium. On the day 37 of admission, M. intracellulare was identified, and anti-MAC treatment was initiated with clarithromycin (1 g per day), rifampicin (600 mg per day), ethambutol (800 mg per day), and streptomycin (1 g per day). Even though the bone biopsy specimen did not reveal acid-fast bacilli, the reverse blot hybridization assay (REBA Myco-ID\u00ae; Molecules and Diagnostics, Wonju, Korea) using bone biopsy specimen revealed M. intracellulare. Later, M. intracellulare was also identified from bone biopsy specimen.\\nFrom these radiological and microbiological findings, the diagnosis of disseminated M. intracellulare infection was made. Anti-MAC therapy was continued and the patient was discharged with improved symptoms on the day 63 of admission. The drug sensitivity test revealed that the organism was susceptible to clarithromycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration of clarithromycin was 1 mg/L (susceptible). Unfortunately, additional information after discharge was not available due to transfer to another hospital.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9647121': 1, '19204556': 1, '17054802': 2, '17277290': 1, '1349906': 1, '12924501': 1, '28418290': 1, '26201464': 2, '18810690': 1, '9279284': 1, '20445335': 1, '17204697': 1, '11317033': 1, '19787313': 1, '34786338': 2, '33865452': 2, '20930438': 1, '20849364': 1, '23101011': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8053279-1': 1, '8577481-1': 1, '4511996-1': 1, '1634852-1': 1}"}
