Echocardiography revealed tetralogy of Fallot, severely obstructed and hypoplastic right ventricular outflow tract with small PDA. Pt was intubated and PGE-1 infusion started thereafter. Dopamine (5 mcg/kg/min) was initiated in view of hemodynamic instability. The patient was scheduled for emergency RMBTS as there was little improvement in SpO2 despite maximal dose of PGE-1.\\nBilateral frontal cerebral oximetry was monitored along with standard ASA monitoring and patient was positioned in the right thoracotomy position. Baseline rScO2 postinduction was 76 (left) and 77 (right side) on FiO2 of 0.7 with MAP of 40 mmHg.\\nNo change in rScO2 values was noted when the clamp was applied on right subclavian artery to construct proximal anastomosis. For constructing distal anastomosis, RPA was isolated by occluding the first order branches and proximal RPA sequentially. On proximal RPA clamping rScO2 value decreased to significant levels (right rScO260 and left rScO264) with subsequent fall in SpO2 (60%) though MAP of 60 mmHg was maintained.\\nThe fall in NIRS was communicated to the surgical team who noticed a right-sided ductal insertion which compromised pulmonary blood flow by application of proximal RPA clamp, thereby reducing flow to pulmonary circulation [].", "age": "[[3.0, 'day']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16430416': 1, '23144435': 1, '15502032': 1, '28882917': 1, '19076569': 1, '18249339': 1, '9375600': 1, '25934116': 1, '31929257': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7034197-1': 2}"}
