She was a nonsmoker without history of pulmonary disease. She was placed under general anesthesia and mechanically ventilated using JET. After isolating the pulmonary veins, 18 mg of adenosine was administered. Atrioventricular block and acute reconnection of the left superior PV were observed. Immediately following adenosine administration, the peak inspiratory pressure increased and oxygen saturation decreased from 99% to 78%. Auscultation demonstrated bilateral expiratory wheeze. Albuterol was administered with subsequent improvement in ventilation and recovery of oxygenation. Additional ablation lesions were delivered at the site of acute reconnection, following which 18 mg of adenosine was administered a second time. Again, she immediately developed bronchospasm, with increased peak inspiratory pressures and decreased oxygen saturation, which resolved within minutes following albuterol administration. The procedure was successfully concluded without further administration of adenosine.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15679135': 1, '26211828': 1, '26321237': 1, '10403886': 1, '22177587': 1, '19263201': 1, '27759898': 1, '25012971': 1, '23697189': 1, '25972302': 1, '28588802': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5458041-1': 2}"}
