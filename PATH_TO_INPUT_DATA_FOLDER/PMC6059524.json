On exam, the patient was unable to fully extend the left knee. He had a marked effusion without warmth or erythema. The patient was neurovascularly intact throughout. Radiographs of the left knee were performed which demonstrated cortical irregularity of the medial tibial plateau consistent with medial tibial plateau fracture. Given the extent of the edema and limitation in range of motion of the knee, the decision to perform a POCUS was made to assess for further injury.\\nThe ultrasound examination was performed by the treating emergency physician using a 12-4 MHz linear array transducer. The examination revealed significant hemarthrosis of the left knee. The patellar tendon showed no evidence of rupture. A bony avulsion over the anterior tibial spine was visualized that had not been noted on initial radiography in the ED (Figure ).\\nThe patient was seen by orthopedics in the ED. After evaluation of the patient and discussion of the ultrasound findings, the radiographs were reviewed once again and it appeared that there was likely a missed anterior tibial spine fracture. The patient was placed in a knee immobilizer and discharged with strict instructions to follow up with orthopedics for outpatient surgery.", "age": "[[31.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1985991': 1, '28945690': 1, '21406322': 1, '22018313': 1, '7358751': 1, '581764': 1, '29367903': 1, '19308544': 1, '8739720': 1, '18408944': 1, '3958174': 1, '30050732': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6059524-1': 2}"}
