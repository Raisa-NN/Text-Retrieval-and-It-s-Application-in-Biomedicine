There were no medical or surgical problems in her history. In physical examination, she was a very thin girl with distended abdomen, mucosal pallor, and temporal wasting. Rectal examination revealed a 1.5-cm rectal pouch with scanty malodorous discharge. Abdomen had doughy consistency in favor of huge fecal impaction. She underwent a loop sigmoid colostomy with postoperative proximal and distal irrigation to remove the massive tarry stool. In the postoperative distal loopogram, a huge megarectum and a high wind sock rectal atresia (bulging membrane with tiny aperture) was found []. The patient's general condition and appetite had improved in the following two months. Thereafter, she underwent an abdominoperineal pull-through operation and protecting colostomy. In the second operation, a small clamp was passed through tiny central aperture via anal canal and a large rectal tube was easily pulled through the central hole, which made the membrane to be ruptured []. However, proximal resection of megacolon and pull-through of normal bowel was performed. We closed the colostomy after obtaining a normal distal loopogram [] and the histology revealing normal ganglion cells in resected margin. The patient was discharged with good bowel function and continence.", "age": "[[2.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'7120014': 1, '6502436': 1, '8749936': 1, '16398879': 1, '18022423': 1, '17208536': 1, '2352088': 1, '28601898': 1, '19568581': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
