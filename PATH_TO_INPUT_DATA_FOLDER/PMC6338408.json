Initially the lump was painless but recently became symptomatic. Examination revealed a large left breast mass measuring 14 cm x 12 cm involving the medial upper quadrant with overlying skin erythema (Figures , ).\\nAxillary lymph nodes were not palpable. Right breast exam was within normal limits. Ultrasound confirmed the physical exam findings. Core needle biopsy was performed which came back positive for invasive mucinous carcinoma.\\nThe patient was started on neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. After multiple cycles of chemotherapy, the tumor did not show any regression. With no response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, decision was made to proceed with left modified radical mastectomy (Figures , ).\\nSurgical pathology showed resected margins to be free of tumor (Figure ). All the lymph nodes were negative of carcinoma. The tumor was ER/PR positive and HER2/neu negative and was staged T3N0M0. The patient did well after the surgery. She received adjuvant chemotherapy and started on aromatase inhibitor.", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'7148748': 1, '2545592': 1, '15039190': 1, '7618541': 1, '34984023': 1, '8165985': 1, '12720107': 1, '16518069': 1, '29658333': 1, '30680267': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
