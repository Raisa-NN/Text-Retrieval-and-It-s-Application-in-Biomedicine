Chest radiography demonstrated a mass in the right chest and a subsequent CT scan revealed a large anterior mediastinal mass extending mostly into the right hemithorax and compressing the right lung. The radiological appearances were consistent with a teratoma (Fig. ). The CT scan also revealed abdominal lymphadenopathy, which on biopsy proved to be non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The lymphoma was successfully treated with chemotherapy, without any change in the lung mass. Nevertheless, surgical excision of this mass was indicated due to its large size.\\nThe patient underwent a median sternotomy whereupon a giant fatty tumour was found arising superficially from the medial border of the right lung occupying most of the right chest and extending to the anterior mediastinum. The mass was compressing the right lung with no evidence of local invasion. The right phrenic nerve was identified and preserved, and the tumour was found to be adherent to the medial border of the lung and was easily dissected with sharp dissection and removed en bloc. The postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on the seventh postoperative day. Six months postoperatively the patient remains well. The final histology of the tumour, measuring 25.5 \u00d7 17.5 \u00d7 6.5 cm, and weighing 1134 g (Fig. ), was a pulmonary hamartoma with predominantly adipose and leiomyomatous differentiation.", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23531937': 1, '33552326': 2, '954458': 1, '8538225': 1, '28050379': 1, '8302082': 1, '34776670': 1, '20605822': 1, '30719262': 2, '2407277': 1, '12114359': 1, '3321538': 1, '29202683': 2, '20058139': 1, '25922744': 1, '16887035': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5933581-1': 1, '7847404-1': 1, '6348499-1': 1}"}
