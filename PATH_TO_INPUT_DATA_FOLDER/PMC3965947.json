He was referred to our department in March 2012 because of a suspected hypopharyngeal tumor. According to the patient's previous medical history, he suffered from hypertension, had smoked 15 cigarettes per day for 50 years, and consumed alcohol at the rate of 3 L of beer per day. During the initial examination, a tumor lesion was found on the posterior wall of the hypopharynx (). Enlargement of bilateral retropharyngeal lymph nodes was seen on computed tomography (CT), whereas on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lesion infiltration from the posterior wall of hypopharynx to the prevertebral muscles was observed (). Squamous cell carcinoma was identified on the basis of biopsy findings, and stage IVb, T4bN2cM0 posterior hypopharyngeal wall carcinoma was diagnosed.\\nRadical CCRT was performed from April to June 2012. The total radiation therapy dose was 70 Gy, which included a dose of 40 Gy to the whole neck field, followed by an additional 30 Gy to the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes. Cisplatin (70 mg/m2) plus 5-fluorouracil (700 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) was administered in 2 courses. The lesion disappeared after treatment completion, but the dysphagia did not improve. The patient was discharged after a jejunostomy was established.\\nAfter discharge, the patient was followed up and TS-1 was administered as maintenance therapy; however, he experienced a sore throat in November 2012 (5 months after completing CCRT). A recurrence was suspected because visual examination had revealed necrosis of the hypopharyngeal mucosa and incompetence of the vocal cord opening, and thus, the patient was admitted for the second time. Tracheotomy and hypopharyngoscopy revealed extensive necrosis on the posterior wall of the hypopharynx. Pathological examination of the same area did not show the presence of any malignant cells. Because a gas pattern was observed in the prevertebral area on CT images, an infection was suspected. The patient was treated with meropenem (1.5 g/day) for 1 week. He was discharged following improvement in local findings and the sore throat.\\nIn January 2013 (7 months after completing CCRT), the patient experienced pain in both shoulders and the anterior chest, as well as reduced muscle strength in his 4 limbs. He was admitted for the third time for the purpose of close examination. A large mucosal defect was observed on the posterior wall of the hypopharynx. A blood examination revealed a leukocyte count of 10,900/\u03bcL and a CRP level of 17.7 mg/dL, suggesting a strong inflammatory reaction; however, no accumulation was observed on bone scintigraphy. Cervical spine osteomyelitis and an epidural abscess on C4-C7 were observed on MRI (). The causative bacteria were not identified in a pharyngeal culture. Because the reduced muscle strength worsened despite the administration of meropenem, we discussed treatment for this case with the Orthopedic Surgery Department. We concluded that surgical treatment carried a high risk, and therefore, the patient underwent 25 rounds of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO). The abscess gradually reduced and muscle strength improved, and the patient was subsequently discharged (). A defect of the posterior hypopharyngeal wall was also gradually improved. No recurrence has been noted and the patient is followed in outpatient.", "age": "[[68.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17364352': 1, '19200678': 1, '16024955': 1, '19340464': 1, '15020372': 1, '20585930': 1, '22495686': 1, '10609488': 1, '26715867': 1, '15236869': 1, '16370306': 1, '7045303': 1, '31742064': 1, '24711945': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
