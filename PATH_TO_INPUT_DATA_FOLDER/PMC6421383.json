B-ultrasound showed that she had an enlarged uterus with uterine\\nleiomyoma. A uterus-preserving surgery was discussed with this patient. However,\\nthe patient had no fertility requirement. Therefore, total abdominal\\nhysterectomy and bilateral ovarian biopsy were performed. Pathology showed no\\ntumors in both ovaries, which were preserved. A round, gray-red mass with a size\\nof 3.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm was found on the right lateral wall of the uterus. The tumor\\nboundary was unclear and invaded the gland on the surface of the endometrium,\\nwhich was intact. After a retrospective review of the microscopic and\\nmacroscopic features of the specimens by pathologists, the patient was\\nhistologically diagnosed with UTROSCT as shown by CD99, SMA, calretinin,\\nvimentin, and desmin expression. However, CK or Ki-67 was not expressed. Gross\\nand pathological sections were not clear when these were collected during the\\ntime of the diagnosis. At a postoperative telephone follow-up after 12 years,\\nthe patient was still alive without evidence of recurrence.", "age": "[[33.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9602683': 1, '20070149': 1, '34447841': 2, '33923427': 1, '19509593': 1, '11603218': 1, '21084963': 1, '18156976': 1, '17182656': 1, '11192074': 1, '12409724': 1, '12207796': 1, '26430670': 2, '19406461': 1, '25150955': 1, '32884523': 2, '961630': 1, '19249718': 1, '3943854': 1, '16118629': 1, '18425046': 1, '24696722': 1, '27213063': 2, '12819400': 1, '24283865': 1, '11914617': 1, '18317219': 1, '11499847': 1, '16965622': 2, '15297205': 1, '12610103': 1, '16175078': 1, '26097607': 1, '18604736': 1, '14608532': 1, '14751183': 1, '30158549': 1, '16049297': 1, '4086162': 1, '10374776': 1, '18045604': 1, '20736772': 1, '12808064': 1, '27751432': 1, '30171991': 1, '10231408': 1, '9737240': 1, '28119954': 1, '8365717': 1, '30732515': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6421383-1': 2, '4861780-1': 1, '1570478-1': 1, '8362530-1': 1, '4588850-1': 1, '7443644-1': 1}"}
