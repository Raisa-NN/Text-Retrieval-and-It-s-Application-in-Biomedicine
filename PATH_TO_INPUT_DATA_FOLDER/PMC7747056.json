The patient was known to suffer from Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. He presented with a history of chronic oral ulcerations and dysphagia that had not been resolving since the first presentation. He was provisionally diagnosed with recurrent aphthous ulcers and was managed conventionally with oral antiseptics and analgesics.\\nIncisional biopsy of the buccal mucosa was performed under local anesthesia since the patient's symptoms had not improved with conventional treatment. The differential diagnosis included aphthous ulcers, mucous membrane pemphigoid, erosive lichen planus, and oral squamous cell carcinoma.\\nHistopathology demonstrated a suprabasal cleft with acantholytic cells and a focal papillaroid projection with dilapidated brick wall appearance (Fig. ). Also, the subepithelial tissues showed lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrates (Fig. ). A suggestive diagnosis of oral HHD was made. Direct immunofluorescence testing is required for confirmation, since it is a pathological diagnosis. Initially, we could not send the patient to direct immunofluorescence testing.", "age": "[[84.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25386331': 2, '31516990': 1, '31223357': 1, '31649972': 1, '27222876': 1, '31105943': 2, '30167446': 1, '22826719': 1, '31959512': 2, '33362505': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7058835-1': 1, '6501477-1': 1, '4224006-1': 1}"}
