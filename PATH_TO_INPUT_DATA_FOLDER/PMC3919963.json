CT revealed a highly enhanced 2.6 cm-sized, iceberg shaped mid-tracheal tumor involving the right-side posterolateral wall, suggesting the impression of tracheal paraganglioma (most likely), sclerosing hemangioma and leiomyoma (). On the bronchoscopic examination, a 1 cm-sized, vascular mass was noted 7 cm below the vocal cord (). However, pulmonary function test (PFT) showed no abnormal findings: forced vital capacity (FVC), 3.6 L; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), 3.13 L; and FEV1/FVC, 87%. Tracheal resection and anastomosis was done. He is well without evidence of local recurrence or complication two years after operation.", "age": "[[64.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25344687': 1, '31189773': 1, '23050181': 2, '11859201': 1, '29221350': 1, '2153371': 1, '14080348': 1, '11734464': 1, '17905464': 1, '11603225': 1, '9891244': 1, '21104079': 1, '27621844': 1, '29642190': 1, '25544269': 1, '16632723': 1, '24523816': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3459257-1': 1}"}
