The frequency was 2\u20133 spasms/cluster and 2\u20133 clusters/day. The prenatal and perinatal period was uneventful. No significant family history was observed. Examination revealed multiple ash leaf spots over left arm, right leg, and buttocks []. She also had a pink-red blotchy stain over right upper limb extending to chest and back []. Also, there was visible hypertrophy of the right upper and lower limbs []. Rest of the systemic and neurological examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed multiple cortical tubers and subependymal nodules (SEN) with calcification [Figure and ]. Echocardiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal. EEG was suggestive of hypsarrhythmia. In view of multiple tubers, SEN, and ash leaf spots (three major criteria for TSC), and right hemihypertrophy and port-wine stain (two of the classic triad of KTS), a diagnosis of TSC with KTS overlap was made. She was initiated on vigabatrin with which the spasms became passive.", "age": "[[6.0, 'month']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'31072875': 1, '21280434': 1, '168320': 1, '15509243': 1, '27470532': 1, '33042255': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
