The pain was located on radial part of the wrist and worsened by extension, abduction, or adduction of his thumb. There was no pain as far as he did not move the wrist. There was no swelling or erythema on the lesion but had tenderness on palpating over the area where abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons were located. The pain was only on dorsal side of the wrist and there was no pain or tender on palmar side. By history taking and physical examination, the diagnosis of de Quervain tenosynovitis was made. He took no medication and simply waited for spontaneous improvement of the symptoms. However, symptoms persisted and he became not able to hold heavy substances because of the pain.\\nA week later, he became aware that his symptoms worsened after he started to use newly bought iPhone X, which he obtained approximately 2 months prior to the onset of the symptoms. He held his iPhone with his right hand and texted with thumb on the same hand. He previously used to use iPhone 6, which had much smaller body and display [ and ].[] Apparently, the tendinitis was caused by use of iPhone X. after changing his habitual practice of holding his smartphone with his right hand, he started to hold his phone with his left hand, manipulating the display with his right index finger []. Symptoms gradually improved over a few weeks and became free of symptoms.", "age": "[[47.5, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21301640': 1, '17554133': 1, '20538752': 1, '31198758': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
