The patient reported myalgia, rigors, and epigastric pain for 1 month, which had worsened in the previous 7 days, at which time she travelled to Portugal. At presentation, the patient's vital signs were normal, and physical examination was remarkable for pallor and proximal weakness of the lower limbs. Blood tests on admission revealed anemia (hemoglobin 6 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 67.1 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 20.5 pg, hematocrit 19.6%, and red cell distribution width 28%), leukocyte count 8.6 \u00d7 109/L and platelet count 77 \u00d7 109/L, C-reactive protein 26.88 mg/dL, creatinine 8.36 mg/dL, and urea 141 mg/dL, with no evidence of hemolysis. The peripheral blood smear revealed trophozoites and schizonts of Plasmodium malariae, and the patient was treated with artemether/lumefantrine for 3 days, under cardiac monitoring with electrocardiogram and blood potassium monitoring. No infected erythrocytes were identified on peripheral blood smear after treatment conclusion, and no adverse events were reported.", "age": "[[56.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22515681': 1, '29027504': 1, '26236343': 2, '30891070': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4506810-1': 1}"}
