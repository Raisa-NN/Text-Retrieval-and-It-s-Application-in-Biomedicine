A breast examination revealed a palpable mass, measuring 10 cm in diameter, located in the upper lateral quadrant of the right breast and right axillary multiple lymph nodes. On ultrasonography, the mass was a 4 cm solid lesion located in heterogeneous breast parenchyma, and conglomerates of multiple axillary lymphadenopathy suspicious of malignancy were also detected (). The mammography was almost normal due to the dense parenchymal pattern, except for the presence of the axillary lymphadenopathy (). A core-needle biopsy was performed on the breast lesion, and the diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was made preoperatively. Based on the clinical suspicion of an advanced-stage breast cancer, the patient underwent a modified radical mastectomy. On postoperative histopathological assessment, the diagnosis of 8-cm high-grade DCIS was established, however no axillary lymph node metastases were detected ().", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'10921490': 1, '7480749': 1, '16490754': 1, '12381707': 1, '20040528': 1, '17348576': 1, '15226160': 1, '22323923': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
