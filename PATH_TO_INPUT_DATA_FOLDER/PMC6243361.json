The patient received adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary site.\\nHer initial MRI demonstrated the primary tumour as a large, destructive mass in the right maxillary sinus (). Restaging CT scan of the neck at 12 months showed hyperenhancing cervical lymphadenopathy (). Ultrasound examination showed hypervascular right levels 1B and 2 lymph nodes and was used to guide fine-needle aspiration, confirming metastatic olfactory neuroblastoma.\\nThe patient went on to have a right-sided comprehensive neck dissection followed by radiotherapy to the right neck. Follow-up positron emission tomography (PET) at 3 months demonstrated T10 and left humerus metastases, from which the patient was asymptomatic. Local radiotherapy was provided to the T10 metastasis. However, the bony metastases progressed within the following year and the patient subsequently died.", "age": "[[72.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20841465': 1, '25476176': 1, '23312882': 1, '24751700': 1, '23174357': 1, '24342734': 1, '19446199': 1, '22422597': 1, '24037430': 1, '21349970': 1, '11679222': 1, '21928426': 1, '33394372': 1, '22302963': 1, '25476174': 1, '19497493': 1, '24347437': 1, '23520216': 1, '21159544': 1, '21459020': 1, '24239180': 1, '30459963': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6243361-1': 2, '6243361-2': 2}"}
