She was otherwise in excellent medical condition with her only significant past medical or surgical history being cervical carcinoma in situ treated with hysterectomy at age 29. She had no history of smoking and used alcohol only on rare social occasions. In addition, there was no family history of any malignant disease. Her initial workup included laboratory investigations that were significant for hyperbilirubinemia of 8.7 mcg/dL. This was followed by computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis that revealed significant intra- and extrahepatic ductal dilatation (Fig. ) and a 2.69 \u00d7 2.64 cm mass in the head of the pancreas (Fig. ). There was no evidence of peripancreatic, periportal, mesenteric, or celiac axis adenopathy, nor was there evidence of distant metastatic disease. In addition, there was no abutment on the mass to the portal vein or the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Based on these initial CT findings, this was a resectable pancreatic head mass.\\nHer workup continued with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). These studies confirmed the presence of a mass within the head of the pancreas and demonstrated a 2-cm distal common bile duct stricture. Brushings of this area confirmed the presence of adenocarcinoma.\\nThe patient was then referred for a surgical oncology evaluation. Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was consistent with her original scan and showed no evidence of metastatic disease. Her CA 19-9 was checked and found to be elevated at 441 U/mL. Her case was discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board, and because she appeared to be resectable at presentation, surgery rather than neoadjuvant therapy was offered.\\nIn March of 2010, she was taken to the operating room where diagnostic laparoscopy revealed no evidence of metastasis and a classic pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Surgical pathology from the specimen showed a moderately differentiated infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head. The tumor measured 4.2 \u00d7 3.0 \u00d7 2.6 cm and invaded into the peripancreatic soft tissue, though all margins were negative with the closest margin being 0.3 cm. Angiolymphatic invasion was identified. Two of 16 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic disease. Per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging guidelines [], this was a T3N1b, stage III pancreatic cancer. There was no evidence that this tumor was arising from a premalignant lesion such as an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). In addition, there was no mention of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) within the pancreas or at the margin in the original pathology report.\\nPostoperatively, she received adjuvant therapy with 3 cycles of gemcitabine monotherapy followed by an additional 3 cycles of gemcitabine with erlotinib. She underwent routine follow-up with physical examination, imaging, and laboratory studies on a semiannual basis. From late 2010 after completing adjuvant therapy until March 2014, she showed no evidence of disease with multiple negative imaging studies and CA19-9 levels ranging from 12.1 to 44.5 U/mL. In March 2014, however, her CA 19-9 increased to 161.4 U/mL. A CT done at this time (Fig. ) showed a 2.1 \u00d7 2 cm mass in the body of the pancreas suspicious for recurrent or metachronous tumor. By CT, there was no evidence of disease outside of the pancreas. The CT was followed by PET-CT (Fig. ) that demonstrated this PET avid lesion in the pancreas with a maximum SUV of 5.9 g/mL with no evidence of metastatic disease, again suspicious for pancreatic cancer. The patient\u2019s case was presented at a multidisciplinary tumor conference with discussions on how to proceed with treatment, with the main questions focused on neoadjuvant therapy versus resection followed by adjuvant therapy if the mass is proven to be pancreatic carcinoma. Because of the long disease-free interval and the fact that the mass appeared resectable, the tumor board\u2019s recommendation was to proceed with surgery first.\\nIn June 2014, the patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy that did not reveal evidence of disseminated disease, followed immediately by exploratory laparotomy with completion total pancreatectomy with splenectomy. This procedure lasted just over 3 h and was completed with minimal blood loss.\\nSurgical pathology from this operation demonstrated moderately differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas measuring 3.2 \u00d7 2.3 \u00d7 2.1 cm. All margins were negative. All lymph nodes evaluated (n = 7) were negative for metastatic disease. Based on AJCC staging criteria, this metachronous tumor was T2N0 or stage IIB. The patient\u2019s hospital course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged home on postoperative day 7.\\nFollowing surgery, she received adjuvant therapy consisting of 3 cycles of gemcitabine. This was followed by chemoradiation that included 45 Gy in 25 fractions with concurrent capecitabine. She completed adjuvant therapy in October 2014, and as of March 2015, she has no clinical evidence of disease recurrence(Fig. ) and a Ca19-9 of 28.5.", "age": "[[69.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'25099441': 1, '22644446': 1, '15694823': 1, '18376190': 1, '8604907': 1, '8995078': 1, '24399786': 1, '21696765': 1, '23233235': 1, '18953246': 1, '17414605': 1, '21060713': 1, '8383381': 1, '17390170': 1, '16998244': 1, '7794076': 1, '28716115': 2, '20065550': 1, '24238124': 1, '26419361': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5513331-1': 1}"}
