Computed tomography (CT) revealed ankylosis from C2 to C7 due to DISH, slight ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at C2\u20135, and a C5/6 fracture with C5 posterior displacement []. The previously operated laminae were ankylosed and thickened on CT [Figure and ]. CT revealed a three-column fracture from the vertebral body to the ankylosed laminae [Figure and ]. The contrast-enhanced CT revealed a thick vein dorsal to the right laminae []. Magnetic resonance imaging could not be obtained because a brain clip had been implanted.\\nWe performed surgery the day after injury using a posterior approach for stabilization of the spinal column from C3 to T1. First, we stripped only the left side muscles from C3 to C5 and muscles bilaterally from C6 to T1 through a midline incision because a thick vein existed dorsal to the right laminae from C3 to C5. Translaminar screws (LS) were placed to the right (hinge side) of C3\u20137, lateral mass screws (LMS) to the left (open side) of C3\u20136, and pedicle screws (PS) to the left of C7 and bilaterally in T1. Titanium rods were assembled from C3 to T1 bilaterally [Figure -]. Bony fusion was achieved as seen on CT images 6 months after surgery []. However, no neurological improvement was observed up to 3 years postoperatively.", "age": "[[87.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24306701': 1, '16075171': 1, '25575089': 1, '29155874': 1, '22322372': 1, '18791749': 1, '26119898': 1, '20421858': 1, '30292663': 1, '29153782': 1, '22082626': 1, '25494322': 1, '33145233': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
