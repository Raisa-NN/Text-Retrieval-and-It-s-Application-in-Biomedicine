Her intraocular pressure (IOP) was well controlled (10 mmHg) with a topical beta-blocker. The remainder of her ophthalmic and general exam was otherwise normal. We performed DSAEK on the patient\u2019s left eye in order to treat her endothelial disease.\\nAt the end of her routine and uneventful DSAEK surgery, sterile filtered air was injected into the AC to tamponade the donor graft into position. On post-operative day one, slit lamp examination revealed subconjunctival air leakage inside the trabeculectomy bleb (Fig. ). The DSAEK graft was well centered and adherent to the host stoma with a 50-60% air fill remaining. IOP measured 14 mmHg and the remainder of her ocular exam was within normal limits.", "age": "[[89.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17156845': 1, '23977215': 1, '22752650': 1, '17571001': 1, '26997845': 2, '23264862': 1, '3327710': 1, '16327797': 1, '17102658': 1, '16631048': 1, '23960973': 1, '17276255': 1, '7396785': 1, '28255226': 1, '19554220': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4779949-1': 1, '4779949-2': 1, '4779949-3': 1}"}
