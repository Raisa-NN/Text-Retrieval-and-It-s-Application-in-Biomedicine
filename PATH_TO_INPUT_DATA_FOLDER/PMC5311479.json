Endoscopy revealed acute ulcerative colitis with a Mayo score of 12. He failed to respond to intravenous corticosteroid therapy, and toxic megacolon appeared. He underwent a total laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA (with a loop ileostomy). After surgery, the patient recovered without complications and was discharged 10 d after the operation. Six weeks later, he was readmitted to our department for ileostomy reversal. Prior to the operation, pouch endoscopy, antegrade Gastrografin enema, and an abdominal computed tomography scan did not reveal an abnormality. A stapled side-to-side ileostomy reversal was performed, and he was discharged 3 d after the operation. One month after the final operation, he developed a high fever again (39.9 \u00b0C) with stool leaking from the right lower abdominal trocar site. Colonoscopy and a Gastrografin enema confirmed there was a fistula on the tip of the \u201cJ\u201d Pouch (Figures and ). He was treated with percutaneous drainage, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and bowel rest. Signs of intra-abdominal sepsis were controlled after 4 wk of therapy. However, there was persistent feculent discharge from the fistula tract. The patient was comprehensively informed about the endoscopic procedure.", "age": "[[26.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21383566': 1, '23400507': 1, '21517921': 1, '22773239': 1, '24976714': 1, '19915907': 1, '34872236': 1, '24373001': 1, '18317849': 1, '33928179': 1, '28250903': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
