Intraoral examination revealed a swelling of the vestibule of the mouth, extending from the mesial side of the right canine to the distal side of the right second premolar.\\nInitial radiological examination on the panoramic radiograph depicted a poorly circumscribed expansible radiolucency. A biopsy was performed, and the pathologic diagnosis was odontogenic keratocyst. Prior to enucleation of the cyst with extraction of the involved tooth, a 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) image was requested (). Inspection of the CT image revealed the presence of double mental foramen. Of the mental foramina, the mesial one was defined as an accessory mental foramen by an experienced anatomist (H. A.
