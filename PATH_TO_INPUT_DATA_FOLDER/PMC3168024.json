She had lost appetite and weight over the last two months. Examination revealed that her liver was enlarged three cm below the right subcostal margin. Her routine hematological analysis was as follows: hemoglobin - 10.6 g/dL, hematocrit - 32.5%, total leucocyte count - 15,300/mm3, differential leukocyte count - polymorphs: 60%, lymphocyte: 15%, eosinophil: 23%, monocyte: 2%. Ultrasonography of the upper abdomen showed a solitary hypoechoic lesion with irregular borders, 3.5 cm in diameter, suggestive of a hepatic abscess or neoplastic lesion. Fine needle aspiration was done from the lesion and the smears showed abundant, hexagonal, needle-shaped Charcot Leyden crystals in a background of degenerated hepatocytes, necrotic material, and mixed inflammatory infiltrate predominantly consisting of eosinophils. At places, poorly formed epithelioid cell granulomas were also seen [Figure and ] but Ziehl Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative. A possibility of helminthic infestation was considered and the patient was treated with anthelminthics. After a full course of antihelminthics, her routine hemogram was repeated and an excellent improvement was seen: total leucocyte count - 9,000/mm3, differential leucocyte count - polymorphs - 70%, lymphocyte - 20%, eosinophil - 8%, monocyte - 2%.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'10508877': 1, '11711784': 1, '9100774': 1, '11688468': 1, '11918332': 1, '11961153': 1, '16169299': 1, '14325469': 1, '28757755': 1, '11819630': 1, '34946267': 2, '8147371': 1, '21938158': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3168024-1': 2, '8705542-1': 1}"}
