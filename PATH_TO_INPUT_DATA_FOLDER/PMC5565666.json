Surgery was performed 2 days after the accident. Initial paresthesias of all fingertips disappeared after surgery. Postoperative CT scans showed an ideal position of the screws and a proper reduction (Fig. ). The patient complained minor bilateral dysesthesias in the dermatomes of C2 after surgery. 3 months later, the fracture was bony healed. There was no need of analgetic drugs anymore. Rotation was limited (20\u00b0 in both directions) and the chin-jugulum distance was 1 cm. A hardware removal was recommended to the patient but he continued medical treatment in his home country and was therefore lost for follow-up.\\nIn patient 1, a follow-up examination was performed 5 years after primary surgery. In standard X-ray we found a congruent and stable situation in both joints (Figs. , , ) and no complaints in upper cervical spine. The other two patients were lost for long-time follow-up.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11707712': 1, '24463337': 1, '3187689': 1, '21358480': 1, '32050311': 1, '2045393': 1, '3173661': 1, '5425648': 1, '23775293': 1, '20173529': 1, '28653130': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5565666-1': 2, '5565666-2': 2}"}
