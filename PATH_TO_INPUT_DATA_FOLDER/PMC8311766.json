On intraoral examination, the patient had a class 1 molar relationship with a missing maxillary left central incisor. A bulge could be felt in the palate in the anterior region (). A routine panoramic radiograph revealed an impacted incisor. The lateral cephalogram revealed a dilaceration in the incisor with the crown displaced palatally. The CBCT showed a palatally impacted dilacerated central incisor with root placed labially (). As the patient was in mixed dentition, a 2 \u00d7 4 appliance was planned. There was adequate space for the incisor therefore initial alignment followed by surgical exposure was planned. For the surgical protocol, an open surgical procedure was selected because the crown was covered only with palatal mucosa. A vertical loop was fabricated that was pushed back and ligated to the button to aid in the eruption of the tooth (). Once the crown was brought into the oral cavity with traction, a piggyback 0.012 NiTi wire on an 0.018 SS wire was placed. After the alignment of the tooth in the arch, root torque was given in a 17 \u00d7 25 TMA wire to bring the root in the proper position. The active treatment took 18 months. At the end of treatment, the upper incisor was well aligned ().", "age": "[[7.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18524273': 1, '17322650': 1, '5289628': 1, '30117639': 1, '16644419': 1, '11811233': 1, '29795486': 1, '16683671': 1, '11253297': 1, '15014404': 1, '10511669': 1, '23386930': 1, '19934236': 1, '10783451': 1, '34326602': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8311766-1': 2, '8311766-2': 2}"}
