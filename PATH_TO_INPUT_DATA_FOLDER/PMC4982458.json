The patient was not in acute distress, but appeared unwell and exhibited chills. There was no lymphadenopathy present. He denied any other systemic symptoms. A symmetrical, diffuse erythema was present with overlying scale covering >90 % of the body surface area. His skin was warm to the touch. There was no mucosal membrane involvement. The rash began in the groin and had since spread to the rest of the body. It was previously treated with several over-the-counter creams with no amelioration of symptoms. Silodosin had been started for prostatic enlargement 2 weeks before the rash began. In addition to silodosin, the patient was taking ramipril, cyclobenzaprine, atorvastatin, rabeprazole, levothyroxine, meloxicam, hydrocortisone valerate, an antihistamine of unknown name, ipratropium, and bacitracin/polymyxin (exact formulation of Polysporin\u00ae unknown). The patient was unable to provide the dosage of any of his medications. With the exception of silodosin, the patient did not report having recently started any of his other medications. Past medical, dermatologic, and family history was unremarkable. The patient quit smoking approximately 2 months prior.
