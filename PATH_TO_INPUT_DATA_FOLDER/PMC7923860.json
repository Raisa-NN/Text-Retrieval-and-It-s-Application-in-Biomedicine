The patient underwent CTA, which demonstrated an axillary artery occlusion with ground-glass opacification in the lungs. Clinically, the patient had no radial or brachial pulses in his right arm, and pallor, hypoesthesia, and coolness of the right arm were present. The patient had had no fever or respiratory symptoms but had had an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA test was positive. The patient underwent an emergency right upper extremity angiography, which demonstrated an acute axillary artery thrombosis (, A). The lesion was crossed with a spider filter (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) and treated with AngioJet (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Mass) mechanical thrombectomy. Repeat angiography demonstrated minimal residual thrombus, which was managed with a self-expanding stent (, B). No evidence of vascular compression at the thoracic outlet was noted during provocative maneuvers. The patient developed a palpable radial pulse with resolution of pain. The patient was given oral steroids and apixaban. He was discharged on the fourth postoperative day once he no longer required supplemental oxygen. At his 1-month follow-up examination, he had had continued arterial patency and no new thrombotic events.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25301841': 1, '32142651': 1, '30043540': 1, '32048163': 1, '32325026': 1, '32311448': 1, '32360679': 1, '29359665': 1, '19864379': 1, '33681541': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7923860-1': 2}"}
