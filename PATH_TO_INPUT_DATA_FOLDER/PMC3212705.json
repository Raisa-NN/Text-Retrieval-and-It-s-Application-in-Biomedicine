She had been healthy until she developed fever and cough 7 days prior to hospitalization. Two days after her initial symptoms, she was seen by a general practitioner and was started on oseltamivir based on a positive rapid antigen test result. However, her condition deteriorated and she experienced difficult breathing and sleepiness despite antiviral treatment. She was taken to a general hospital near her home and was eventually referred to our center due to impending respiratory failure and decreased mental status. She did not have any significant past medical or family history, and she had not been vaccinated against 2009 H1N1 influenza or seasonal influenza.\\nOn arrival, the patient's blood pressure was 117/67 mmHg, heart rate 181 beats/min, respiratory rate 40/min, and body temperature 37.5\u2103. Percutaneous oxygen saturation was 91% on 7 liters/min of oxygen via face mask. On physical examination, chest wall retraction was observed and left lung sounds were decreased. The patient did not have any abnormal focal neurological signs although she appeared drowsy. She was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and intubated immediately.\\nHer initial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.193, PaCO2 53.9 mmHg, PaO2 30.3 mmHg, bicarbonate 20.3 mmoL/L, and base excess -7.9 on 7 liters/min of oxygen via face mask. A complete blood count showed pancytopenia (white blood cell [WBC] count 710/\u00b5L, absolute neutrophil count 210/\u00b5L, hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL, platelets 81,000/\u00b5L) and her C-reactive protein was markedly elevated up to 37.18 mg/dL. Her immunoglobulin G level was decreased to 399 mg/dL. The patient was placed on high dose oseltamivir (60 mg/dose, body weight 13 kg) and intravenous immunoglobulin G was also given as 500 mg/kg/day for 2 days. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay in both a respiratory specimen and spinal fluid. Her initial chest radiograph showed diffuse haziness in the entire left lung field and the right upper lung field (). Thoracentesis was performed and 100 mL of turbid chocolate-colored fluid was drained from the left lung (pleural fluid analysis results: red blood cell >1,000/\u00b5L, WBC >1,000/\u00b5L, polymorphonuclear neutrophil 93%, pH 7.4, glucose 11 mg/dL, protein 3,564.6 mg/dL). A culture of the pleural fluid did not grow any organisms.\\nOn hospital day 3, a chest tube was inserted into the left pleural space due to increased pleural effusion causing tracheal deviation. On hospital day 6, chest computed tomography showed necrotizing pneumonia with a significant left pleural effusion (). She also had persistent high fever (39.1\u2103) and a striking leukocytosis (WBC count 24,250/\u00b5L, absolute neutrophil count 19,640/\u00b5L) despite broad spectrum antibiotics (cefotaxime and vancomycin). On hospital day 7, pneumothorax developed in the left lung () and the chest tube was replaced by one with a bigger sized lumen. As pneumothorax was waxed-and-waned on hospital day 8, more ventilator support (volume control mode, FiO2 1.0, positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] 5 cmH2O, TV 90 mL) was needed to maintain percutaneous oxygen saturation level near 90%. Peak inspiratory pressure was recorded at 23 to 34 cmH2O depending on the relief of pneumothorax. Due to her poor response to antibiotic treatment, cefotaxime was changed to meropenem. On hospital day 9, percutaneous oxygen saturation level was dropped to 77% due to progressive respiratory failure with a persistent purulent pleural effusion and a recurrent, massive pneumothorax (). To rescue the patient from progressing respiratory failure without raising positive airway pressure, which might aggravate pneumothorax, venovenous ECMO support was initiated.\\nOf note, multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii started to grow from both blood and tracheal aspirate cultures on hospital day 10. Follow-up cultures persistently grew A. baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia from both tracheal aspirates and pleural fluid. Blood cultures became negative 5 days after ECMO discontinuation (bacteremia persisted from day 10 to day 18). The tracheal aspirate cultures were positive from hospital days 10 to 34, and pleural fluid cultures were positive from hospital days 11 to 41. The total duration of ECMO support was 6 days, and successful weaning was achieved without cardiovascular complications. At the time of ventilator weaning, blood gas analysis showed pH 7.371, PaCO2 64.0 mmHg, PaO2 111.9 mmHg, bicarbonate 36.3 mmoL/L, and base excess 9.2 with conventional mechanical ventilation. Various combinations of antibiotics were used including isepamicin, minocyclin, rifampicin, ceftazidime, TMP-SMX, and colistin in an attempt to control persistent infections due to multidrug resistant A. baumannii and S. maltophilia. Total duration of oseltamivir medication was 23 days (high dose for 18 days and usual dose for 5 days).\\nThe patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation on hospital day 37, and all antimicrobials were discontinued on day 57. On day 63, the left chest tube was removed and she was discharged from the hospital alert and spontaneously breathing without difficulty in room air (). At the time this manuscript was submitted, the patient had no respiratory symptoms and a chest radiograph was markedly improved.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17370521': 1, '19630187': 1, '29124022': 1, '19822628': 1, '19815860': 1, '19822627': 1, '20082167': 1, '20040812': 1, '19762075': 1, '19887665': 1, '24574848': 1, '19798021': 1, '18158140': 1, '20022969': 1, '19462531': 1, '22087202': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
