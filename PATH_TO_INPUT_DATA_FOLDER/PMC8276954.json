The patient was born at 9 months by emergency cesarean section in view of meconium-stained liquor and fetal distress. He cried after 5\u201310min at birth after tactile stimulation. His birth weight was 3kg; after 24h of birth, he had recurrent episodes of seizures. The provisional diagnosis was kept as hypoxic ischemic injury. He was on antiepileptic drugs with good compliance. He had a significant developmental delay in all domains according to his appropriate age. At the age of 2 years, he again started having episodes of seizures and was managed accordingly by a pediatric neurologist. The developmental milestone delay continued as such. The frequency of seizures decreased significantly but would occur after every 6\u20138 months with good compliance. The last episode of seizure occurred at the age of 11 years. At the age of 11 years, he started to go to a special school for mentally retarded children. He had significant improvement in his behavior such as helping his mother with household chores, interacting with other children, playing games, counting the things, and emotional reactivity to external stimuli. This pattern continued till the age of 14 years. At the age of 14\u00bd years, antiepileptic drugs were stopped gradually over a period of 2\u20133 months and maintained well for the next 2 years. Reportedly, he was scolded by a school teacher for not following their commands. Following which, he stopped going to school, would appear fearful, and would keep on saying \u201cI will not go to school.\u201d If a family member asked about the school, he would become aggressive, say teachers are bad, and will harm him. After 4\u20135 days of the same, he became mute, staring at one place with a fixed gaze, and not responding to external stimuli. He would walk very slowly, would urinate in clothes, and would keep on sitting in spoilt clothes for hours together. Other than these symptoms, drooling of saliva, negativism, ambitendency, and posturing were also present. Injection lorazepam test dose carried out with 2mg had significant improvement. He was started on tablet lorazepam 6mg/day. Initially he showed response but later he did not show any response. In view of the same, he was admitted to the inpatient unit of the psychiatry ward of the hospital. On mental status examination, the patient was found to have staring, negativism, automatic obedience, posturing, rigidity, ambitendency, mutism, negativism, staring, and drooling of saliva. His Bush\u2013Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) score was 26. On investigation, hemogram, liver function test, renal function test, serum electrolyte levels, thyroid function test, ultrasound abdomen, X-ray chest (posterior-anterior view), and electrocardiogram did not reveal any abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain was suggestive of a reduction in the volume of the white matter with periventricular leucomalacia due to an old hypoxic insult. From clinical history and mental status examination, a diagnosis of mild mental retardation with catatonia was kept (epilepsy in the past). The dose of lorazepam was increased to 7mg thrice in a day. After giving a dose, he had significant improvement; BFCRS score came down from 26 to 6. Tablet olanzapine (5mg) was also started considering the fearfulness and odd behavior as psychotic symptoms, which occurred before the appearance of catatonic symptoms. The effect would last only for a few hours. He continued on tablet lorazepam 24mg/day in divided dose but did not show much improvement. It should also be noted that, despite this high lorazepam dose, he never became sedated or had any symptoms of respiratory suppression. Following this, he was considered for ECT.\\nHis parents were educated about the ECT procedure and the indications for the same in the patient. A written informed consent was obtained from his father as he was his guardian. An attempt was also made to take the patient\u2019s assent before initiating ECTs, but that could not be carried out considering his condition. He was then started on bilateral modified ECT.\\nAs his clinical condition improved, his assent was sought for subsequent ECTs. During this period, the patient did not have any subjective complaints or objective signs of memory impairment or post-ECT delirium or other complications. By his 12th ECT, his BFCRS score came down from 26 to 1, and following this, two more ECTs were given. After attainment of a plateau of clinical response, ECTs were stopped. On mental status examination, he had no active psychopathology at the end of the course of ECT. He was discharged after 1 week of observation. He was continued on tablet olanzapine 15mg/day after discharge. At home, he again started going to school, with adequate function as noted before the occurrence of the illness.", "age": "[[17.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24643578': 1, '8034819': 1, '11925520': 1, '11731724': 1, '10546967': 1, '12667158': 1, '24504828': 1, '24860225': 2, '12468999': 1, '10378153': 1, '11417928': 1, '34316310': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4031592-1': 1}"}
