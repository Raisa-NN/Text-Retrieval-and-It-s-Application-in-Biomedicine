She had undergone laparoscopic surgery for a benign ovarian cyst two years ago. She was evaluated and incidentally found to have a cystic lesion in the neck and proximal body of the pancreas. She had a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen which showed a heterogeneously enhancing lesion measuring approximately 3.8 x 3.1 cm with few cystic foci and peripheral calcifications arising from the body of pancreas. The pancreatic duct appeared normal, with no obvious communication with the same (Figure ). Based on imaging, she was suspected to have an MCN.\\nShe underwent an open central pancreatectomy (Figure ). The proximal stump of the pancreas was managed by suture closure reinforced with a falciform patch and the distal pancreatic stump was managed by PG by modified binding technique.\\nIn the postoperative period, she had chylous ascites (Clavien dindo Grade 1) managed with a high protein, low-fat diet, and diuretics and delayed gastric emptying (ISGPS Grade A) which was managed with prokinetic drugs. The length of the hospital stay was 10days. At one year follow-up, she did not develop glucose intolerance or symptoms of exocrine insufficiency. There was no recurrence of the tumor.", "age": "[[35.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23461663': 1, '20123332': 1, '26158172': 1, '23640664': 1, '26373586': 1, '25041506': 1, '29588609': 1, '29299757': 1, '19544497': 1, '19894223': 1, '19092337': 1, '22148126': 1, '31641855': 1, '28027816': 1, '29897920': 1, '31016226': 1, '16327486': 1, '29264427': 1, '22228052': 1, '34765372': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
