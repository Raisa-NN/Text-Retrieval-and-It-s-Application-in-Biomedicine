She was otherwise well, was not taking hormone medication, and had a body mass index of 24.4 kg/m2. A cervical smear revealed benign cellular changes. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an image typical of an endometrial cyst of the uterine cervix, with high intensity in T1W1 and T2W1, a smooth surface, and shading. Adenomyosis was observed in the body of the uterus, but there was no evidence of enlarged lymph nodes or ascites (). Her serum concentration of CA125 was 359 U/mL (normal <35 U/mL). At the time of laparotomy, she had an enlarged uterus (12\u00d77\u00d76 cm3), which weighed 231 g, and her uterine cervix was enlarged to the size of an egg, with multiple round masses. Severe adhesion was observed, with endometrial tissue in the posterior wall of the uterus and the peritoneum and total posterior cul-de-sac obliteration. The left ovary was adherent to the posterior surface of the uterus, with a dark brownish cyst typical of an endometrial cyst. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with adhesiolysis were performed, and the specimens were submitted for frozen section analysis. The extra-ovarian lesions were electrically cauterized. Pathologic examination of the frozen sections suggested an adenocarcinoma arising from endometriosis in the cervical wall.\\nOn gross examination, the cervical wall of the uterus contained a relatively well defined, cystic lesion filled with dark brown fluid, measuring 3\u00d72.2\u00d72.2 cm. The dark brown colored inner surface of the cyst showed multi-focal, papillary growing, solid and granular masses, measuring up to 0.8\u00d70.8\u00d70.5 cm (). Microscopically, these masses were composed of well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which was directly adjacent to the epithelium of the endometriotic cyst of the cervical wall. Transitional areas between the glandular epithelium of the endometriosis and the endometrioid adenocarcinoma cells were observed. There was no invasion to the cervical stroma and no connection between the overlying mucosal epithelium of the endo-ectocervix and the epithelium of the endometriosis or the adenocarcinoma. A secretory phase endometrium measured 0.8 cm in thickness. There was no evidence of a primary endometrial or endocervical adenocarcinoma in the endocervix or endometrium (). Multiple foci of endometriosis were present within the posterior wall of the uterus and both ovaries. A serous cystadenoma was also present in the right ovary, measuring 4.0 cm in greatest dimension.\\nThe expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors, p53 and c-erb B-2 was analyzed using paraffin immunohistochemistry. The area of endometrioid adenocarcinoma was positive for both estrogen and progesterone receptors. Weak expression of p53 and c-erbB2 (10-20% of nuclear staining) was observed in the carcinomatous area. The patient was diagnosed as having an endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from endometriosis of the uterine cervix. Following recovery from surgery, she was treated with six courses of chemotherapy, consisting of cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 every 4 weeks.\\nAt the present time, she has been clinically free of disease for 24 months since undergoing surgery.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'34680408': 1, '6832408': 1, '12144831': 1, '8631545': 1, '21814398': 1, '11093057': 1, '6859132': 1, '10507786': 1, '9077609': 1, '7418292': 1, '2010178': 1, '29851704': 1, '9099553': 1, '12911723': 1, '10757398': 1, '7835785': 1, '34540725': 2, '338141': 1, '6946672': 1, '5031251': 1, '12383550': 1, '12090586': 1, '12801273': 1, '2188180': 1, '3674158': 1, '3279356': 1, '19654969': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8432386-1': 1}"}
