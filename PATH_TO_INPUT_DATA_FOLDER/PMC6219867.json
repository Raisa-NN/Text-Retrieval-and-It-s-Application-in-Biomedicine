His medical history was negative for any cancer or chronic musculoskeletal complaints such as joint pain, weakness, or limited range of motion. Physical exam revealed no weakness, loss of range of motion, or numbness of the affected digits. A radiograph of the left hand demonstrated no fracture, dislocation, or foreign body. However, multiple small non-aggressive appearing periarticular sclerotic foci were visualized incidentally (Figure ).\\nFurther review of the patient\u2019s prior imaging studies revealed that similar appearing periarticular sclerotic foci were present in other areas as well, including the left knee (right not imaged), bilateral shoulders, hips and sacroiliac joints (Figures -). The radiographic findings coupled with the patient\u2019s medical history are compatible with the diagnosis of osteopoikilosis.", "age": "[[37.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22470634': 1, '21480185': 1, '15801069': 1, '17393171': 1, '17106662': 1, '21242270': 1, '1624505': 1, '22084176': 1, '30430046': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
