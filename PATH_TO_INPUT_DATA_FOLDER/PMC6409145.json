The previous surgery was done at 1 year before this procedure and the same surgeon of primary rhinoplasty has used this new device for correction of the irregularities. The cartilage resecting was done with a handy device which was named by us as \u201cclosed Nasal Chondrotome\u201d (). Local anesthesia was done by injection of xylocaine topical solution into the nose. The patient was alert during the whole procedure with no pain and no discomfort. The surgeon began to push the device toward the cartilaginous spur via an endonasal approach and lodge the semicircle edge of the instrument to the spur and tried to cut the bulge spur by introducing the obturator of the device across the dorsum of the nose. The surgeon could assess the shape of cartilage and the integrity of that via the touching of the dorsum by his/her second hand. This procedure took 10 minutes to be completely undertaken. The patient achieved satisfactory results ().", "age": "[[27.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'24290995': 1, '16557066': 1, '19944992': 1, '18547189': 1, '25255276': 1, '18951319': 1, '18505145': 1, '23783064': 1, '1732887': 1, '9656883': 1, '23277618': 1, '14362333': 1, '30873371': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
