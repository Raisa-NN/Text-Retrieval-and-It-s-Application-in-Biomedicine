She was born to non-consanguineous parents and had been under monitoring for delayed speech. On examination, her height and weight were 110 cm (10th to 25th percentile) and 23 kg (75th to 90th percentile), respectively. The dermatological examination was remarkable for hypopigmented patches following the Blaschko lines over the trunk and both legs, more prominently on the right leg (, ), which was thicker and longer (~2 cm) than the left (). Apart from these findings, the systemic examinations, routine haemogram and biochemical tests, and magnetic resonance scans of the cranium and lower extremities were normal. When the Denver Developmental Screening Test was administered for speech delay, it was graded as \u2018delayed\u2019, correlating with the age of 3.5 years. After consultation with the dermatology department, a skin biopsy was considered unnecessary.", "age": "[[5.5, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'1574469': 1, '26706010': 1, '11260527': 1, '2738798': 1, '10398257': 1, '21396561': 1, '26962770': 2, '11063076': 1, '32232208': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4998851-1': 1, '4998851-2': 1, '4998851-3': 1, '4998851-4': 1, '4998851-5': 1, '4998851-6': 1, '4998851-7': 1, '4998851-8': 1}"}
