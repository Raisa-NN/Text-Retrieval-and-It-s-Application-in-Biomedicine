She was diagnosed with angiosarcoma on biopsy. No distant metastases were identified on chest computed tomography (CT), brain magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT.\\nUnder general anesthesia, wide surgical excision was performed, including the pericranium, resulting in a near total defect of 25\u00d720 cm (). First, a FTSG was applied over the periorbital area and lower forehead area. Then, micro-burring of the cortical bone was performed followed by the application of Matriderm (Medskin Solution Dr Suwelack AG, Billerbeck, Germany) and afterward, STSG coverage was applied to the remaining defect (). The patient was discharged from the hospital in a tumor-free state 2 weeks postoperatively with no wound complications (). She received radiotherapy and was seen for follow-up in the outpatient department 13 months postoperatively, at which time she reported no other complications. Much to our regret, we lost her so that we could not follow upher wound after that time.", "age": "[[78.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23228143': 1, '25075353': 2, '23898439': 2, '17700115': 1, '10442304': 1, '26713314': 1, '33828637': 1, '24102765': 1, '26010102': 1, '24567771': 1, '22783510': 2, '28913291': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3385319-1': 1, '3385319-2': 1, '4113690-1': 1, '4113690-2': 1, '3724003-1': 1, '3724003-2': 1}"}
