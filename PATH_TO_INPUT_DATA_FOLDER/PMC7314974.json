Routine blood count showed lymphocytosis (white blood cell count: 40,000/mmc; platelets: 87,000/mmc; hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dl) with 80% lymphoid blasts in a peripheral blood smear. The subsequent bone marrow (BM) aspiration confirmed the diagnosis, showing the presence of aberrant cells with a B precursor immunophenotype (CD19+CD20\u2013CD10brightCD45dimCD34+CD58+CD5\u2013CD38low) () and expression of the BCR-ABL1 p210 fusion gene. Flow cytometric analysis of cerebrospinal fluid revealed no central nervous system involvement. On May 5, 2016, the patient started an induction treatment with Vincristine 2 mg weekly (4 administrations), methylprednisolone (60 mg/m2/day for 28 days) and dasatinib 140 mg daily (early switch from imatinib due to intolerance after the first 7 days of treatment), associated with the intrathecal administration of cytarabine and methylprednisolone as a prophylaxis, which resulted in a rapid hematological complete response and BM negative minimal residual disease (MRD) (10\u22124.2 in PCR, 10\u22124.5 in FCM) after 5 months (). On October 2016, the patient underwent an allo-SCT (4.6 \u00d7 106 CD34+ cells /Kg) from a HLA-matched relative (brother), after a myeloablative conditioning regimen that included busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) plus antithymoglobulin (ATG). As graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis the patient received cyclosporine and methotrexate. Grade 2 fever and grade 1 mucositis and diarrhea were the main acute toxicities observed during hospitalization. On February 2017, for the reappearance of BCR-ABL1 transcript (BCR-ABL/ABL ratio in peripheral blood: 0.079%), the patient stopped (progressively) cyclosporine treatment and re-started dasatinib. On day 200 after transplant the detected chimerism was 100%. MRD negativity was then maintained until February 2018, when the patient experienced a molecular relapse while staying in morphological CR (BCR-ABL/ABL ratio in peripheral blood: 0.025%). Of note, the patient was negative for the T315I mutation (conventional Sanger sequencing). The therapeutic decision, at this point, was to change the TKI, by switching to ponatinib (45 mg once a day), and to begin DLI (5 consecutive infusions until September 2018). The patient quickly achieved a complete molecular response (CMR) (MR4.5) but experienced signs of GVHD with the development of progressively expanding dyskeratosis and dry eye (confirmed with Schirmer test) for which begun a treatment with steroids and cyclosporin. Central nervous system evaluation through MNR and cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveal no signs of leukemic involvement. Interestingly, this clinical picture was accompanied by a substantial increase in normal B cell progenitors, an inversion between CD58+ and CD58\u2013 T/NK lymphocytes distribution () and by an inversion of the CD8/CD4 ratio () within the BM. At the last evaluation, done on December 2019, the patient is continuing therapy with ponatinib 45 mg once a day with reasonable tolerance and still maintains a MR4.5 (response maintained for 22+ months).", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28484463': 1, '18026156': 1, '28810255': 1, '25740105': 1, '27143254': 1, '27441651': 1, '21438838': 1, '31245042': 2, '22290066': 1, '18471874': 1, '18696183': 1, '29502175': 1, '30831480': 1, '28052371': 1, '19074114': 1, '31612105': 1, '22072555': 1, '17032921': 1, '28057668': 1, '12492591': 1, '32626658': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6554698-1': 1}"}
