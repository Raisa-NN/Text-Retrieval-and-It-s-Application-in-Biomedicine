The metabolic profile, including serum urea, creatinine and electrolyte all were within the normal range. Early morning cortisol level was well below normal level 2.2 \u03bcg/dl. Anti-HIV, anti hepatitis C virus hepatitis B surface antigen (HCV HBsAg) factors were negative. Mantoux tuberculin skin test was negative and chest radiograph also ruled out tuberculosis.
