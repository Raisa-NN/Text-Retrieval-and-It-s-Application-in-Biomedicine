Right hemiglossectomy was performed by the ENT team and subsequent defects were reconstructed using the bilobed LAFF (). The bilobed LAFF was designed to be about 8\u00d74.5 cm. Upper lobe is for the mouth floor defect and lower lobe for the tongue tip. Posterior radial collateral artery and its vena comitans are used as the pedicle (). The flap pedicle was anastomosed to the superior thyroidal artery and external jugular vein. Neurorrhaphy was not performed. Postoperatively, a thin LAFF was observed on the hemiglossectomy defect (). The flap survived without complications (). At the last follow-up, 5 months postoperatively, the patient reported no difficulty in tasting and swallowing, and reported some difficulty in pronouncing. In this patient, neurorrhaphy was not performed, but the difficulty in tasting was less seem to the fact that the hemiglossectomy defect was smaller than the other cases.", "age": "[[24.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28205260': 1, '8680967': 1, '25417603': 1, '19536773': 1, '17633154': 1, '33425574': 1, '7646864': 1, '23184439': 1, '27064226': 1, '24289234': 1, '17620891': 1, '17262158': 1, '14962084': 1, '23357991': 1, '34805255': 2, '15459922': 1, '21124135': 1, '25634781': 1, '26044397': 1, '15577337': 1, '7094520': 1, '16859912': 1, '26044088': 1, '3725941': 1, '18794446': 1, '25046679': 1, '20135979': 1, '18415928': 1, '10958417': 1, '30840817': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6411518-1': 2, '8599122-1': 1}"}
