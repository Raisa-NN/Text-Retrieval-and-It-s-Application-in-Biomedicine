She confirmed the level of pain on five according to VAS. Patient localised the pain in the lower back, posterior-lateral thigh and calf. She received pain killers and anti-inflammation drugs from her GP. She was diagnosed by university neurologist with sciatica-like symptoms on the basis of bedside examinations and NSE (a norm for every component of the test was confirmed). Leftward disc herniation at the L5-S1 with left nerve root intracanal compression were the only abnormalities registered in MRI. In electroneurography, no dysfunction of peripheral conduction of lower limb nerves was discovered. However, by means of electromyography, features of motor unit dysfunction in L4-L5 innervation were recorded on the left side during maximal contraction. Laboratory tests confirmed neutropenia (NEUT#1.93\u00d710\u00b53/ \u00b5L; NEUT% 33.6%), slight monocytosis (MO# 0.83\u00d710\u00b53/ \u00b5L; MO% 14.3%); elevated levels of lymphocytes 49.8%; and trombocytosis 863\u00d710\u00b53/ \u00b5L. Other results were normal - ECR 8/lh, CRP 5.3 mg/l.", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'34356127': 1, '23662122': 1, '1848966': 1, '12015843': 1, '25888420': 1, '12827364': 1, '19672170': 1, '9009734': 1, '2312537': 1, '19163983': 1, '26180796': 1, '18047882': 1, '19210492': 1, '8235865': 1, '23115475': 1, '10739894': 1, '19457278': 1, '1826376': 1, '26137486': 1, '22430655': 1, '18206282': 1, '8208267': 1, '17704089': 1, '19236988': 1, '25821479': 1, '10851096': 1, '25201416': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4171577-1': 2, '4171577-2': 2}"}
