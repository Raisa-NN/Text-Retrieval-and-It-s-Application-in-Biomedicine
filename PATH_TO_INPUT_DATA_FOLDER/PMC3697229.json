The patient had experienced some pain and asymmetry on his left side. Physical examination revealed an interincisal opening of 10 mm () and left zygomatic arch expansion (). A panoramic radiograph showed that the left coronoid process was slightly elongated when compared with the contralateral side. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed well-corticated exophytic protuberance projecting anteriorly and superiorly from the hypertrophied left coronoid process (). The patient was then scheduled for left coronoidectomy and excision of the exophytic mass (osteochondroma).", "age": "[[27.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21411289': 1, '12022113': 1, '17486187': 1, '8488021': 1, '25664314': 2, '3473353': 1, '20046487': 1, '6588171': 1, '9882999': 1, '30680307': 2, '16421267': 1, '15876963': 1, '6592504': 1, '267760': 1, '12420273': 1, '10670605': 1, '31452728': 1, '23844306': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4317525-1': 1, '6338684-1': 1}"}
