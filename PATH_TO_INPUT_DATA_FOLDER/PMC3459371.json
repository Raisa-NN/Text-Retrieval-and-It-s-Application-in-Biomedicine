He complained of four-month progressive fatigue, and pain and weakness of his legs for about one week. He had been taking diclofenac (a NSAID) for the pain but without relief. He presented neither fever nor other symptoms (weight loss, night sweats). On examination, spastic paraparesis was confirmed with a sensitive level at the eight thoracic medullar (T8) segment. He was slightly pale and had a gingival hemorrhage, ecchymosis of the left thigh and hepatomegaly. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a posterolateral extradural mass from T6 through T8 segments with medullar compression (). A complete blood count showed anemia (hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (12 x 109/L) and white blood count of 7.5 x 109/L (with 4.8 and 1.3 absolute promyelocyte and blast counts, respectively). Fibrinogen was below normal limits (1.04 g/L: normal range: 1.8-3.0 g/L), the international normalized ratio was 1.86 (normal range: 0.8-1.2) and the partial thromboplastin time was within normal limits. Electrolytes and the hepatic and renal functions were within the normal range. Uric acid (588 \u00b5mol/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (712 UI/L: normal \u2264 610 UI/L) were both elevated. A bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellularity with a massive infiltration of promyelocytes (with palisades of Auer rods) compatible with the diagnosis of APL. Qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the PML-RAR\u03b1 gene was positive and a cytogenetic examination identified a t(15;17)(q22q21) abnormality.\\nATRA therapy (45mg/m2/day) combined with daunorubicin (60 mg/m2) on days 2, 4, 6 and 8 was initiated. The patient evolved with ATRA syndrome that was controlled with dexamethasone, and febrile neutropenia, treated with ceftazidime and amikacin. Despite chemotherapy and ATRA, the patient presented deterioration in the weakness of his legs and lost bladder sphincter control. Radiotherapy for the extradural lesion (total dose of 3000 cGy) was attempted but no clear clinical improvement was noticed. Nephrotic syndrome was noted, probably due to treatment with ATRA, which was interrupted. The patient evolved with hematological remission of APL but persistence of the extradural mass. Soon after hematological remission was achieved, he presented with respiratory distress that evolved to hypotension and shock. Pneumonia was diagnosed which was treated with vancomycin and imipenem. Despite intensive care with ventilation support, the patient died of sepsis without any recovery from his neurologic deficit.", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30847197': 2, '18812465': 1, '19340529': 1, '18664623': 1, '26031537': 1, '9781945': 1, '34368322': 2, '17437290': 1, '2591162': 1, '19074116': 1, '10221502': 1, '16307026': 1, '8952559': 1, '23049367': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6389481-1': 1, '8316963-1': 1}"}
