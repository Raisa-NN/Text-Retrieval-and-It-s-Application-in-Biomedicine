He also referred recent new-onset headache and hypoaesthesia of the scalp.\\nSince a minimal diastolic murmur was occasionally discovered, the patient underwent to a transthoracic echocardiography one year before that documented a moderate aortic regurgitation.\\nOn admission, the patient was in normal mental and haemodynamic state. The physical examination revealed only a mild aortic diastolic murmur. Temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, and routine blood tests showed CRP 101.6 mg/L, ESR 70 mm/hour, creatinine 1.42 mg/dL, fibrinogen 438 mg/dL, and hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL. Chest X-ray and ECG were normal. The patient indicated Levofloxacin treatment in the previous week.\\nDuring the hospital stay, blood tests for autoimmunity (ESR, ANA, ANCA, ASOT), wrist and hip X-rays, PPD skin test, and blood cultures were performed and all resulted negative. However, patient continued to complain of episodes of evening fever (peak temperature 37.5\u00b0C) despite a progressive reduction of the swelling in the right knee.\\nThe rheumatologic consultation suggested a possible giant-cell arteritis; thus, the patient underwent temporal artery biopsy of the, which was negative, and steroid therapy was started (prednisone 0.6 mg/kg).\\nIn the following days, the patient showed a slight benefit in the articular pain but developed an episode of amaurosis fugax. Considering the amaurosis secondary to refractory giant-cell arteritis, steroid dosage was increased, and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin was started.\\nOne week following admission, the patient was found lying in bed, frankly stuporous, with a stable haemodynamic state and with no ischemic sign on the ECG. The neurological consultation documented a right hemiplegia syndrome. A cerebral CT scan was performed and no signs of intracranial mass or hemorrhage were shown, implying that the hemiplegia syndrome was of ischemic origin. In fact, the CT scan at 24 hours demonstrated a hypodense lesion of ischemic nature in the left parieto-occipital area at the grey-white junction, with no hemorrhagic component.\\nThe day after, blood tests showed an increase in leukocyte count with neutrophilia that was considered secondary to steroid therapy; consequently the antibiotic therapy initially started was promptly stopped. Two days after, the patient indicated a typical dull thoracic pain, which radiated to the left arm. The ECG showed a lateral ST segment elevation. Due to the recent ischemic stroke, the patient underwent an urgent cerebral CT scan in order to rule out a possible hemorrhagic evolution of the stroke as this might have been a contraindication to an aggressive antiplatelet therapy. Once hemorrhage was excluded, the patient underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with a loading dose of 600 mg of Clopidogrel and the administration of GP IIb/IIIa blockers during the procedure. The coronary angiography showed a complete occlusion of the very distal tract of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), while the remaining coronary arteries were completely free from any stenosis/atherosclerotic lesion. The interventionist only performed thromboaspiration of the thrombotic occlusion, without stent implantation.\\nIn consideration of all the ischemic events, a possible relationship among all of them seemed reasonable. Since the embolization of vegetations from an IE could have explained acute myocardial infarction (AMI), amaurosis fugax and stroke, the filter containing the material obtained by means of thromboaspiration was sent to the bacteriology lab to be cultured in spite of preceding negative blood cultures. In the meantime, in order to confirm the suspicion of IE, a transesophageal echocardiography (TE) was performed, and three sets of peripheral blood cultures were taken again. Echocardiography showed, during diastole, the presence of a small dense formation of approximately 1 mm in diameter on the aortic valve, close to a moderate aortic regurgitation.\\nAfter two days, the thrombotic material showed growth of S. aureus, while just one out of three blood cultures resulted positive for S. epidermidis, clearly due to contamination. Steroid therapy was immediately stopped and a specific therapy with Vancomycin and Rifampicin was started, as suggested by the antibiogram.", "age": "[[69.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'2202311': 1, '21986489': 1, '19713420': 1, '20850034': 1, '22922416': 1, '18539223': 1, '23533433': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
