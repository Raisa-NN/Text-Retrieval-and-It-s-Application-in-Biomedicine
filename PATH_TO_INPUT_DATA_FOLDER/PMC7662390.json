The clinical course was initially favorable under inhaled iloprost monotherapy sequentially combined with bosentan and, later, sildenafil due to hemodynamic deterioration. Despite the triple therapy the clinical and hemodynamic response was unsatisfactory. The iloprost treatment was successfully changed from inhaled to IV route delivered by a central venous catheter. Following that time the patient developed numerous catheter-related infections requiring hospitalizations and central line replacements. In order to reduce the risk of infection an implantable pump (LenusPro\u00ae 40 ml) was fitted.\\nAs with the first case we observed a progressive increase in treprostinil flow reaching 1.52 ml/day which is a 20% increase over the calibrated value of 1.27 ml/day (\u00b1 10%) (). The drug dilution was adjusted at each refill procedure in order to counterbalance the increased flow rate and maintain a stability of treatment at 35\u201341 ng/kg/min without any adverse event or side effect related to the treatment. Despite these measures, further hemodynamic evaluation concluded that the PAH was worsening under maximal treatment. The patient was referred for a lung transplant but died suddenly whilst still on the waiting list.", "age": "[[22.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20022264': 1, '29944075': 2, '20430649': 1, '30293617': 1, '23307827': 1, '27670656': 1, '30545971': 1, '11897647': 1, '28429083': 1, '29195500': 1, '31723407': 1, '27396777': 1, '32206306': 1, '33195292': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7662390-1': 2, '6295941-1': 1}"}
