He presented with acute renal failure linked to severe dehydration secondary to diarrhea that had lasted a week. He was known to have end-stage renal disease secondary to nephrotoxicity from calcineurin inhibitors administered over 15 years as part of his heart transplant anti-graft rejection regimen, but had not started hemodialysis yet. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) calculation, was 16.8 mL/minute/1.73 m2 before admission, and he had only mild proteinuria (0.56 g/24 hours) and no hematuria.\\nOn admission, his clinical and specifically his abdominal examinations were unremarkable except for the presence of non-hemorrhagic and non-mucoid diarrhea associated with fever. Community-acquired infectious gastroenteritis was suspected. Our patient's medical history revealed he had been diagnosed as having a transposition of the great arteries that led to an initially successful heart transplantation 15 years ago, before the occurrence of chronic cardiac transplant rejection. As a former smoker, he had also had an isolated ischemic stroke five years ago, but had no history of allergies or anaphylaxis. A recent echocardiograph showed congestive heart failure, with, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% and pulmonary hypertension. His immunosuppressive regimen included cyclosporin (45 mg twice a day) and prednisone (5 mg/day). He was given intravenous antibiotic therapy including ceftriaxone (1 g/day) and oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg/day).\\nBecause he presented with symptoms of heart failure following rehydration, as well as no improvement of his renal function, intermittent hemodialysis was started on day five after admission after the placement of a temporary jugular catheter. By day nine, because of persistent sepsis and diarrhea despite the antibiotic therapy, an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and our patient was diagnosed as having stercoral peritonitis secondary to a colonic diverticular perforation. Bacteroides fragilis was identified in blood cultures. A Hartmann surgical procedure was performed and the antibiotic therapy was switched to piperacillin/tazobactam (4 g twice a day) (Figure ).\\nBy day 24 after admission, our patient showed clinical improvement. He had no further fever or diarrhea, and his biological test results had normalized, so piperacillin/tazobactam was stopped. On day 27, his fever recurred. A second abdominal CT scan showed an abdominal peri-hepatic abscess, and antibiotic therapy was restarted (piperacillin/tazobactam (4 g twice a day), gentamycin (a single injection), and vancomycin (one injection at each hemodialysis session). By day 36, our patient became afebrile and a third CT scan showed regression of the peri-hepatic fluid collection. Antibiotic therapy was again stopped on day 41, after a second 15-day course.\\nOn the day the antibiotic therapy should have been stopped, our patient had necrotic purpura eruptions on the external sides of his feet, knees, and elbows (Figure ). Concomitant with the purpuric eruptions, he also presented with arthralgia and macroscopic hematuria, but remained afebrile. Arthralgia was bilateral, and located in the joints near the purpuric eruptions. Hematuria was asymptomatic, and was associated to either other urinary signs, or intra-vesical clotting. This new flare was accompanied by systemic inflammatory response syndrome and elevated C-reactive protein level (124 mg/L; normal values < 3 mg/L), and a new empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated, including intravenous gentamycin, ceftriaxone, and valaciclovir. Vancomycin was continued. An echocardiograph showed no signs of endocarditis. Blood cultures, urine analysis, as well as polymerase chain reaction testing for herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), HSV2, and varicella zoster virus (VZV), and serology for HSV1, HSV2, VZV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), parvovirus B19, rickettsia, and Lyme disease, did not show any evidence of recent viral, bacterial, or fungal infections. Differential diagnostic investigations included tests for anti-nuclear antibodies, cryoglobulin, cryofibrinogen, complement dosage, protein electrophoresis, immunoglobulin dosage; results were positive for isolated anti-nuclear antibody (1/200, with no specificity), and increased circulating polyclonal IgA level (4.71 g/L; normal values: 0.88 to 4.1 g/L). Skin biopsies, performed four days after the eruptions, showed leucocytoclastic necrotic vasculitis of the dermal capillaries (Figure ), with neutrophils and lymphocytes in and around the blood vessels and intra-vascular fibrin thrombi, all of which are characteristic features of vasculitis. Immunofluorescence examination showed IgM and C3 deposits in the dermal capillary walls.\\nOn day 53 after admission, that is, 12 days after the first eruption occurred and after antibiotic therapy was restarted, our patient presented with arthritis of the right knee and left elbow. Arthritis regressed spontaneously within 48 hours, and no articular puncture was performed.\\nOn day 58 after admission, he then presented with a second purpuric eruption of both legs, associated with arthralgia and macroscopic hematuria. All bacteriological and viral test results were negative and he was still receiving antibiotics at that time, so that antibacterial therapy was interrupted. A full-body CT scan showed no more abscess and no adenopathy, but ascitis, which on puncture produced a sterile fluid. A second skin biopsy was performed on the day the purpura appeared. It showed the same leucocytoclastic dermal vasculitis with eosinophils, but vascular IgA and C3 deposits were found with immunofluorescence imaging (Figure ).\\nAfter antibiotic therapy was stopped, our patient finally recovered entirely with disappearance of purpura, arthritis and hematuria, and has not relapsed after a follow-up period of eight months.", "age": "[[42.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30147875': 2, '3670205': 1, '20413568': 1, '27316345': 1, '2937155': 1, '20427206': 1, '28637844': 1, '9645421': 1, '20933302': 1, '4002188': 1, '19558258': 1, '11795675': 1, '9733391': 1, '22490390': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6099028-1': 1}"}
