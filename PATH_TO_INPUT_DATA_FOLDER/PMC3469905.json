The clinical appearance was similar to mesenchymal tumors, salivary gland tumors, or even bone tumor with soft tissue invasion. An omnipaque contrast CT scan was taken, in which a well-circumscribed lesion with a density similar to adipose tissue was shown [].\\nWith a provisional diagnosis of oral lipoma under local anesthesia, surgical excision of the lesion was performed. When a deep seated, yellow, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass with a lobulated surface 4 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 1.2 (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 thickness) centimeters in size was totally excised and submitted for microscopic examination in 10% buffered formalin [Figures and ].\\nIn pathology laboratory, the submitted specimen was processed and embedded in paraffin using standard procedures. From the paraffin block a 3 \u03bc section was prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin stain (H and E) to allow histopathologic examination.\\nIn microscopic examination of H and E stained slides, using light microscope (Olympus, Japan), a well-circumscribed nodular mass was seen. Which showed a distinct lobular pattern composed of mature adipocytes, cells with large clear cytoplasm and a flat dark nucleus on periphery. Thin septa of fibrous tissue was seen between the closely packed normal looking fat cells. At the borders, lesion was surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule. According to histopathologic features a definitive diagnosis of lipoma was made []. In an 18-month postsurgery follow-up no recurrence or complication has occurred.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20383107': 1, '27489068': 1, '19830025': 2, '21448446': 1, '23814589': 2, '25815220': 2, '24551744': 1, '19159027': 1, '29354591': 1, '28300904': 2, '27957277': 1, '15472660': 1, '23087744': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3692179-1': 1, '5325003-1': 1, '3302006-1': 1, '4359822-1': 1}"}
