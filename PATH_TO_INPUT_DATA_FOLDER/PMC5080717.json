Colonoscopy showed a circumferential tumor in the ascending colon (Fig. ). Abdominal CT scans revealed an ascending colon tumor, and its boundary against the adjacent small bowel was unclear (Fig. ). Right hemicolectomy, partial resection of the jejunum and partial abdominal wall resection were performed. Pathological examination revealed that the 9-cm tumor in the ascending colon invaded directly into the jejunum. Two lymph nodes were positive for metastasis in the mesenterium of the small intestine. Recurrent lesions were found in the liver 67 months after the operation.
