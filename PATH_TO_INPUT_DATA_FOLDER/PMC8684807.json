He had previously undergone surgery for appendicitis and had on other past medical history. He exhibited mild intellectual disability, and electrocardiography (ECG) depicted a short PR interval with pre-excitation and negative T waves (). Echocardiography revealed a hypertrophic dilated left ventricle with poor systolic function [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 24%] and signs suggestive of non-compaction myocardium (). Doppler parameters indicated reduced e\u2032 velocity at the mitral valve annulus and increased tricuspid regurgitation velocity. A restrictive filling pattern was evident via pulse Doppler of the mitral valve. According to the American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging guidelines and references, his left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was in Grade 3. There was severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Abnormal laboratory parameters included elevated total bilirubin (85.3 \u00b5mol/L), indirect bilirubin (55.4 \u00b5mol/L), and aspartate aminotransferase (284 IU/L). He experienced sudden cardiac death at the age of 33 years.", "age": "[[31.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12084876': 1, '32499120': 1, '18413590': 1, '10972294': 1, '20439808': 1, '31410105': 1, '27037982': 1, '31240821': 1, '27742774': 1, '25228319': 1, '28874292': 1, '21415759': 1, '19318653': 1, '22187509': 1, '30857840': 1, '34934899': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
