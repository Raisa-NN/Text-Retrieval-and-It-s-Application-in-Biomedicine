He was known diabetic and hypertensive on treatment since four years. The BCVA in right and left eyes were 20/200 and 20/80, respectively. Fundus evaluation showed foveal thinning in the right eye and RPE alterations over fovea in the left eye []. On EDI OCT, the left eye [] showed subretinal fluid with double-layer sign and parafoveal intraretinal schitic spaces, the left eye showed foveal thinning. SFCT measured in right and left eye were 0.22 and 0.41 mm, respectively. FAF [] in left eye shows areas of mixed autofluorescence over the macula. FFA in left eye showed a small leak just adjacent to fovea and multiple other window defects; ICG showed dilated choroidal vessels in the early phase []. In view of these findings, a diagnosis of PNV was made and reduced fluence PDT followed by injection anti-VEGF was advised for the left eye. Two months later, the BCVA in left eye was 20/25 with significant symptomatically improvement. The EDI OCT [Fig. and ] showed dry macula with SFCT reduced from 0.41 to 0.28 mm. At eight months post op, the vision was maintained and the EDI OCT was dry.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27597633': 1, '29411171': 1, '33755678': 1, '30002400': 1, '25158945': 1, '23751942': 1, '32729062': 1, '28114590': 1, '18639219': 1, '26542071': 1, '29899646': 1, '29490349': 1, '25046398': 1, '27115853': 1, '29995841': 1, '25494246': 1, '26451092': 1, '31546507': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6786171-1': 2, '6786171-2': 2, '6786171-3': 2, '6786171-4': 2, '6786171-5': 2}"}
