LogMAR in his right eye was 0.22, and OCT revealed one disc diameter sized shallow subretinal fluid and thick choroid with inner choroidal attenuation. FA showed a diffuse leakage and ICGA showed dilated choroidal vessels and choroidal vascular hyperpermeability. Half dose PDT (spot size = 5400 \u03bcm) was effective. The mean choroidal volume before treatment, one month after treatment, and three months after treatment was 2.46, 1.85, and 2.00 mm3 for the central area, 1.47, 1.41, and 1.40 mm3 for the superior nasal area, 1.61, 1.48, and 1.48 mm3 for the superior temporal area, 1.12, 1.08, and 1.08 mm3 for the inferior nasal area, 1.28, 1.19, and 1.21 mm3 for the inferior temporal area. Visual acuity did not improve because of retinal outer layer atrophy ().", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12271373': 1, '26868048': 1, '27410354': 1, '23095766': 1, '7029798': 1, '15019327': 1, '32011585': 1, '12049594': 1, '31319157': 1, '21556938': 1, '24487046': 1, '14660450': 1, '30897068': 1, '14707823': 1, '25932547': 1, '23208313': 1, '22840480': 1, '28161920': 1, '16604394': 1, '25079820': 1, '25616728': 1, '11867605': 1, '15126146': 1, '32651158': 1, '20162298': 1, '27668634': 1, '32033714': 1, '22580107': 1, '22921388': 1, '32251239': 1, '27849311': 1, '29776672': 1, '32847076': 1, '33654666': 1, '33109938': 1, '25595669': 1, '34832922': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8621234-1': 2}"}
