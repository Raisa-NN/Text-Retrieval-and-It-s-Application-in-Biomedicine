BCVA was 1.2. Fluorescein angiography displayed occult with no classic choroidal neovascularization, and indocyanine green angiography showed no polypoidal lesion. After three monthly IVR injections, an RPE tear developed. Nine monthly additional IVR injections over 21 months failed to improve the persistent exudative change and BCVA was reduced to 0.2. We switched the anti-VEGF agent from ranibizumab to aflibercept. The persistent exudative change resolved completely after one injection and there was no recurrence over 6 months. BCVA was 0.2 at the last visit.", "age": "[[78.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12177445': 1, '19516114': 1, '23664153': 1, '22813448': 1, '22350060': 1, '22302382': 1, '18930553': 1, '22408217': 1, '23558214': 1, '18356264': 1, '23945637': 1, '33346626': 1, '17318562': 1, '17558314': 1, '21872935': 1, '23549101': 1, '19308441': 1, '19752583': 1, '25028532': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4077850-1': 2, '4077850-2': 2}"}
