The ball had hit to the tip of his finger while he tried to get the ball away from his goal post.\\nOn physical examination, the finger was markedly deformed with swelling and difficulty on moving the finger. Neurovascular examination was normal. Initial plain radiographs demonstrated a dorsal dislocation of both the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints (). Without the use of local anesthesia, reduction of both the dislocations was easily achieved, by longitudinal traction and pressure on the dorsal aspect of the distal phalanx. Plain radiographs confirmed successful reduction without any bony avulsion fracture (). Both joints were stable, and the index finger was immobilized with the middle finger for two weeks.\\nAt 3 weeks of follow-up, the flexion of the DIP and PIP joints was 45\u00b0 and 75\u00b0, respectively, while extension was normal in both joints. At 6 weeks of follow-up, the patient had almost full painless active range of motion. 5 months after reduction, he returned to previous level of sports activities.", "age": "[[16.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11500690': 1, '32595120': 1, '26837941': 1, '25279043': 1, '25983481': 1, '15055322': 1, '19219443': 1, '25995796': 2, '10853916': 1, '17414369': 1, '33791135': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7984901-1': 2, '4430159-1': 1, '4430159-2': 1}"}
