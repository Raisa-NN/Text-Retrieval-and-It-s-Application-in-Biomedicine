The pain was fluctuating in severity, did not correlate with specific activities, and was only partially relieved with common analgesics. The patient's work involved prolonged standing and heavy lifting. He had had bilateral pes planus and valgus heels during his childhood but had been asymptomatic for several years. Two abdominal nodules had been excised by a dermatologist two years prior to the onset of his presenting complaint. The histopathology report confirmed they were a fibroma and a leiomyoma of no particular clinical significance. Apart from a few other minor injuries, his past medical and surgical history was otherwise unremarkable.\\nThe pain was attributed to the patient's previous pes planus deformity and was treated conservatively with common analgesia by the GP. Over the next three months the pain did not resolve and the patient was referred to the local orthopedics outpatient clinic. Extensive X-ray studies and blood tests including inflammatory and immunological markers were all normal, and the patient was referred to Orthotics for foot arch support.\\nDespite the arch support, the pain progressively worsened over the next 6 months. A foot MRI revealed mild, early degenerative 1st MTP joint changes with a small amount of fusion, but no other abnormalities. The diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy was also considered and supported by the findings of a radionuclide isotope scan. Although rocker soles and stronger analgesia (including oral morphine) were suggested, these failed to control the symptoms. Although this was followed by physiotherapy and multiple guanethidine blocks, symptoms remained uncontrolled and caused significant disability 18 months after the patient's first GP visit.\\nIn the following weeks the patient developed progressive weight loss, fatigue, and muscle wasting below the knee. He noticed for the first time a firm round mass (approximately 15 cm) on the lower aspect of the posterior thigh. He was referred back to Orthopaedics and an urgent MRI confirmed an oval, smoothly defined heterogenous mass in addition to signal changes in both right and left femurs, most likely representing metastatic foci ().\\nThe appearances were most suggestive of metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST), and the patient was urgently referred to Oncology. Chest CT and whole-body MRI revealed the presence of multiple lung and bone metastases, consistent with stage IVb malignant disease. Predisposing factors for this rare malignancy including NF-1 were considered. A detailed clinical examination revealed freckling of the right axillary region. In addition, the histology slides from the patient's abdominal skin nodule biopsy were reexamined by a specialist. The initial fibroma diagnosis was inconsistent with histopathological findings, which were more in keeping with an intraneural neurofibroma, part of a plexiform neurofibroma.\\nBased on the National Institute of Health (NIH) diagnostic criteria, the patient was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type I []. The patient was started on palliative chemotherapy with doxorubicin, but unfortunately died 4 months later, almost 24 months from his initial complaint.", "age": "[[24.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17105749': 1, '20027112': 1, '18286466': 1, '19117870': 1, '19835664': 1, '3128965': 1, '19410195': 1, '19348714': 1, '22312371': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
