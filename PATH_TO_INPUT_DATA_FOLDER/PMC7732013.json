On physical examination, the baby was hemodynamically stable. The abdomen was distended with palpable lump in the lower abdomen. Perineum examination revealed meconuria, small perineum, and absent anal opening. A preliminary diagnosis of persistent cloaca was made.\\nLaboratory investigations reveal physiological jaundice (total bilirubin 5.76 mg/dl) and normal qualitative CRP; abdominal radiographs suggested CPC. After preoperative optimization, laparotomy was performed with left hockey stick incision which revealed double pouch, i.e., segmental dilatation of the terminal ileum (ileal pouch) with CPC type 2 as per SM classification []. The vascular supply of the pouch colon was from abnormal arborizing vessels arising from the superior mesenteric vessels. There was duplication of the Mullerian structures along with hydrometrocolpos (both uteri); both the fallopian tubes were dilated and inflamed [].\\nThe fistula from the distal pouch was divided and ligated. Learning from the previous experience, both the pouches were resected and end ileostomy was performed. Tube vaginostomy was performed to decompress the hydrometrocolpos. Postoperatively stoma started functioning and the patient tolerated the feeds well. The histopathological examination of the specimen confirmed CPC. The outcome was favorable; the patient is waiting for definitive surgery.", "age": "[[1.0, 'day']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'31571761': 2, '18278506': 1, '27896163': 2, '12194131': 1, '8201516': 1, '33343116': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7732013-1': 2, '5117278-1': 1, '6752078-1': 1}"}
