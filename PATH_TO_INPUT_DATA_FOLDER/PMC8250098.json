The patient had a BMI of 24.9 kg/m2 and grade III ptosis (). The initial volume of the left breast was 510 mL. We planned NSM using a vertical pattern reduction in combination with immediate pedicled extended LD flap reconstruction plus textured anatomic implant (Mentor CPG 321, 280 cc). To reduce mastectomy flap necrosis, the oncologic surgeon preserved the maximum possible amount of subcutaneous fat and medial perforators while performing tumor excision (). The weight of the excised breast tissue was 480 g. For symmetry, vertical reduction of the contralateral breast was also performed. Satisfactory result was achieved at 5 years after surgery ().", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19050512': 1, '28319433': 1, '21738086': 1, '16850148': 1, '25839173': 1, '28328638': 1, '24867749': 1, '16557061': 1, '14520058': 1, '32653836': 1, '20134317': 1, '17112698': 1, '26111328': 1, '22056645': 1, '25289296': 1, '14578787': 1, '11000574': 1, '20539977': 1, '26430632': 1, '19483564': 1, '28458968': 1, '34128364': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8250098-1': 2, '8250098-2': 2}"}
