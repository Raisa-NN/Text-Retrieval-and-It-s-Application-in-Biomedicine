Cranial CT scan showed mild subarachnoid hemorrhage without definite significance. On admission, his glucose and serum electrolyte levels were normal. Three days later, he developed partial seizures that began in his face. The average duration of the seizures in each episode was 4 min (range: 1\u20135 min, with one seizure lasting for 10 min) and could not be controlled by antiepileptic drugs. At the same time, his average plasma glucose level was 18.32 mmol/L (range: 15\u201324 mmol/L, normal range: 3.9\u20136.1 mmol/L), and his serum electrolyte levels were normal. When the seizures stopped, his average plasma glucose level decreased to 8.3 mmol/L (range: 4.7\u201311.2 mmol/L, normal range: 3.9\u20136.1 mmol/L). He had no family history of epilepsy and denied a history of spontaneous seizures or hyperglycemia. Under the guidance of an endocrinologist, the patient's hyperglycemia was treated with intravenous fluids and insulin and the seizures resolved. He was discharged 10 days later. He remained seizure- and antiepileptic drug-free after discharge as of his 3-month follow-up.", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'14262318': 1, '6775582': 1, '2927648': 1, '32595976': 2, '3922283': 1, '4205070': 1, '32968572': 2, '25667834': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7505616-1': 1, '7297491-1': 1}"}
