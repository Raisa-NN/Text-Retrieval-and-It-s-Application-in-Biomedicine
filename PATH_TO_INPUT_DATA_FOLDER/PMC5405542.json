At a previous ophthalmic clinic, she had complained of a foreign body sensation. On suspicion of OSSN, a conjunctival biopsy was performed that revealed no malignant (Ki-67+) cells but an inflammatory lesion that contained CD3+ T cells and CD20+ B cells. She was treated with a topical steroid and topical antibiotics for 8 months, but the lesion persisted. When the patient was referred to our clinic, a slit-lamp examination revealed a granulomatous mass and calcium deposits in the center of a granuloma along with vascular injection on the superior bulbar conjunctiva (Fig. ). The cornea was relatively clear with no epithelial defects (Fig. ). We asked about a history of blepharoptosis surgery, and the patient had had upper blepharoplasty 5 years earlier. With eversion of the upper lid, diffuse papillary reaction and an exposed nonabsorbable suture were detected on the superior palpebral conjunctiva near the medial canthal area of the fornix (Fig. ). After the suture was removed (Fig. ), the granulomatous mass with calcific deposits was completely resolved (Fig. ).", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18480812': 1, '25665492': 1, '20181539': 1, '19331897': 1, '9037556': 1, '10336029': 1, '3301209': 1, '14711437': 1, '11004269': 1, '19341698': 1, '8587298': 1, '28446156': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5405542-1': 2}"}
