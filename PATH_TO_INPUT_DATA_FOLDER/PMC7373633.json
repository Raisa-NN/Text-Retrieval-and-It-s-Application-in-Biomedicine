Modified radical mastectomy was conducted, and postoperative pathology was triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma without lymph node involvement. About 20-mL yellow exudate was observed on the dressing on POD 2 and maintained about 50 to 100 mL each day. 68Ga-NEB PET/CT scan indicated a lymphatic leakage (Fig. ). Pressure dressing toward the left chest and low-fat diet were given. Drainage reduced gradually daily, and the patient was discharged 12 days after the examination. Then, she received 4 cycles of chemotherapy as expected with no additional complications and did not experience recurrence 2 years postoperatively.\\nBoth patients were diagnosed with lymphatic fistula preliminarily within 1 week after operation. The amount of the drainage was <300 mL each day, so we speculated that there was a small damage to the lymphatic branch. We confirmed our initial speculations by 68Ga-NEB PET/CT. Total general phase images showed increasing tracer intensity, and the lesion fusion phase showed the location of the chylous fistula. In both patients, the lymphatic fistula had a nodular appearance. We could even see the site of the fistula and leaking fluid labeled by 68Ga-NEB in the same image, and the labeled leaking fluid formed a drainage pool in front of the chest wall.", "age": "[[38.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'14997050': 1, '20030699': 1, '24842890': 1, '26859218': 1, '25320629': 2, '22493641': 2, '21729668': 1, '21969198': 1, '29063644': 1, '24155761': 1, '21076608': 1, '26251416': 1, '16800980': 1, '18547973': 1, '9043440': 1, '25535368': 1, '32702884': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7373633-1': 2, '4197361-1': 1, '3318166-1': 1}"}
