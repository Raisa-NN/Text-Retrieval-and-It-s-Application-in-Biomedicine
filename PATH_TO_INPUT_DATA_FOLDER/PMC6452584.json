Additional workup showed 7 g/dL of albuminuria, and kidney biopsy confirmed lambda-restricted amyloid protein deposition. The patient had a bleeding complication from kidney biopsy, which led to additional investigations confirming a low serum FX activity (20%). Splenomegaly was noted on the computed tomography of the abdomen. He had no bleeding history but reported easy bruising for the past 3 months. Serum protein electrophoresis showed 1.0 g/dL of IgG lambda monoclonal protein. Serum-free kappa and lambda light chain levels were 18 and 34 g/dL, respectively. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy confirmed 5% of lambda-restricted plasma cells. The patient opted against stem cell transplantation and underwent induction therapy with the bortezomib-based regimen. He achieved complete hematologic remission. Serum FX level improved but remained low at 35%. The patient was in an auto accident resulting in a splenic rupture. He underwent emergent splenectomy and required red blood cell transfusion during the procedure. The serum FX level improved to 52% within 1 month after the surgery.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'7036713': 1, '19141158': 1, '10971408': 1, '9518420': 1, '11298609': 1, '33728224': 2, '7207512': 1, '8980263': 1, '9401063': 1, '20052750': 1, '20609014': 1, '11238135': 1, '30947547': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6452584-1': 2, '7949742-1': 1}"}
