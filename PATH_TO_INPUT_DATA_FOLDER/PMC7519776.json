On the examination, he presented with asymmetrical ptosis on repetitive movement. Both sensory and motor functions were unaffected and were graded Class I on the MGFA classification. EMG did not show any abnormalities. The AchR antibody titers were elevated at 9.0 nM (was positive). The NCS showed repetitive stimulation of facial nerve \u201corbicularis oculi\u201d giving a positive decremental response. Histopathological analysis of the specimen showed thymic tissue with hyperplastic lymphoid tissue with many Hassel\u2019s corpuscles. No necrosis or nucleus anaplasia was detected. Chest CT scan revealed slightly prominent thymus gland in the anterior mediastinum due to reactive hyperplasia and no significantly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (). The patient was placed on pyridostigmine and steroids and was scheduled for open thymectomy.
