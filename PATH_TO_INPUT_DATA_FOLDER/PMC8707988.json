He was well otherwise, and there was no relevant family history. The ocular and medical history were also unremarkable. No abnormalities were reported after his first dose of COVID-19 vaccination (Sinopharm, China). He did not respond well to more than a one-month treatment of topical steroids. At presentation to our ophthalmic clinic, the slit-lamp examination revealed diffused corneal edema associated with underlying Descemet\u2019s fold, keratic precipitates and anterior chamber inflammation (A). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected significant viral loads of VZV DNA in the aqueous humor sample. Herein, herpetic corneal endotheliitis was diagnosed. His treatment regimen included topical steroids as well as topical and oral ganciclovir. The corneal edema was significantly reduced after a one-week treatment (B).", "age": "[[51.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34029238': 1, '34370972': 1, '33865883': 1, '28837183': 1, '34473193': 1, '34006829': 1, '34493563': 1, '27699152': 1, '34379565': 1, '29326426': 1, '34473209': 1, '33340022': 1, '34205861': 1, '33596348': 1, '34281760': 1, '34487581': 1, '34246358': 1, '20733030': 1, '10459967': 1, '34161702': 1, '193008': 1, '33910885': 1, '34960139': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8707988-1': 2}"}
