CT without contrast obtained at that time showed a lobulated hyperdense mass at the right CPA (Fig. ). Subsequent MRI showed a lobulated mass, hyperintense on T2, and homogeneously enhancing right CPA lesion (Fig. ). There were no signs of hydrocephalus. His neurological examination was intact.\\nHe underwent a posterior fossa craniotomy tumor resection. It was done through a hockey stick incision as outlined previously []. A homogeneous solid tumor was present in the right cerebellomedullary fissure of the CPA. The nerve roots of 7\u201310th cranial nerves of the right side were displaced ventrally. Medially the right-sided PICA gave rise multiple feeders to the tumor. The tumor appeared to be present in the expanded lateral recess with the tela choroidea surrounding it dorsally. There was no brainstem involvement. A piecemeal resection was done under surgical microscope, and a gross total resection was achieved. Pathology was consistent with CPP.\\nThe patient showed no postoperative neurological deficits. Presently, 21 months after the tumor resection, he shows no signs of tumor recurrence (Fig. ).", "age": "[[5.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30261376': 1, '27157931': 1, '16228955': 1, '21887168': 1, '9526979': 1, '18210099': 1, '16186520': 1, '7737660': 1, '21970783': 1, '27506402': 1, '26500797': 2, '11398945': 1, '6332280': 1, '2270789': 1, '26351227': 1, '1728390': 1, '2771002': 1, '12601462': 1, '3601026': 1, '3217283': 1, '8869707': 1, '30783805': 1, '22938081': 1, '32123998': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7355280-1': 2, '4596056-1': 1, '4596056-2': 1, '4596056-3': 1}"}
