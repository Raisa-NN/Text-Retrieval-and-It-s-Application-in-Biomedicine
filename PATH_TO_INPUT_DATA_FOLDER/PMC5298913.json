The patient also reported fatigue with a 10-pound weight loss over the preceding month. He denied fever, chills or night sweats. On physical examination, the spleen was palpable one finger breadth below the costal margin with mild adenopathy in the right and left inguinal regions. Pitting edema in the left lower extremity was present. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a large conglomeration of lymph nodes involving the right periaortic region extending to the right pelvic side wall with areas of central necrosis. Also seen was a right inguinal lymph node measuring about 2.8 x 2.1 cm and splenomegaly. A CT scan of the chest showed extensive mediastinal adenopathy measuring up to 1.3 x 1.4 cm and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy with the largest lymph node measuring 1.5 x 1.1 cm.\\nInitial blood work showed a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 634 U/L, white cell count of 7.36 million cells/mcL with a normal differential, hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL and a platelet count of 276,000/microliter. Coagulation studies and a comprehensive metabolic panel were within normal limits.\\nAn excisional biopsy of the right inguinal lymph node was performed, and pathologic exam revealed a biphasic lymphoid population consisting of a large cell population strongly positive for B-cell antigens, CD20 and PAX5, and germinal center cell antigens, CD10 and BCL6. Ki-67 was expressed in 80-90% of the cells. The cell regulatory protein p53 was expressed in the majority of the larger cells, supporting the diagnosis of germinal center-like large B-cell lymphoma. Unexpectedly, the small cell component was also positive for the B-cell antigens, CD20 and PAX 5, with aberrant co-expression of the T-cell antigen CD43 (dim). Distinct nuclear positivity for cyclin D1 (BCL1) was present. BCL2 was also positive, consistent with a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma. Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) in situ hybridization was negative (Figure ).\\nTo confirm the presence of two clonally unrelated neoplasms rather than large cell transformation of MCL, PCR analysis of IGH chain and IGK light chain gene rearrangements were performed on the two components after macrodissection. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was positive for rearrangement of CCND1/IGH in 13% of the cells and multiple gains of chromosomes resulting from the t(11;14) (q13;q32) translocation, which is most commonly associated with MCL. Hence, we reached the final diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma CD10 positive (80-90% large cell lymphoma) and MCL (10-20%).\\nSubsequently, the patient underwent a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan which revealed extensive fluorodeoxyglucose-avid (FDG-avid) lymphadenopathy above and below the diaphragm with a maximum standard uptake value (SUV) of 39.8 measured at the 15 x 7.5 cm conglomerate of lymph nodes within the right pelvic sidewall. Multiple FDG-avid lesions were also seen within the liver and spleen along with a right rib lesion.\\nBone marrow biopsy and aspirate findings were consistent with mild hypercellularity (50-60%) with increased interstitial lymphocytes, predominantly small to medium in size with irregular nuclei and distinct nuclear positivity for cyclin D1 (BCL1). Immunohistochemistry and FISH studies were consistent with mantle cell lymphoma with no evidence of large cell lymphoma. Further studies included cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which was negative for malignant cells. Multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan showed an ejection fraction of 68%. The patient was treated with six cycles of a chemotherapy drug combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, Oncovin\u00ae and prednisone (R-CHOP), along with four doses of intrathecal methotrexate given with the first four cycles of chemotherapy. A central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis was administered because of the presence of visceral and rib disease. A repeat PET-CT scan after the completion of chemotherapy showed resolution of the previously FDG-avid lesions, and bone marrow biopsy was negative for the presence of any lymphoproliferative disorder. The patient is currently on consolidation chemotherapy and has received two cycles of cytarabine to be followed by high-dose methotrexate. He is planned to undergo an autologous stem cell transplantation following consolidation.", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24565206': 1, '26755518': 1, '8475911': 1, '28133582': 2, '25186047': 1, '22090393': 1, '33849639': 2, '26096944': 1, '25499451': 1, '28191367': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5268376-1': 1, '8045388-1': 1}"}
