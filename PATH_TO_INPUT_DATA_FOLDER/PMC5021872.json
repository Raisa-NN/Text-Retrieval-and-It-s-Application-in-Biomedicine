He had a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. A mass lesion was noted in the liver, and he was subsequently admitted to our hospital.\\nOn admission, his blood cell counts and serum bilirubin were within the normal ranges. However, his serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated to 88 (U/L), 150 (U/L), and 2090 (U/L), respectively. His CA19-9 levels were elevated to 42 U/mL at admission and 175 U/mL before surgical operation (2 months after admission) (cut-off, <37 U/mL), while his CEA levels remained approximately 2.0\u20132.4 ng/mL (cut-off, <5.0 ng/mL). Abdominal enhanced CT revealed a 60 mm cystic tumor mainly in segment 4, involving the hilar bile ducts (). However, ERCP revealed no communication between the cystic tumor and the adjacent bile ducts. The proximal intrahepatic bile ducts of the anterior and medial branch and medial segment branches were dilated. Under a diagnosis of intrahepatic CCA, left hepatic trisectionectomy was performed. The postoperative course for this patient was uneventful. The carcinoma has not recurred in the past 6 months.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22021503': 1, '22262399': 1, '11743055': 1, '9330346': 1, '31996362': 1, '20518896': 1, '17058219': 1, '33317146': 1, '15104295': 1, '24458517': 1, '22371217': 1, '25966428': 1, '2165033': 1, '26774364': 1, '17616258': 1, '26900302': 1, '30982236': 1, '22126388': 1, '29895797': 1, '26904350': 2, '19322511': 1, '16741522': 1, '27656307': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5021872-1': 2, '4745865-1': 1}"}
