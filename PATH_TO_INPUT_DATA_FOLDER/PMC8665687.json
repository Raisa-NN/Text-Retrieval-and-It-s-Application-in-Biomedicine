His history was presented with motor and mental retardation accompanied by occasional seizures. Family history was unremarkable. Vital signs including pulse, temperature, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were all normal limits. Laboratory evaluations were nothing unremarkable. Physical examination revealed mild scalp swelling in the right parietal region. The patient presented with a headache with delayed mental and motor response. He underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, which showed skull fracture with epidural hematoma in the right parietal region (Figure ). Furthermore, there were severe brain defects with bilateral wide clefts and absence of septum pellucidum and corpus callosum (Figure ). Due to the motion artifacts, magnetic resonance imaging technique was not performed despite the best efforts. The patient received only conservative treatment and was discharged from the hospital later. The boy was followed up showing remission of the hematoma after 2 weeks. However, the growth retardation remained unchanged as no cure for the problem was found.", "age": "[[5.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23503883': 1, '30027296': 1, '21026933': 1, '30501885': 1, '25473439': 1, '23266945': 1, '15888615': 1, '25690450': 2, '29302567': 2, '34938544': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4359713-1': 1, '4359713-2': 1, '4359713-3': 1, '5749106-1': 1}"}
