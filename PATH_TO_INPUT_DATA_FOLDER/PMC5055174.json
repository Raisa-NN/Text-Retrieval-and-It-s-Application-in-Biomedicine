The patient was a 52-year-old woman with a solitary metastasis of the lumbar spine. She underwent total thyroidectomy for a papillary carcinoma 19 months before admission to our hospital. On admission, she had significant lower back pain, which impaired her performance of ADL (KPS score: 70%). However, she did not have any neurologic deficits. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed an osteolytic bone metastasis involving the 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebrae (Fig. ). She underwent TES involving a posterior-anterior combined approach (Fig. ). One hundred months after the surgery, her performance of ADL was nearly normal (KPS score: 90%). She underwent radioiodine treatment for multiple lung metastases. Postoperative radiological images of the lumbar spine demonstrated that the reconstructed lumbar spine was well maintained, and no local tumor recurrence in the operated spine or newly developed BMs was observed.", "age": "[[52.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22827579': 1, '16205345': 1, '23076644': 1, '20887137': 1, '31179610': 1, '30481978': 1, '4931082': 1, '24921429': 1, '29663145': 1, '18310274': 1, '11297585': 1, '34194637': 1, '10779141': 1, '21892275': 1, '30545326': 1, '32227458': 1, '34076920': 1, '34503240': 1, '22176498': 1, '22751346': 1, '21184643': 1, '24150193': 1, '33553403': 2, '19064055': 1, '26104753': 1, '24827757': 1, '12518372': 1, '16684830': 1, '7852009': 1, '34881284': 1, '12501164': 1, '33198816': 1, '12892796': 1, '15963067': 1, '11940050': 1, '12174953': 1, '19539179': 1, '32743746': 1, '23079721': 1, '22564664': 1, '19860577': 1, '27431619': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7829725-1': 1}"}
