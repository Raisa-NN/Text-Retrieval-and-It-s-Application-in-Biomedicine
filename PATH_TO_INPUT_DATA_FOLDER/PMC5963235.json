Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. At 28 weeks of gestation, the pregnancy was complicated by a fetal diagnosis of atrial septal defect (ASD) of the secundum type, TAPVR, and congenital second-degree heart block with 2:1 conduction (atrial rate of 110\u2013118 beats/min and ventricular rate of 55\u201358 beats/min) at 32 weeks of gestation. The four pulmonary veins were returning to the coronary sinus. A subsequent fetal echocardiogram showed additional vascular anomalies such as bilateral superior vena cava (SVC), left SVC draining into the coronary sinus, and an interrupted inferior vena cava (IVC) with a continuation of the azygos vein to the right SVC. Family history was negative for congenital anomalies. There was no in utero exposure to any known teratogens. Physical examination revealed a weight of 3200 g (50th centile), length of 48 cm (30th centile), and a head circumference of 34 cm (60th centile). No visible anomalies were noted. The infant was mildly cyanotic with pulse oximetric saturation values of 85%\u201394%. Postnatal echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of TAPVR draining to the coronary sinus, bilateral SVC without bridging vein, interrupted IVC with azygos vein continuing to the right SVC, and a large (4 mm) secundum type of ASD []. A small perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) and a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were also noted []. Electrocardiogram confirmed 2:1 heart block with a resting heart rate of 60 beats/min []. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion. Abdominal ultrasound showed normal appearance and location of liver and spleen. The infant underwent cardiac surgery and a permanent pacemaker placement at 9 days of age. She was discharged home at 3 weeks of age. When seen at 2-month follow-up, she was doing well.\\nA CGH array analysis of a peripheral blood sample revealed an 818 kb duplication of the long arm of chromosome 1 \u2212 arr 1q32.2 (209,809,645 \u2212 210,427,436) \u00d7 3 []. Single nucleotide polymorphism oligonucleotide microarray analysis indicated a gain of chromosome 1 from positions 209,609,645 \u2212 2010,427,436. The duplicated region contained 11 genes, seven of which are OMIM annotated and four (LAMB3, HSD11B1, IRF6, and SYT14) of which have known disease associations.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'4273004': 1, '11755298': 1, '22368629': 1, '12833404': 1, '16086176': 1, '17605151': 1, '11509847': 1, '9138155': 1, '19248177': 1, '8160748': 1, '1962287': 1, '29922018': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
