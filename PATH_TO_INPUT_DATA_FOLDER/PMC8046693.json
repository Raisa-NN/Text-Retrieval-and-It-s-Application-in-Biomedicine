Interestingly, she had a similar presentation two-years prior with anterior and inferolateral ST-elevations on electrocardiogram (ECG) (Figure ), normal coronary angiography, and echocardiography (ECHO) revealing SIC with ejection fraction (EF) 45%. That presentation was attributed to SIC secondary to seizure with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.\\nUpon this presentation, she was started on anti-seizure medications and empiric antibiotics for concern for meningitis. Her brain MRI was notable for multiple areas of acute infarcts in bilateral cerebral hemispheres while her ECG revealed ST-segment elevations in V2-V5 (Figure ).\\nOn presentation, she had blood pressure (BP) of 75/51 mmHg and a heart rate (HR) of 83 beats per minute (bpm). Lactic acid was 1.3 mmol/L (normal < 2.2 mmol/L). Arterial blood gas revealed metabolic acidosis on 4L oxygen via nasal cannula: pH 7.23, pCO2 38 mmHg, pO2 194 mmHg, HCO3 15.5 mmol/L. The troponin rose from 0.097 to 6.328 ng/mL (normal < 0.032 ng/mL). No kidney injury was present and the creatinine was at the patient's baseline (1.0 mg/dL). No acute liver injury was present. She was initially started on Norepinephrine (0.27 mcg/kg/min), Vasopressin (0.04 units/min), and Dobutamine (8 mcg/kg/min) to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg. Coronary angiography revealed mild non-obstructive CAD (Figure ).\\nShe was found to be in cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.2 L/min/m2 and cardiac output of 2.1 L/min, calculated during coronary angiography by calculating Fick\u2019s cardiac output and index by measuring oxygen saturation in the pulmonary artery and aortic blood samples. This required the placement of a right axillary Impella CP. A right axillary approach was chosen to allow for earlier and easier mobilization and rehabilitation, compared to a femoral approach. Following Impella CP placement, Vasopressin was discontinued, and the rates of infusion were decreased for norepinephrine (0.07 mcg/kg/min) and dobutamine (6 mcg/kg/min). ECHO revealed grade 3 diastolic dysfunction, SIC, and severe global systolic dysfunction, EF 27% (Figure ).\\nThe following day, norepinephrine infusion was gradually decreased until discontinuation, and dobutamine infusion rate was further decreased (5 mcg/kg/min). On the second day following Impella CP placement, Dobutamine was decreased and discontinued in the morning. The flow on the Impella CP device was gradually decreased (P-8 to P-2), she remained hemodynamically stable (BP 114/68 mmHg, MAP 99 mmHg, HR 98 bpm) and the Impella CP was explanted in the afternoon on the second day. Repeat ECHO one-week later revealed LV EF of 30-35%, she remained hemodynamically stable and did not develop any subsequent end-organ injury.\\nShe was discharged to a skilled nursing facility safely on day 13 of the admission. On follow-up after five months, she was doing well and had no readmissions. Follow-up repeat ECHO was yet to be completed. She was continued on beta-blocker and angiotensin-receptor blocker therapies for her cardiomyopathy.", "age": "[[65.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18294473': 1, '11451258': 1, '18797121': 1, '21864371': 2, '20486954': 1, '18508143': 1, '18506637': 1, '25953675': 1, '32473281': 1, '31228028': 1, '28367338': 2, '33880265': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3177926-1': 1, '5359432-1': 1}"}
