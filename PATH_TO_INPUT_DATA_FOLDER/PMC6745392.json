MRI study revealed a 2.7 \u00d7 3.1 \u00d7 3.9 cm well-circumscribed hypervascular mass at left carotid bifurcation. The mass was isointense in T1W (Figure A), heterogeneous hyperintense in T2W (Figure B), and intensely enhancing after gadolinium injection (Figure C). Flow-void sign with salt-and-pepper appearance was also noted (arrow). MR angiography demonstrated a tumor splaying at the carotid bifurcation (Figure D). The findings from the MRI support the diagnosis of a paraganglioma.", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'34185291': 1, '27154608': 1, '15809825': 1, '31534761': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
