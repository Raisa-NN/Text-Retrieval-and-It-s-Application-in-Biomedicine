The patient did not use steroids any longer and was in remission for 8 months. She presented with multiple skin nodules on the chest and back, a history of intermittent fever, headache, and mild itching at the abdominal scar site for 3 months. In addition, the patient had a history of laparotomy performed 20 years ago.\\nBlood examination revealed elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels. The patient was suspected of disease relapse; therefore, she was subjected to 18F-FDG PET/CT to investigate her current disease status. The 18F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated increased FDG uptake in multiple subcutaneous nodules (small white arrow), mediastinal nodes (blue arrow), bilateral lung parenchymal involvement (red arrows), and anterior abdominal wall scar (thick white arrow) with the involvement of the omentum (curved white arrow; ).\\nTo confirm the disease relapse and investigate the scar involvement, the patient was subjected to the biopsy of the scar site (i.e., metabolically active [FDG positive] site). Biopsy revealed multiple epithelioid cell granulomas with giant cells (black arrow) surrounding the collagenous fibers of scar tissue, thereby confirming the sarcoid infiltration of the scar site ().", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9236527': 1, '26399844': 1, '19119259': 1, '18032765': 1, '23354040': 1, '11312418': 1, '30233763': 1, '17560305': 1, '18078409': 1, '31380459': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
