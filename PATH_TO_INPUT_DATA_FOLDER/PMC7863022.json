He also complained of productive cough with whitish sputum. Vital signs were normal and physical examination was benign. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed evidence of consolidation, which was followed by a computed tomography (CT) chest that revealed a dilated esophagus (Figure ). Barium swallow was done for optimal evaluation of dilated esophagus (Figure ). Post-procedure CXR revealed interval development of complete opacification of left hemithorax and retained barium in the left upper chest (Figure ). CT chest was followed, which revealed retained barium within the upper to the mid-thoracic esophagus. Complete left lung atelectasis was noted, likely related to the obstructing filling defect within the left main bronchus (Figure ). Subsequently, the CXR showed persistently retained contrast within the esophagus and improved left lobar airspace disease with moderate to large pleural effusion (Figure ). However, bedside sonogram showed predominantly consolidation. The patient had no symptoms and was clinically stable to be discharged. He was advised to follow up as an outpatient at the chest clinic in six weeks.", "age": "[[73.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12928969': 1, '2758750': 1, '25829647': 1, '5506625': 1, '9973698': 1, '15763294': 1, '32355903': 2, '15610809': 1, '12637611': 1, '21865311': 1, '33564548': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7189819-1': 1}"}
