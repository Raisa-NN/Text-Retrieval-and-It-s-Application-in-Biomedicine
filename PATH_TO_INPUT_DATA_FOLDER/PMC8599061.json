She sustained a type 3 B fracture with subsequent development of osteomyelitis of the right tibia as a result of being hit by a bicycle. She was initially managed by the Orthopaedic team at another institution prior to the referral to Plastic Surgery. Three months post-injury there was a joint surgery between Orthopaedic and Plastic Surgery teams. Debridement of the bone was first performed followed by elevation of a soleus muscle flap which was covered with an FTSG. Approximately 3 weeks post-operation, it was reported that she had developed a flaring osteomyelitis of the right tibia and returned to surgery for bony debridement and that the flap had been lost. However, upon later examination under general anaesthesia by the Plastic Surgery team, the presence of a healthy soleus muscle was noted and this was readvanced to cover the tibia. The muscle was then covered with an STSG and she went on to complete healing ().", "age": "[[8.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19941216': 1, '4759972': 1, '24225604': 1, '21067051': 1, '34804475': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8599061-1': 2}"}
