On examination, the swellings had soft to firm consistency and size of about 5\u00d75 cm. Another swelling was noted on anterior chest wall adjacent to manubrium sternii on left side for last 1 month. No other significant past history was given at this point. Radiological investigations also did not give any evidence of non-neoplastic or neoplastic lesion. Fine needle aspiration from all the three swellings was done.\\nOn examining the smears from right arm and lower back swellings, normal looking adipocytes in a lipid rich background were seen. A diagnosis of lipoma was made. Smears from chest wall swelling were stained by May-Gr\u03ccnwald-Giemsa (MGG) and Papanicolaou (Pap) stains. Smears were moderately cellular and showed variable number of large single cells and clusters of poorly cohesive cells tending to form acini at places []. Cells showed low nucleocytoplasmic (N/C) ratio, abundant pale cytoplasm with vacuoles and relatively indistinct cell borders. In some cells, nuclei were totally or partially stripped of cytoplasm, and some had large nucleoli and bland chromatin. In a few cells, intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions were noted. Background was pale, foamy and vacuolated []. Based on smear examination, a diagnosis of \u201cclear cell malignant tumor, possibly metastatic RCC\u201d was made.\\nInitially, the patient did not give any significant past history, but on further questioning, he revealed a history of kidney mass that was operated 9 years back at some other centre. Histopathology revealed it to be clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Biopsy of the chest swelling was advised for further confirmation, which showed metastatic RCC [].", "age": "[[62.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21938168': 2, '6163367': 1, '3761436': 1, '7966685': 1, '20178706': 1, '4336632': 1, '2242976': 1, '10928130': 1, '25972645': 1, '2920251': 1, '841351': 1, '24455326': 2, '21552405': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3168011-1': 1, '3168011-2': 1, '3888720-1': 1}"}
