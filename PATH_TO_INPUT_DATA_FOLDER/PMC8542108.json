Hard exudate, IRF, and SRF were observed. One IVA was administered for the left eye 5 months after symptom onset. Although IRF disappeared, residual SRF were observed. Because of persistent bilateral blurred vision and because he had a history of cerebral infarction, 1 triamcinolone acetonide sub-Tenon injection was administered for the both eyes 1 month after the IVA. Blurred vision and IRF progressed. Therefore, he was referred to our hospital 7 months after the onset. Multiple red patches and exudate were observed in both eyes and his BCVA was 20/50 and 20/30 in the right and left eye, respectively. Eventually, retinal specialists diagnosed the case as BDUMP based on the characteristic fundus findings. Three monthly IVA were administered for both eyes 9 months after the onset. The exudate resolved 2 months after the therapy. At the final visit, 4 months after the therapy, no recurrence of exudates was observed, and his BCVA was 20/66 and 20/100 in the right and left eye, respectively. He was lost to follow up. No adverse event occurred after the therapy at the time of his last visit.", "age": "[[75.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18538401': 1, '28636126': 1, '24763691': 1, '2322154': 1, '30243734': 1, '28983556': 1, '31755473': 2, '34678904': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8542108-1': 2, '8542108-2': 2, '6896546-1': 1}"}
