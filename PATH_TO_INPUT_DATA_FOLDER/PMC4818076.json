Previous treatments included oral antibiotics and standard wound care dressings. Prior to epidermal grafting, the heel wound underwent NPWT set at \u2013125 mmHg in continuous mode for the first day and then in intermittent mode for six days with one dressing change. Epidermal grafts were applied on both wounds from a single epidermal graft taken from the left thigh and divided between the two wounds. A course of prophylactic oral antibiotics was given. The wound bed was prepared and had healthy granulation tissue suitable for graft take in both wounds; wound epithelialization was observed by four weeks following epidermal grafting. The pressure ulcer on the right heel (Figure ), the ulcer on the left knee (Figure ), and the donor site healed without complications.", "age": "[[35.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15860447': 1, '16291068': 1, '12567064': 1, '25658643': 1, '15147985': 1, '20139336': 1, '26258460': 1, '24377441': 1, '24988511': 1, '9699726': 1, '25335459': 1, '17140820': 1, '12794466': 1, '15469216': 1, '22299038': 1, '14149183': 1, '21655269': 1, '29076239': 1, '28198101': 1, '12634539': 1, '12843410': 1, '25104506': 1, '22572416': 1, '32426535': 1, '10977021': 1, '25433225': 1, '26765157': 1, '24065417': 1, '17485264': 1, '33092648': 1, '33269244': 1, '17161778': 1, '14706575': 1, '23271060': 1, '27054051': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4818076-1': 2}"}
