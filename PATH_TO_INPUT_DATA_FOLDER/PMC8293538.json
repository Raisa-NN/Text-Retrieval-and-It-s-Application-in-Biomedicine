The possibility of foreign bodies in the trachea was considered according to the medical history and physical examination results, and the patient was escorted to the inpatient ward. In the process of preoperative examination, the patient cried during the blood drawing in the treatment room with sudden asphyxia and cyanosis of the complexion. Emergency endotracheal intubation was carried out with balloon-assisted respiration, and the complexion of the patient returned to normal. After the establishment of a first-aid fast track, more secretions were found in the trachea during the operation, and apple pieces were observed above the tracheae carina. After the foreign body was removed, the child was transferred to the PICU with tracheal intubation for monitoring.
