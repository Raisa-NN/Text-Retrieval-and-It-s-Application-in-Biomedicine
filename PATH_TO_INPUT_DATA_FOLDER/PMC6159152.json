There was no known relevant history. Urgent triple phase CT demonstrated a right gastric artery aneurysm, located near the region of its anatomical anastomosis with the left gastric artery. No definite active haemorrhage was seen at the time of the study. A very large volume haemoperitoneum was present. A haematoma with epicentre at the lesser omentum/lesser sac was present. The haematoma displaced the lesser curvature of the stomach inferolaterally and filled the lesser sac. There was mild compressive mass effect on the anterior aspect of the pancreas. Emergent surgery was performed, and the aneurysm oversewn. The patient made complete recovery.", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21665424': 1, '20249245': 1, '5489293': 1, '22262112': 1, '29123747': 1, '25827968': 1, '24386016': 1, '30363178': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6159152-1': 2}"}
