Dysphagia led to the diagnosis of gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in October 2011. Three cycles of EOC were administered preoperatively, and then a total gastrectomy was performed in February 2012. On pathological examination, the tumor was classified as ypT3N1 (1 positive node on the lesser curvature of the stomach/28 nodes examined; group 3 in the Japanese classification) and overexpressed Her2+++. Then, systemic chemotherapy (EOC) was resumed for 3 more cycles until March 2012. In February 2015, a 2-cm splenic hypodensity was discovered on CT scan. In March 2015, a splenectomy was performed, and no peritoneal carcinomatosis or liver metastases were detected. The nodule was 45 mm in larger diameter, infiltrated by adenocarcinoma cells and classified as overexpressed Her2+++; the capsule was invaded, but the resection was considered R0. In June 2015, multiple liver metastases were disclosed, and systemic chemotherapy of 3 cycles of 5-FU-CDDP-trastuzumab was given. After these 3 cycles, the patient had a complete response. Trastuzumab alone was given (i.e., due to neurotoxicity related to the platinum derivatives in the previous regimen) for 3 additional months. The patient is still in complete remission as of February 2016.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20981101': 1, '25224659': 1, '20728210': 1, '26313663': 1, '23964159': 1, '10747308': 1, '25753188': 1, '27065846': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4821136-1': 2}"}
