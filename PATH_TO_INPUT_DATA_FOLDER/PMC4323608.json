She wanted to reduce her neck wrinkle and achieve a clear and white appearance of the neck skin. Intradermal RF to reduce the neck wrinkle and chemical peeling to achieve a clear skin tone were performed. Before intradermal RF, 30% glycolic acid (GA) was applied on her neck for 2 min to peel the skin, and then sodium bicarbonate was applied to neutralize the acid. After peeling, she received the same protocol of intradermal RF treatments as in case 1. The whole procedure was performed for 3 months with a 4-week interval. After 3 months, an excellent posttreatment outcome was observed; the depth of the wrinkle was reduced considerably, and the surface of her neck had a smooth and clear appearance (). She showed slight erythema on the penetration site for 3~5 days after treatment; however, there were no adverse effects. She was very satisfied with the result of the treatment.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11702315': 1, '20384760': 1, '22984657': 1, '16042936': 1, '15056138': 1, '21950544': 1, '12877230': 1, '33580613': 1, '18053051': 1, '23731587': 1, '25673937': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4323608-1': 2}"}
