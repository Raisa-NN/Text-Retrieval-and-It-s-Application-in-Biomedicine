It started with an abnormal lower limb posture and limping followed by neck and limb posturing with truncal deviation to one side while walking. With time, the abnormality persisted at rest and worsened on activity. There was mild diurnal variation and sleep improved his symptoms considerably. He was evaluated for the complaints elsewhere and was being treated as dystonic cerebral palsy with trihexyphenidyl and physiotherapy.\\nExamination revealed a mentally normal boy with no Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings or hepatosplenomegaly. He had generalized dystonia involving the neck, trunk, and upper limbs at rest [] with worsening on gait examination and additional lower limb dystonia on walking. His routine blood investigations were normal. In addition, peripheral smear examination for acanthocytes, serum ceruloplasmin levels, and thyroid tests were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging brain did not show any abnormality. Generalized dystonia at this young age with diurnal variations and no other abnormality led us to suspect DRD, and a trial of L-dopa was given; after 3 days of therapy, his dystonia completely improved []. He is on regular follow-up and maintaining improvement while on low-dose L-dopa therapy.", "age": "[[14.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16289769': 1, '945938': 1, '32183506': 1, '31380813': 1, '30911941': 1, '22986512': 1, '24844652': 1, '11568387': 1, '28904579': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
