On inspection and physical examination,\\na nontender, hard bony lump was palpable on the volar aspect of the enlarged second\\ntoe (). X-ray and non-contrast-enhanced\\nCT of the foot were ordered for further evaluation. The X-ray showed marked\\nhypertrophy of the right second toe, accompanied by enlargement of the phalanges,\\nsoft tissue hypertrophy, degenerative changes (in the proximal and distal\\ninterphalangeal joints), and dense bony outgrowths at the medial end of the joints\\n(). The CT scan demonstrated marked\\nsoft-tissue hypertrophy containing abnormal hypodense (\u201350 to \u2013120 HU) areas of fat\\nattenuation (). Bony expansion with\\nthickened and sclerotic cortices of the proximal phalanx, fusion of the (proximal\\nand distal) interphalangeal joints, and small bony protuberances arising from medial\\nend of the joints was seen causing compression over the big toe (, , and ).
