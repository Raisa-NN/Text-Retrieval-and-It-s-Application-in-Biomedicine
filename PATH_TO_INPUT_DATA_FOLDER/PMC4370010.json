Five months post TACE, she developed worsening abdominal discomfort, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scan showed evidence of progressive disease with increased FDG uptake in lesions involving segments 2, 3, 7 and 8 (Fig. a). She was treated with selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) using yttrium-90 (90Y) microspheres (SIR-Spheres\u00ae), which were infused into left, middle and right hepatic arteries (Fig. a). At 9-week follow-up, her abdominal discomfort had resolved and FDG-PET/CT scan demonstrated a near complete metabolic response (Fig. b). Subsequent angiography revealed parasitized arterial supply to the segment 7 tumour from the inferior phrenic artery, which would explain the inadequate perfusion and dose delivery of 90Y microspheres (Fig. a, cross-hairs) with only a partial response of the single lesion (Fig. b, cross-hairs).", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21038413': 1, '21296855': 1, '17312068': 1, '22353262': 1, '19766639': 1, '25988077': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
