History of thyroid dysfunction or neck radiation was negative and her thyroid function test was normal. Physical examination showed a soft, non-tender mass in midline of the neck at the level of hyoid bone. Ultrasonography was requested that revealed a 22\u00d710 mm cystic structure in the neck midline and also a 7 mm hypoechoic nodule with irregular border and taller than wide shape in the thyroid left lobe. Sono guided FNA was done for thyroid nodule which was suspicious for papillary carcinoma in cytology report. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy in addition to Sistrunk procedure for thyroglossal duct cyst. In pathology report, the thyroid nodule was papillary micro carcinoma (6mm in diameter) without capsular, perineural and blood vessel invasion ().\\nThe thyroglossal duct cyst had no tumoral involvement. Two out of three dissected neck lymph nodes were involved (0.2 and 0.3 mm in diameter). Now, after 3 months of operation, she in on 850 \u00b5g/week levothyroxine and neck ultrasonography did not show any residual or recurrence and lymphadenopathy and laboratory tests (suppressed thyroglobulin and antithyroglobulin) are acceptable.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16845854': 1, '27339199': 1, '27833882': 1, '15664568': 1, '24985922': 1, '25135577': 1, '24860793': 1, '27794246': 1, '34987876': 2, '16538412': 1, '28322121': 1, '19565286': 1, '24057908': 1, '9121176': 1, '7992750': 1, '7169333': 1, '12163999': 1, '24457400': 1, '21526005': 1, '18314017': 1, '9728193': 1, '11870661': 1, '21453651': 1, '11510730': 1, '23293327': 1, '32042395': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6992716-1': 2, '6992716-2': 2, '6992716-3': 2, '8720604-1': 1}"}
