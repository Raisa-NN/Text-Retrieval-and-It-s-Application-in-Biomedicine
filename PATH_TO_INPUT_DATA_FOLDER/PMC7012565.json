He had no fever, urinary symptoms, incontinence, trauma, weight loss, or saddle anesthesia. He had a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Physical examination showed tenderness to palpation of the suprapubic region, normal testicles, no inguinal hernias, and hyperpigmentation extending from the groin to the left mid-thigh. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated creatinine of 1.56 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (normal 0.60 to 1.30 mg/dL), creatine kinase (CK) of 177 units per liter (U/L) (normal 24 \u2013 223 U/L), C-reactive protein (CRP) of 180 mg/L (normal <10.01 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 106 millimeters per hour (mm/hr) (normal 2 \u2013 37 mm/hr). Hemoglobin A1c was 11.4% (normal 4.0 \u2013 6.4%), consistent with his longstanding history of poorly controlled diabetes.\\nUltrasound of scrotum and computed tomography of the abdomen/pelvis were both non-diagnostic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the bilateral lower extremities (see ), revealed acute myoedema involving the left obturator internus, externus and proximal adductor muscles of the left thigh. Findings were concerning for acute myositis likely secondary to diabetic muscle infarction. The patient was admitted for pain and glucose control. CRP down-trended to 110 mg/L prior to discharge and acute kidney injury resolved.", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16357690': 1, '8873484': 1, '34335786': 2, '12502683': 1, '25932331': 1, '32064441': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8294950-1': 1}"}
