The headaches had a migraine-like phenotype. She did not have any significant past medical history and no family history of migraines. Neuro-imaging (MRI Head and MR Venogram) did not reveal an alternative cause of raised ICP and an LP recorded an opening pressure of 54 cm CSF (followed by post-LP headache exacerbation for 1 week). A diagnosis of IIH was made []. She was commenced on acetazolamide and advised to lose weight. Neither acetazolamide nor topiramate were tolerated and did not improve her chronic migraine-like headaches that remained over 12 months. Following weight loss, the papilloedema resolved but migraine-like headaches persisted. Due to risk of weight gain, tricyclics and beta-blockers were contraindicated and erenumab was initiated which improved her headaches (Table ). At follow-up weight gain was noted and clinical examination revealed return of papilloedema. She was commenced on acetazolamide and advised to lose weight. Papilloedema subsequently improved. Her headaches remained controlled on erenumab despite the IIH relapse.", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'29504482': 1, '23771276': 1, '30356129': 1, '33580185': 1, '30878991': 1, '30547900': 1, '34620087': 1, '23966248': 1, '33316102': 1, '25982204': 1, '29903905': 1, '30298346': 1, '34073844': 1, '25070715': 1, '34062792': 1, '34629054': 1, '28460892': 1, '32988380': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7523364-1': 2, '7523364-2': 2, '7523364-3': 2, '7523364-4': 2, '7523364-5': 2, '7523364-6': 2}"}
