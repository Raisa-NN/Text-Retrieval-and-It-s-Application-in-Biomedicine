He had been diagnosed with a cerebral infarction 5 years ago, and there was no special sequestration. Although he was diagnosed with tuberculosis 20 years ago, he had been successfully cured. Chest X-ray showed some diffuse pneumonic consolidations in bilateral lower left lung fields, underlying pulmonary emphysema, and old tuberculosis foci traces. Pulmonary function test also indicated severe obstructive lung defect with forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.98 L (80%), forced expiratory volume-one second (FEV1) of 1.25 (50%), and FEV1/FVC 42%. Continuous oxygen therapy was carried out. Upon admission, the patient was on oxygen mask. The first blood pressure reading was 150/77 mm Hg, the pulse rate was 77 beats per minute, and the SpO2 was 92%.\\nThe nerve block method was the same as that in case 1. Total operation time was 62 minutes, and total anesthesia time was 1 hour and 40 minutes. He did not particularly complain of pain during the operation, but also experienced urinary discomfort. After self-voiding urine, the surgery was resumed. No major abnormality was reported during recovery, and he felt no pain until 6 hours after operation. He was discharged on the same day approximately 8 hours after surgery. No postoperative complications were noted.", "age": "[[80.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27142209': 1, '26397443': 1, '20395851': 1, '19860241': 1, '7986138': 1, '15048759': 1, '14625752': 1, '27487311': 1, '25575582': 1, '29901585': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6023657-1': 2}"}
