In magnetic resonance imaging, a capillary-venous-lymphatic malformation was observed in the right anterior, lateral, and posterior chest wall and right axilla, as well as in the right upper extremity and right supraclavicular area. The lesions were mainly located in the subcutaneous layer, but extended into the intermuscular space in the right chest wall.
