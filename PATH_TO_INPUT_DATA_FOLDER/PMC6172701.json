Echocardiographic examination showed severe degenerative aortic valve insufficiency, enlarged left ventricle (end diastolic diameter=64 mm) and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (55%). Medical history revealed recurrent epistaxis and spontaneous bone fractures. An aortic valve intervention was planned based on the symptoms and echocardiographic results. Ozaki procedure was preferred choice of treatment related to bleeding tendency and the risk for prosthetic valve dehiscence. The technical details were described previously by Ozaki et al. []. Briefly, this technique can be described as the placement of the patient\u2019s own pericardium into the aortic annulus following trimming and preparation according to the leaflet size (Fig. ). Following the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass, transesophageal echocardiography showed no aortic valve regurgitation and gradient (2 mmHg) across the valve (Fig. ). Postoperative follow-up was uneventful and the patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day. As an antiaggregant therapy just acetylsalicylic acid (300 mg) was prescribed. The transthoracic echocardiography showed no regurgitation or other pathological signs at one year follow-up.", "age": "[[37.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24876219': 1, '16039963': 1, '23791715': 1, '21924147': 1, '23228404': 1, '30310641': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
