Case report", "patient": "A 31-year-old woman presented to our clinic complaining of right eye pain and cosmetic appearance. She had a history of perforating trauma of the right eye due to a car crash ten years before. At that time, she underwent vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and had several reattachment procedures over the years. On the eye exam, the right eye had no light perception, the right cornea had a central epithelial defect, with fine dust-like subepithelial deposits, emulsified silicone oil in the anterior chamber, a round, nonreactive pupil and corectopia, and it revealed postoperative aphakia (). The fundus examination of the right eye revealed full-thickness fixed retinal folds in three quadrants and subretinal strands. The left eye was normal.\\nA standard evisceration technique with a polymethylmethacrylate implant was used. When the eyeball content was removed, a hard mass could be palpated covering the temporal inner sclera. With a successive dissection, a hard, white, 30 x 3 x 1 mm mass was exposed (). It was difficult to distinguish the origin of the mass considering the medical history. We had a histopathological specimen evaluation done, which described an ossified structure with areas of thin retinal tissue attached that could be a posttraumatic ossification.", "age": "[[31.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16527774': 1, '12355691': 1, '33422139': 1, '9559746': 1, '2127065': 1, '24322043': 1, '2409500': 1, '4981081': 1, '9006438': 1, '6113492': 1, '15965172': 1, '29450374': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
