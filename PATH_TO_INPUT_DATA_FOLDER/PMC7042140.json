Later this infant was diagnosed with left ventricle tumour by colour Doppler echocardiography and computed tomographic angiography (). Based on imaging measurements, the tumour was large relative to left ventricle. In order to better reveal the adjacent relationship between tumour and surrounding tissues, we used 3D printing to restore the heart of this infant. The heart model showed a 27 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 25 mm mass that originated from the anterior and lateral wall of the left ventricle, occupying 80% of cavity volume of the left ventricular obstructing mitral valve inflow ().\\nIn view of the extensive adhesions of the base of the tumour to the anterior wall and side wall of left ventricle, as well as its proximity to the mitral valve, chordae tendineae, and other important anatomical structures, the orthotopic cardiac tumour resection would be difficult and risky; therefore, we adopted the technology of heart autotransplantation. The surgical procedure was briefly described as follows: open a median sternotomy incision, institute cardiopulmonary bypass, isolate the heart, remove the tumour, and return the heart to its original position (). Histology revealed rhabdomyoma (). The afflicted child left hospital 13 days thereafter and no tumour recurrence or arrhythmia in 5 months of follow-up.", "age": "[[2.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23312105': 1, '24717305': 1, '27549550': 1, '12075865': 1, '32123797': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
