She was transferred to our emergency department and her only symptom was bilateral lateral knee pain mostly during weight-bearing. Clinical examination showed bilateral lateral knee tenderness with erosions and mild effusions at the front of both knees. Knee instability was not found at both knees. There were no nerve dysfunctions or other concomitant injuries. The radiographic control showed bilateral fibular head fractures (). We performed a CT scan of both knees to evaluate the displacement of the bone fragments (). The lateral sides of fibular heads were avulsed, but the displacement was less than 3 mm at both sites. An MRI examination excluded ligamentous injuries and showed bone bruises at the medial femoral condyle of both knees (Figures and ). The patient was treated conservatively with functional knee braces for 6 weeks allowing full range of motion. Since medial femoral condyle bruises were mild and without any symptoms, full weight-bearing was permitted. Functional knee braces were used in order to eliminate the lateral knee patient during weight-bearing, although instability was not apparent. Six weeks after the trauma, there were no symptoms while the fractures sites had united completely after 6 months (). One year postinjury the patient was free from symptoms.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'7068696': 1, '7223919': 1, '10750995': 1, '10336196': 1, '3805084': 1, '8550153': 1, '17387454': 1, '9240976': 1, '11856678': 1, '12540438': 1, '32733728': 2, '20811573': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7378631-1': 1}"}
