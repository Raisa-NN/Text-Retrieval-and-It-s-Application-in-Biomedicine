In anamnesis only a history of heavy smoker (20 pack-year) was reported.\\nChest X-ray showed signs of congestion with redistribution of pulmonary blood flow (not shown).\\nThe patient was treated with O2 therapy, diuretics, and antihypertensive drugs obtaining only slight improvement so she was hospitalized.\\nWe performed a preliminary precontrast CT (16-slice Multidetector CT, GE Medical Systems), which identified an intraluminal tracheal lesion of 13 mm, characterised by low density (36 HU), which occupied half diameter of tracheal lumen. The mass had smooth and well-defined border without signs of infiltration. Multiphase study showed elevated contrast enhancement in arterial phase and a modest release of contrast in venous phase (arterial phase: 120 HU; venous phase: 100 HU); this behaviour reflects the rich vascularity of this kind of tumor (Figures , , , and ).\\nTo assess the histology of the lesion, a biopsy was made during bronchoscopy (). The biopsy specimen was consistent with benign granular cell tumor.\\nThe patient received endobronchial therapy (electrosurgery) and the clinical symptoms resolved. The follow-up CT did not show recurrence of disease.", "age": "[[64.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17646466': 1, '32015959': 1, '31720208': 2, '19168836': 1, '17616025': 1, '14710011': 1, '21377110': 1, '15680798': 1, '22754824': 1, '21881384': 1, '31719987': 1, '18082899': 1, '10187970': 1, '2998706': 1, '17923776': 1, '15671395': 1, '14502147': 1, '25548708': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6838894-1': 1}"}
