Initial mammography and ultrasonography of the breast were inconclusive. Her past medical history was significant for vaginal hysterectomy at 45 years of age and back surgery at 68 years of age for degenerative spine disease. Family history was negative for breast cancer but her father had colon cancer. She was a non-smoker and did not consume alcohol. Three weeks later examination showed no change in size but increased tenderness. However, no erythema, ecchymosis, skin ulceration or dimpling was seen. An excisional biopsy showed ACC. She subsequently underwent a modified radical mastectomy with axillary node dissection.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'14659359': 1, '4312026': 1, '19031084': 1, '21790841': 1, '12001107': 1, '2824330': 1, '4319210': 1, '34411836': 1, '27278481': 1, '3030200': 1, '171285': 1, '32256670': 1, '2549491': 1, '8989549': 1, '8390344': 1, '193456': 1, '12095593': 1, '24520228': 2, '1311551': 1, '20653964': 1, '4323423': 1, '28008158': 1, '30189404': 1, '4309694': 1, '26843221': 1, '16813652': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3918532-1': 1, '3918532-2': 1, '3918532-3': 1, '3918532-4': 1, '3918532-5': 1}"}
