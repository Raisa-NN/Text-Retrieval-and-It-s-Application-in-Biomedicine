We considered mucoepidermoid carcinoma as our main differential diagnosis.\\nAll neoplasms were completely excised by surgeons through an intraoral approach under general anesthesia. There was no communication between the neoplasms and nerve bundles. Gross examinations showed three separated oval encapsulated masses with smooth surface. The biggest tumor was 4 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm, and the smallest was 2.2 cm \u00d7 1.8 cm \u00d7 1.3 cm. The sectioned surface was grayish-white in color and cystic-solid lesion with moderate hardness (Figure ). Microscopic examination showed a lesion composed of bland spindle cells and demonstrated typical Antoni A and Antoni B areas with scattered pseudoglandular and microcystic foci. These pseudoglandular and microcystic areas were lined by flat to cuboidal cells (Figure ). Some cystic areas showed hemorrhage. There were some hyalinized blood vessels elsewhere. No mitotic figure was found in tumor cells. The tumor cells and lining cells were positive for the S-100 protein and negative for Ckp protein by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining (Figure ).\\nComputed tomography showed three low-density oval neoplasms under the tongue, which were cystic-solid lesion and unclear boundary (Figure ). Magnetic resonance imaging scan showed no evidence of vestibular schwannoma.\\nThe timeline of case reports is shown in Table .", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25793198': 1, '6432304': 1, '12752143': 1, '26844614': 1, '26269328': 1, '25087791': 1, '23834304': 1, '16534111': 1, '21478728': 1, '3354508': 1, '16148415': 1, '17176020': 1, '6692256': 1, '9699832': 1, '16119981': 1, '8951498': 1, '26626208': 1, '16762020': 1, '33344551': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
