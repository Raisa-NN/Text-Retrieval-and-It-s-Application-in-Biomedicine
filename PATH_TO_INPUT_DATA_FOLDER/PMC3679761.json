She had previously experienced several weeks of generalized weakness, malaise, temporal headache, and left palpebral ptosis, without a recording of her temperature. She did not mention any episodes of jaw claudication or scalp tenderness. Her medical history was significant for arterial hypertension, cholecystectomy, and a cataract operation in the right eye.\\nOn examination, reduced power was noted in her left arm and leg with normal speech and no facial droop. The left palpebral ptosis was noted which upon repeat questioning she insisted to be contained to the left eye lid and did not fluctuate during the day. A low-grade fever was recorded. Physical examination of both temporal arteries showed no abnormalities. Auscultation of the chest revealed a systolic murmur.\\nComputed tomography (CT) of brain performed upon admission revealed ischaemic leukoencephalopathy but no infarcts, whereas the repeat CT showed subacute infarcts in the right posterior parietal and occipital lobes. Ultrasound of carotids showed no significant stenosis, and ECG revealed a sinus rhythm.\\nInitial investigations revealed anemia (normochromatic and normocytic) and moderately elevated transaminases. Our patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 112 mm/h, and her C-reactive protein level (CRP) was 14.4 (normal < 0.5) mg/dL.\\nA lumbar puncture was performed which revealed an absence of cells with normal protein and glucose (the fluid culture that ensued was negative).\\nA transthoracic cardiac ultrasound showed a mild hypertrophy of the left ventrical, an exertion fraction of 60%, and mild mitral valve regurgitation. Vegetations were not observed.\\nA computed tomography of the thorax and upper and lower abdomen was performed which did not reveal any significant findings.\\nThyroid function tests were within normal range. Antinuclear antibody assay was negative, as were antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, rheumatoid factor, PANCA, CANCA, and anti-Jo1. Complement factors C3 and C4 were elevated. Repeated blood and urine cultures were negative. The Mantoux screening test was negative.\\nA gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed which were normal.\\nDue to the low-grade fever which persisted and the elevated inflammatory markers, despite the absence of other signs or symptoms of infection, broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated, as was antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel). The low-grade fever and inflammatory markers persisted despite the antibiotic regime.\\nOn the 10th day of hospitalization and although patient's left arm and leg weaknesses were improving, the unilateral blepharoptosis evolved into bilateral blepharoptosis, and she presented with acute onset dysphagia involving liquids and solids, dysarthria, and proximal muscle weakness. She also mentioned deterioration in her vision, which was objectively confirmed with reduced optical acuity and a limitation in the visual fields (completely in the right eye).\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain confirmed the CT findings without revealing significant additional pathologic features.\\nDue to the reduced optical acuity and the limitation in the visual fields\u2014although the full clinical picture of the patient could not be interpreted by a probable diagnosis of giant cell arteritis\u2014a temporal artery biopsy as well as skin, muscle, and vessel biopsy was performed. Pending biopsy results, we found it prudent to treat the patient with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg) without delay due to the vision deterioration. We also proceeded to an investigation of serum antibodies to muscle acetylcholine receptors (AChR-Ab) as patient's symptoms of blepharoptosis, dysphagia, and proximal muscle weakness were strongly suggestive of myasthenia gravis (MG).\\nHistological examination indeed confirmed giant cell arteritis, while the AChR-Ab were also positive (). The skin muscle vessel biopsy did not reveal any pathology.\\nThe dysphagia, dysarthria, and blepharoptosis showed immediate response to the steroid treatment. Patient's temperature readings returned to normal, and the inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) gradually decreased, until they returned within normal range.\\nUpon the result of AChR-Ab, oral pyridostigmine was added to the patient's treatment (60 mg three times daily).\\nPatient was discharged with high-dose oral steroids (prednisolone 55 mg daily), oral pyridostigmine (60 mg three times daily), and antiplatelet therapy.\\nUpon reexamination in two weeks time, due to a slight deterioration in patient's status (blepharoptosis, dysphagia and dysphagia were exasperated), the pyridostigmine dose was increased (60 mg 4 times daily).\\nFour weeks after she was discharged from our department, the patient presented to the emergency room with dyspnea and palpitations. Upon physical examination, except for tachypnea and tachycardia, an edema of her right leg was noted. ECG showed a sinus tachycardia. She had respiratory alkalosis and elevated D-dimers levels. She underwent a triplex ultrasound which revealed deep vein thrombosis of the right leg, while C/T angiography demonstrated a massive pulmonary embolism. Deep vein thrombosis was probably the result of the limited mobility of the patient due to myasthenia, as the evaluation for thrombophilia was unrevealing.\\nWe continue to reassess the patient monthly in cooperation with our hospital's rheumatologists and neurologists. After the initial two-month-high dose steroid regimen, they will gradually be tapered, depending on the patient's condition.", "age": "[[79.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21669464': 1, '19593228': 1, '15615235': 1, '7793234': 1, '25596711': 1, '16487094': 1, '17986328': 1, '5078894': 1, '7393075': 1, '16867036': 1, '18640460': 1, '22259613': 1, '18059039': 1, '7831174': 1, '17630482': 1, '17415507': 1, '23781375': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
