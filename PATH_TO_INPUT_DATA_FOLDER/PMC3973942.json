He was pointed out with a mediastinal mass by a health checkup. Previous history of the patient was not significant. The result of physical examination was within normal limits. Chest radiography showed a mass on the right lower mediastinum (Fig. ). Chest CT showed a tumor located in the right posterior mediastinum. It was 2.5 cm in diameter beside the T8 and T9 thoracic vertebrae (Fig. ). According to T1 enhanced dual image at (TR165, TE4.8) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the tumor is revealed as high intensity (Fig. a); however, at (TR165, TE2.3) it is revealed as partially low intensity (Fig. b). It suggests that the tumor contains fat component.\\nWe performed a tumor resection under video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The tumor was reddish brown and covered with parietal pleura. It was soft and encapsulated, appearing as hemangioma. The patient was discharged with no complications on the 7th operative day, and thereafter followed up as outpatient. In the macroscopic findings, size of the specimen was 3.0 \u00d7 2.7 \u00d7 2.5 cm, and was well circumscribed and encapsulated. A microscopic examination revealed a predominant mature adipose tissue with hematopoietic tissue (Fig. ). The final diagnosis was mediastinal extra adrenal myelolipoma.", "age": "[[68.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10478553': 1, '15541988': 1, '26358059': 1, '25005140': 2, '5046855': 1, '6713923': 1, '10870588': 1, '9397452': 1, '25276393': 1, '27818957': 2, '10097729': 1, '30273907': 1, '26762224': 2, '23475269': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4712462-1': 1, '4094594-1': 1, '5087982-1': 1}"}
