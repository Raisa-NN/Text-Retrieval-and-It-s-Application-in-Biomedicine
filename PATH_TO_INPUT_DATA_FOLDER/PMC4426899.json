The symptoms progressively worsened, leading to an increased respiratory rate (RR: 80 bpm), respiratory distress (use of accessory respiratory muscles and subcostal and sternal retractions), and tachycardia (150\u2013200 bpm). At pulmonary auscultation, subcrepitant rales were present with no increase of expiratory time.\\nOn PICU admission, he presented SpO2 of 81% on room air (FiO2 0.21) which responded poorly to oxygen administration, leading to the use of high oxygen flow mask (Venturi mask) with an initial FiO2 of 0.6 (SpO2 increases to the maximum of 91%), quickly ascending to FiO2 1.0 (SpO2 of 92\u201394%: SpO2/FiO2 ratio 94).\\nLaboratory work-up revealed venous pH 7.430, pCO2 34.8, HCO3 22.6, and base excess of \u22121,3, microcytic hypocromic anemia, normal leucocyte count (leucocyte 6000/mm3, neutrophils 44.2%, and lymphocytes 41.7%), and a reactive protein C of 15 mg/dL. Respiratory secretions rapid immunological test identified RSV infection.\\nThoracic X-ray () evaluation identified multiple hypotransparent foci, mainly at the upper right lobe, affecting three quadrants out of four, leading to the presumptive diagnosis of bronchopneumonia.\\nSpO2/FiO2 index was calculated, minimum of 94 (prior to NIV-CPAP implementation).", "age": "[[5.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9094725': 1, '20153708': 1, '18982307': 1, '9700176': 1, '21983628': 1, '22202709': 1, '17133177': 1, '16738493': 1, '11810114': 1, '10634340': 1, '22797452': 1, '21122173': 1, '22802994': 1, '23532315': 1, '17573487': 1, '26000189': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
