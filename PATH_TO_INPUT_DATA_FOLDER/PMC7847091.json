It was occurring more upon awakening and often occurred in multiple clusters with increased frequency over the previous 1 month. Clinical assessment revealed global developmental delay with a developmental age of 2\u20133 months. General examination revealed subtle facial dysmorphism. Epileptic flexor spasms were witnessed on examination. Vision and hearing were intact. Central nervous system examination showed mild central hypotonia with preserved reflexes. EEG showed features of classic hypsarrhythmia. Thus, a clinical diagnosis of West syndrome was made. However, the presence of typical molar tooth sign of midbrain [], prominent cerebellar folia, small cerebellar vermis [], and a prominent fourth ventricle on neuroimaging was diagnostic of JS. He was managed as per West syndrome protocol with prednisolone and valproate with which his spasms subsided, and there was gradual improvement in development. Repeat EEG showed a complete remission of the hypsarrhythmia. As the neuroimaging was diagnostic of JS and clinical condition was mimicking West syndrome, genetic analysis was performed. Clinical exome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous mutation involving exon 4 (c.1192C>T)(p.Arg398Trp) and exon 5 (c.272C>T)(p.pro91Leu) in the ZNF423 gene consistent with JS type 19.", "age": "[[8.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'5816874': 1, '23956573': 1, '28799313': 1, '26002775': 1, '22863007': 1, '1341417': 1, '17377524': 1, '19129991': 1, '20019935': 1, '10488904': 1, '33531950': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
