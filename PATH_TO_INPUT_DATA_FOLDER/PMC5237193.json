Four weeks after the cast was removed, she continued to complain of elbow pain, and had decreased movements of the elbow. Despite intensive physiotherapy, the pain has continued and the movements of the elbow further decreased. At presentation, the left elbow was effused, tender, warm, and had significant flexure contracture. ANA was positive at 1:160, RF and anti-CCP antibodies were negative. PPD testing was negative. X-ray of the left elbow showed joint space narrowing and atrophy of the elbow\u2019s articulation. CT of the left elbow demonstrated subchondral bone erosions, bone overgrowth and accelerated trochlear ossification (see Fig. ). The MRI revealed a small elbow effusion, marked synovial thickening, post-gadolinium enhancement of the radial head, trochlea, olecranon and coronoid bones, ballooning of the humeral epiphysis and multiple articular erosions. The child was started on naproxen, and the elbow joint was injected with triamcinolone hexacetonide. She also commenced intensive physiotherapy, including dynamic stretching and splinting. After 3 months, she was able to almost completely strengthen the elbow. A repeat MRI with gadolinium of left elbow is scheduled this month.", "age": "[[9.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15485021': 1, '22842302': 1, '26802181': 1, '25023756': 1, '14969057': 1, '12384930': 1, '8989803': 1, '2181618': 1, '21109520': 1, '30612148': 1, '27407238': 1, '25119829': 1, '14760812': 1, '28086918': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5237193-1': 2, '5237193-2': 2, '5237193-3': 2}"}
