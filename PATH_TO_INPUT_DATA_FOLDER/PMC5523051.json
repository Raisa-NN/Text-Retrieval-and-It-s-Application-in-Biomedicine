She did not feel any masses in the perineal area. Genital examination was performed. Inspection was normal and palpation revealed bilateral firm, fix, and non-tender masses in vestibular gland region. We performed a 1-2 cm incision just about the bulged point of the masses, excised masses from adjacent tissue and totally removed both masses and did marsupialization. Grossly, the specimen consisted of well-delineated creamy grayish mass with elastic consistency measuring 4\u00d73\u00d72.5 cm and 4.5\u00d71.7\u00d71.7 cm (). The cut section revealed a homogenous grayish solid surface and the representative section submitted in 4 blocks. No necrosis or hemorrhage was seen. Microscopic examination showed hyperplastic and hypertrophied Bartholin\u2019s gland revealing mild edema, chronic inflammatory infiltrate, and focal dilation of ducts with squamous metaplasia (). The diagnosis was hyperplasic and hypertrophied Bartholin\u2019s gland with chronic adenitis. There was no evidence of malignancy.", "age": "[[37.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11770602': 1, '17671387': 1, '26195958': 1, '16753743': 1, '24225038': 1, '25068065': 2, '17667173': 1, '9785128': 1, '28761210': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4102998-1': 1}"}
