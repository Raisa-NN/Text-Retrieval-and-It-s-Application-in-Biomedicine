She aspirated the pin while securing her scarf and holding the pin in the mouth. She was hemodynamically stable, and the systemic examination was unremarkable. Initial chest x-ray showed a sharp radiopaque object in the left bronchus piercing the lung parenchyma. Computed tomography (CT) chest was performed as requested by the thoracic surgeon for possible thoracotomy in case the bronchoscopy failed to remove the pin. CT chest confirmed the finding of x-ray chest [].\\nAn ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeon failed to remove the pin by rigid bronchoscopy. A pediatric pulmonologist successfully removed the pin using flexible bronchoscopy, by bending the pin with forceps [Figures and ]. The repeat x-ray chest after the procedure was absolutely normal. The child did not have any complications after the procedure and was discharged home.", "age": "[[11.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23347798': 1, '32108599': 1, '27407945': 1, '22017951': 1, '12122719': 1, '20863973': 1, '31548955': 1, '11283834': 1, '19878803': 1, '17224190': 1, '17215569': 1, '25157007': 1, '16755451': 1, '27578937': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
