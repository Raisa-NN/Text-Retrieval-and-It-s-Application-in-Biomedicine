VA of the left eye was 6/200, complicated by a chronic dense nuclear sclerosis. Fundus examination revealed diffuse retinal whitening around the posterior pole (A) consistent with a CRAO. En face structural OCT images of the middle retina from the 12 \u00d7 12 mm scan demonstrated the peri-venular fern-like pattern of PAMM (B) confirmed by the retinal vascular map (C). FA did not show any transit delays or nonperfusion (D). On closer examination using the en face structural OCT image and B-scan from the 6 \u00d7 6 scan, the junction between ischemic and non-ischemic retina could be appreciated (E\u2013F). At the one-month follow-up visit, the VA was 20/70 with a potential acuity meter measurement of 20/40. Examination showed resolution of the retinal whitening and en face OCT images showed significant improvement of the peri-venular fern-like PAMM with residual inner nuclear layer thinning (G\u2013I).", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'32783959': 1, '29176528': 1, '26386158': 1, '27668500': 1, '25849522': 1, '30081014': 1, '24794089': 1, '24240565': 1, '26113210': 1, '26355822': 1, '23929382': 1, '28237415': 1, '33763621': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7973291-1': 2, '7973291-2': 2}"}
