Our routine method of epidural injection is to take 80 mg of methylprednisolone and 2 ml of 2% lignocaine in 20 ml of syringe and to dilute it up to 20 ml using 0.9% NS. After aseptic preparation of the local site, the previously prepared solution was injected into the sacral hiatus using a 22-gauge needle. Immediately after injection, the patient started complaining of severe pain in both the lower limbs. Pain was associated with pruritus, severe cramps, and profuse sweating. Approximately over a period of 5 min, he developed progressive weakness of both the lower limbs. On further clinical examination, the patient had complete flaccid paraplegia below T11 level. Below T11, all the reflexes were absent. On further examination, his blood pressure was recorded as 210/110 mmHg and heart rate was 124 beats per minute.\\nThe patient was shifted to medicine emergency immediately. For high blood pressure, labetalol was given immediately; however, patient's blood pressure was refractory to the treatment. Sweating and agitation continued. Electrocardiography showed features suggestive of hyperkalemia such as tachycardia, absent P-wave, and tall T-wave. We reviewed the medication administered and found that instead of NS, 15% KCl was used as diluents by a junior assistant by mistake. The patient was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit. All supportive measures were given. In addition to supportive measures, membrane stabilizing agent calcium gluconate was used. Blood samples showed normal studies, except raised potassium levels (7 mg/dL). Potassium chelating agent (Ksylate) was used to decrease potassium concentration in the blood. After 2 h of treatment, blood pressure and heart rate returned to normal levels. Return of sensory modalities occurred after 6 h, and by that time, the patient had developed spasticity. There was exaggeration of deep tendon reflexes and extensor plantar reflex. The patient became neurologically normal in the next 2 h. The patient was discharged the following day from the Intensive Care Unit.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'3740512': 1, '19165299': 1, '3970337': 1, '23598728': 1, '2974323': 1, '9570615': 1, '21562412': 1, '8738699': 1, '8607325': 1, '27891040': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
