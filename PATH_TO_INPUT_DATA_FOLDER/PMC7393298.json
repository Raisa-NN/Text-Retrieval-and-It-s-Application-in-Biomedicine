His memory began to decline at the age of 71 years and further deteriorated thereafter. After the clinical diagnosis was determined, the patient was prescribed an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. At the age of 73 years, he had trouble writing and finding his way home. He also had difficulty remembering words and names, and his orientation to time worsened. He further demonstrated impairment in daily living activities by failing to pay after eating at a restaurant and by experiencing difficulties with hygiene management. At this time, he recorded a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 20 (patient's score/maximum score): temporal orientation (4/5), spatial orientation (3/5), registration (3/3), attention and calculation (2/5), remote memory (1/3), language (7/8), and copy the diagram (0/1). No family history of dementia or other neurologic diseases was reported. Axial brain computed tomography images revealed mild atrophy in the bilateral medial temporal and frontal lobes, probably meeting the criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD) (). His cognition continued to deteriorate rapidly: MMSE scores of 17 at 74, 13 at 76, 5 at 77, 4 at 80, and 0 at 82 years of age. The patient died of aggravated pneumonia at the age of 82 years. Written informed consent was obtained from a legal surrogate of the patient.\\nThe major pathological findings of his autopsy were suggestive AD. Grossly, atrophy was severe in the neocortex and hippocampus (). Microscopically, neuronal loss and gliosis were severe in the hippocampus and moderate in the neocortex and amygdala (). Superficial microvacuolation in cortical layer II was present in the inferior temporal area (). Neurofibrillary tangles were frequent in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and neocortex (). Neuritic plaques were frequent in the neocortex. Amyloid deposition extended up to CA4 of the hippocampus. Based on scores of A3 (Thal amyloid phase 4), B3 (Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage VI), and C3 [Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuritic plaque score frequent], the pathological findings were compatible with high ADNC. \u03b1-Synuclein immunostaining revealed multiple Lewy bodies in the amygdala, but none in the midbrain or cingulate (), consistent with amygdala-predominant Lewy body disease (LBD). Immunohistochemistry for TDP-43 revealed neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (). Abundant NCIs and some glial cytoplasmic inclusions were observed in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, subiculum, and inferior temporal cortex (). NCIs were sparsely present in the insula (). The frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and midbrain lacked TDP-43-positive inclusions. The TDP-43 pathology of the case indicated LATE-NC stage 2.", "age": "[[82.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31243453': 1, '29716643': 1, '21514250': 1, '21607722': 1, '31039256': 1, '17469117': 1, '28792154': 1, '30784812': 1, '26810071': 1, '26091809': 1, '17023659': 1, '22043314': 1, '32734738': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
