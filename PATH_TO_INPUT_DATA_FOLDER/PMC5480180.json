On admission, the results of her neurological examination were normal. Her physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. A CT scan depicted a large, single pelvic mass with inhomogeneous signal intensity (164\u00d7113\u00d7146 mm) and ascites. A laboratory examination did not reveal an elevated level of CA-125 (11 U/ml) tumor marker. She underwent laparotomy and the entire tumor was removed. The pathologic diagnosis was GCT. No further treatment was given. On clinical and radiological examination 11 months later, she was found to be free of the disease. After the OP, during the oncological follow-up, six 24-hour urinary samples were collected at different time points. Her urinary concentrations (\u03bcg/24 hours) of An, Et, DHEA, 11-OH-An, 16-OH-DHEA, PD, PT, \u03945-PD, \u03945-AT, THS, 11-O-PT, THE, THA, THB, aTHB, THF, aTHF, \u03b1-CL, \u03b2-CL, and \u03b1-C were determined by GC-MS/SIM. All components were detected in all samples. The interventions and treatments of patient 2, the collection of urine samples, and the levels of the urinary steroid metabolites are shown in Fig. .", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'6254695': 1, '17617526': 1, '6465418': 1, '32724409': 1, '7250754': 1, '17945423': 1, '12637488': 1, '1109770': 1, '28637499': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5480180-1': 2}"}
