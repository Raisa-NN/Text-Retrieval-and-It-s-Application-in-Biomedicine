He was under a physiotherapy programme for his quadriparesis. He had been diagnosed with autonomic dysreflexia due to the hypertensive attacks which were followed with hypotension and bradicardia. His neurogenic bladder was initially managed with an indwelling foley catheter and then clean intermittent catheterisation for two years. Because of persistant attacks, suprapubic catheterization with cystofix has been performed one year ago. The patient admited to our emergency department with letargy, left sided facial paresis and worsening in his paresis in the left upper extremity. His family described the history of cystofix dysfunction with abdominal distention and increasing in blood pressure up to 220/100 mm Hg right before these symptoms. His cranial CT revealed right thalamic and inraventricular hematoma with 21 mm3 in volume (). He has been followed-up with medical treatment and his cystofix catheter had been replaced with a wider one. Afterward, there were no additional AD attackd. He became alert and his nascent motor defisit on his upper extremity improved completely.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1598177': 1, '20697419': 1, '20613698': 1, '15759250': 1, '31456068': 1, '28751978': 1, '21187714': 1, '14581313': 1, '16198705': 1, '17525555': 1, '16987460': 1, '26507254': 1, '15811886': 1, '23006876': 1, '16010281': 1, '11859441': 1, '20186562': 1, '18427565': 1, '25132935': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
