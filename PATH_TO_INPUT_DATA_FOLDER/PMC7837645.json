Rapid antigen test for COVID-19 was positive. He was admitted to the hospital on day 1, and symptomatic treatment was given for high fever (101\u00b0F). Remdisivir was given on day 2 (200 mg) and day 3 (100 mg). The patient was also started on methylprednisolone 40 mg twice daily from day 2. His fever improved promptly and bradycardia was seen. On day 9, his fever spiked again. His methylprednisolone dose was increased to 125 mg twice a day. Remdisivir was also restarted and received two doses (days 9 and 10). As the patient was still symptomatic (hypoxia and fever) and there was a rapid increase in CRP levels, methylprednisolone dose was increased to 250 mg twice a day on day 12. Methylprednisolone was tapered gradually to 64 mg per day on day 23. As his clinical condition improved significantly, the patient was discharged home on day 24. His CRP levels came to normal in a few days.
