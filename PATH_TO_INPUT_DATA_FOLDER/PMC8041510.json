Diplopia was not observed and eye movement was in the normal range. MRI and angiography reveal dural type indirect carotid cavernous fistula (CCF). Preoperative T2-weighted axial MRI shows the signal voiding on right CS and preoperative MR source image shows abnormal signal flow on right CS (). Transvenous embolization was taken with multiple coils (Tornado\u00ae Embolization Microcoil\u2122, Cook Incorporated, Bloomington, IN, USA, Tornado 5/2\u00d710, Tornado 4/2\u00d79, total 19). She also was discharged without any focal neurologic deficits. After 38 months, she complained of sudden diplopia. The neurological assessment showed restriction in abduction of the right eye (Abducens nerve impairment). Laboratory tests showed normal limits. Postoperative T2-weighted axial MRI shows some mixed signal intensity lesion around CS and prepontine/superior cerebellopontine cistern, suggesting inflammatory reaction or thrombosis (, C, arrow). But no abnormalities were observed in the hematological examination of the patients. And postoperative MR source image reveals complete obliteration of CCF. After steroid pulse therapy, the diplopia much improved. This cranial nerve palsy may be stabilized with the administration of corticosteroid. Although we could not check follow up MRI, we think the cause of this cranial nerve palsy is inflammatory reaction around the CS.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9933290': 1, '28837440': 1, '12008697': 1, '24190456': 1, '17110671': 1, '14519216': 1, '18812958': 1, '17998416': 1, '18671631': 1, '11844274': 1, '33494557': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8041510-1': 2}"}
