He was admitted to the general ward at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. Two weeks before admission, he had experienced left thigh swelling after falling from a bed at a private rehabilitation center. Radiologic examination at the emergency department revealed a left femur shaft fracture. Two days later, he underwent orthopedic surgery for the femur fracture. He was discharged from the hospital without any complications seven days after surgery.\u2028Two days before the present admission, he suddenly began to have poor oral intake. The patient refused to eat solid foods. He only took in liquids. His body temperature was elevated to 38.0\u00b0C. One day before admission, bilious vomiting developed and the patient became lethargic. In addition, his urine output decreased. It became dark in appearance. As gastrointestinal symptoms persisted with features of dehydration, he was admitted to the general ward for supportive care and further evaluation of the bilious vomiting.\\nAs the patient was an abandoned child residing in a private rehabilitation center, his perinatal history or family history was unknown. His past medical history in infancy was unclear either. He was initially diagnosed with cerebral palsy of unknown cause. Given his pain insensitivity with anhidrosis, he was later diagnosed with HSAN-IV at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. He had suffered from recurrent orthopedic diseases such as femur fractures, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis approximately 1\u20132 times per year. His fingertips were mutilated because of recurrent cellulitis and septic arthritis of fingers. He had recurrent trauma history due to an impulse control disorder and pain insensitivity as well as poor hygienic condition. His body temperature was unstable. It tended to change dramatically, ranging from abnormally low body temperature to high fevers along with unstable blood pressures indicative of autonomic dysregulation. He had been treated for severe dry skin, hyperkeratosis, fissuring, and xerotic eczema with topical ointments. He was wheelchair-bound and mentally retarded, although verbal communication with social workers was partially possible. During long-term follow-up at the Pediatric Nephrology Clinic of the same hospital, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia were also detected, leading to suspicion of Gitelman syndrome. With regard to medications, he was taking anti-psychotics, psychostimulants, and spironolactone.\\nOn physical examination, he was alert but cachectic. He was wearing a hip spica cast for the femur fracture. His height was 134 cm (<3rd percentile). His body weight was 29.1 kg (<3rd percentile). He had blood pressure of 130/88 mmHg, pulse rate of 97 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 21 times/minute, and body temperature of 37.3\u00b0C initially. Neither conjunctiva was anemic. Neither sclera was icteric. His lips and mucous membranes were slightly dehydrated. Both tympanic membranes were intact. His cervical lymph nodes were not palpable. The chest wall expanded symmetrically without retraction. Breath sounds were clear without crackles or wheezing. His heartbeat was regular without murmur. His abdomen was soft and flat. There was no tenderness or rebound tenderness in the abdomen. Bowel sounds were hyperactive. There was no shifting dullness on percussion. His liver or spleen was not palpable. There was no peripheral edema, digital clubbing, or cyanosis. However, all fingertips were mutilated (). His skin was dry. There was no rash or petechia.\\nOn the day of admission, laboratory tests were done with the following results: sodium, 138 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; aspartate transaminase (AST), 23 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 12 IU/L; total bilirubin, 1.0 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 29 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.41 mg/dL; C-reactive protein (CRP) <0.03 mg/dL; and serum magnesium, 1.6 mg/dL. Supportive treatment was started to correct his dehydration and he was maintained in stable condition.\\nOn the third day of hospitalization, a high fever developed suddenly and his temperature rose to 41.8\u00b0C. He had no response to antipyretic drugs. At the same time, his blood pressure suddenly dropped to 50/17 mmHg. He also had seizure-like movements, including upward eyeball deviation, loss of consciousness, and generalized clonic movement. Both pupils became fixed at 2 mm diameter. Results of laboratory tests were as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count of 19.4\u00d7103/\u00b5L, hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 90\u00d7103/\u00b5L, sodium level of 137 mmol/L, potassium level of 2.6 mmol/L, AST level of 454 IU/L, ALT level of 258 IU/L, total bilirubin level of 4.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin level of 2.6 mg/dL, amylase level of 228 IU/L, lipase level of 888 IU/L, creatinine phosphate kinase level of 1,258 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase level of 985 IU/L, BUN level of 49 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.62 mg/dL, and CRP level of 0.6 mg/dL. These results indicated acute liver failure, acute pancreatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury. Additional testing for anemia revealed plasma hemoglobin level of 27.5 mg/dL, serum ferritin level of 250 ng/mL, and weakly positive antinuclear antibody (1:40).\\nRepeated blood testing results on the same day revealed markedly worsened results as follows: AST, 492 IU/L; ALT, 545 IU/L; total bilirubin, 10.8 mg/dL; direct bilirubin, 5.1 mg/dL; amylase, 520 IU/L; lipase, 5,071 IU/L; prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT INR), 3.1; activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 52.7 seconds; fibrinogen, 160 mg/dL; D-dimer, 17.62 \u00b5g/mL; alkaline phosphatase, 126 IU/L; and \u03b3-glutamyltranspeptidase, 98 IU/L. Aggressive management was performed, including fluid resuscitation, intravenous inotropes (dopamine and norepinephrine), antibiotics, and gabexatemesilate. He was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and ventilator care was applied. In the PICU, he developed seizure-like movements. Lorazepam was injected once and mannitol was started to reduce intracranial pressure. Abdominal computed tomography revealed no definite radiological evidence of acute pancreatitis. However, multiple filling defects were noted in both kidneys. Findings of brain magnetic resonance imaging suggested hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.\\nFurther investigation of the etiology of fulminant hepatitis revealed a low serum level of ceruloplasmin (5.5 mg/dL) and increased 24-hour urine copper level (1,028 \u00b5g/dL). Liver biopsy was done under the suspicion of Wilson's disease. Liver pathology revealed centrilobular confluent necrosis with marked copper deposition in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells with extensive lobular disarray (). Liver copper deposit was 74 \u00b5g/g dry weight (reference range 10\u201335 \u00b5g/g). Ophthalmologic examination was negative for Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings.\\nTo confirm the diagnosis of suspected underlying genetic diseases based on his past medical history and present manifestations, gene studies for HSAN-IV, Gitelman syndrome, and Wilson disease were performed. HSAN-IV was confirmed based on results of NTRK1 gene sequencing for HSAN-IV which revealed c.2002G>T, p.Asp668Tyr heterozygote (American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics /Association for Molecular Pathology [ACMG/AMP] classification: pathogenic) and c.360-1G>A, (IVS3) heterozygote (ACMG/AMP classification: pathogenic), indicating a compound heterozygote mutation causing autosomal recessive disease (). In addition, SLC12A3 gene sequencing for Gitelman syndrome revealed a heterozygote c.1216A>C in exon 10 [p.Asn(AAT)406His(CAT)] (). However, ATP7B gene sequencing for Wilson disease showed negative results despite clinical manifestations, laboratory and liver pathologic findings, and a clinical course compatible with the diagnosis of this disease.\\nAfter initiating treatment with trientine (triethylenetetramine) 25 mg/kg/day via nasogastric tube as well as a low copper diet, clinical symptoms and laboratory findings began to improve markedly. Laboratory tests results on the 15th day in the hospital were as follows: WBC count of 8.66\u00d7103/\u00b5L, hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/dL, platelet count of 364\u00d7103/\u00b5L, sodium level of 137 mmol/L, potassium level of 4.0 mmol/L, AST level of 128 IU/L, ALT level of 127 IU/L, total bilirubin level of 1.3 mg/dL, BUN level of 25 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.1 mg/dL, PT INR of 1.15, and aPTT of 52.3 seconds.\\nAs the patient did not recover from brain damage caused by high fever and shock and his ability to breathe independently was not restored during hospitalization, he received a tracheostomy for long-term mechanical ventilator care and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for enteral feeding. In a bed-ridden state on home ventilator care and gastrostomy feeding, trientine treatment and copper restriction diet were maintained without any problem after discharge from the hospital or during long-term follow-up at the outpatient clinic.\\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (IRB no. B-1703-387-701).
