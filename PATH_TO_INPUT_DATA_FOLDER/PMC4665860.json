She had a history of thyroidectomy for Graves\u2019s disease about 3 years before, and according to documentation she was rather erratic in taking her methimazole tablets, that was one of the reasons to proceed with thyroid surgery. She also had a history of cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis and was waiting for appointment with gastroenterologists because of abnormal liver function tests (Table ). She was taking Calcium and vitamin D preparations for osteoporosis prophylaxis. She denied excessive alcohol consumption. Two doses of 1000 \u03bcg of L-T4 were administered within 48 h without any adverse effects. This was followed by marked improvement of her well-being, as well as her thyroid function tests results (Table ). She was told that it was essential to take her L-T4 tablets at least 60 min before breakfast (that she had not done before). Two months post discharge she had a low-normal FT4 [0.97 ng/dl (referenced range 0.93\u20131.70)] and slightly raised TSH [12.06 mIU/l (reference range 0.27\u20134.20)]. She did not turn up for her follow-up appointment scheduled 1 week after her blood test.", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'6766947': 1, '32071898': 1, '23574614': 1, '32467734': 2, '9062499': 1, '1431571': 1, '12406989': 1, '834138': 1, '33876304': 1, '21595516': 1, '23158186': 1, '30349610': 1, '8435884': 1, '15853819': 1, '30867970': 2, '19584184': 1, '23554450': 1, '24610609': 1, '26628920': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4665860-1': 2, '4665860-2': 2, '6379869-1': 1, '7236172-1': 1}"}
