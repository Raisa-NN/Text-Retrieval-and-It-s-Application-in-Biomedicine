He gradually experienced generalized abdominal pain that localized to the right iliac fossa (RIF) after several hours. This was associated with a few episodes of nausea and vomiting. On examination, he was febrile with local tenderness in the RIF.\\nCT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with administration of oral and intravenous (IV) contrast. The scout images showed a well-defined high-density structure in the right iliac fossa (Figure ). The appendix was markedly dilated measuring 1.6 centimeters (cm) in thickness with peri-appendiceal fat stranding, and mucosal enhancement. There was reactive adenopathy in the right lower abdomen as well (Figure ). A large well defined 0.6 cm metallic density was beyond the appendiceal orifice. Unlike typical appendicoliths, this was round man made, looking like a BB bullet (Figure ). There were no signs of perforation or abscess formation. Upon further questioning, the patient reported accidentally ingesting an air gun BB bullet one month back. The patient underwent an emergent laparoscopic appendectomy without any intra-operative complications. The appendectomy specimen revealed the lodged within the appendix BB bullet. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home a few days later.", "age": "[[19.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23805364': 1, '30392606': 1, '16037513': 1, '21430847': 2, '12740473': 1, '22347538': 1, '24347220': 1, '11577935': 1, '27826565': 1, '34462677': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3047773-1': 1}"}
