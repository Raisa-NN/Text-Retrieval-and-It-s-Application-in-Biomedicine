He was lethargic and unable to walk on his own. The initial neurological examination showed an impaired direct/indirect light reflex of the right eye and a right third nerve palsy, accompanied by anisocoria and ptosis. His motor power was grade II on the left side. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain showed an enlarged pituitary fossa containing a hemorrhagic pituitary tumor (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a nodular mass, approximately 3\u00d72\u00d73 cm in size, located in the sella and suprasellar portion, accompanied by compression of the optic chiasm (). The mass compressed the bilateral cavernous sinuses, resulting in the obliteration of the cavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery (). A border zone infarct in the right fronto-parietal region was also found ().\\nThe patient was initially treated with fluid replacement and steroids. Although the patient's level of consciousness improved during the next 24 hr, the focal neurological signs persisted. Transsphenoidal tumor decompression was performed within four days of symptom onset. The patient's vision improved immediately after the decompression, but the left hemiplegia persisted.\\nPathological examination revealed an almost completely infarcted pituitary adenoma (). A conventional cerebral angiography performed one week after the operation and MR angiography demonstrated the restoration of flow within the right internal carotid artery (). His left side motor power improved to grade IV+ within six months after the operation.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'7754859': 1, '903813': 1, '4354220': 1, '3816071': 1, '14908656': 1, '25288861': 1, '11447445': 1, '28658829': 1, '26425379': 2, '6635929': 1, '25810933': 2, '24965694': 1, '16488532': 1, '30459913': 2, '32494388': 2, '15531524': 1, '15600283': 1, '23612931': 1, '6664402': 1, '1699153': 1, '22399870': 1, '6879408': 1, '6431060': 1, '3808276': 1, '31748928': 1, '6834127': 1, '19119461': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7265385-1': 1, '6208222-1': 1, '6208222-2': 1, '4575713-1': 1, '4355814-1': 1}"}
