Sitagliptin was added as 3rd line agent, leading to significant fructosamine reduction from 354\u03bcmol/L to 258\u03bcmol/L (equivalent reduction in HbA1c of 1.9%) and weight loss of 6 kg over 6 months.\\nOverall, four out of the five patients were responders to sitagliptin therapy, as evidenced by a significant reduction in fructosamine in two patients by 77 and 96\u03bcmol/L (equivalent reduction in HbA1c of 1.5 and 1.9%). In the other two patients, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of hypoglycaemia with relatively stable glycaemic control. In one case sitagliptin did not result in glucose lowering and was appropriately stopped after 6 months. No patients exhibited signs/symptoms of pancreatitis or cholecystitis, while liver function tests did not change significantly after sitagliptin initiation. In total, no significant side effects were reported.\\nAs seen in , there was no relationship between fructosamine and ferritin levels which could explain changes in glycaemic control.", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26936090': 1, '25325279': 1, '23019309': 1, '26124906': 1, '18425967': 1, '32900588': 1, '26597596': 1, '17300595': 1, '22519906': 1, '25630605': 1, '25538310': 1, '17622601': 1, '20456211': 1, '26173919': 1, '11353881': 1, '27478902': 1, '24571751': 1, '27076180': 1, '26417956': 1, '28101310': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5224814-1': 2, '5224814-2': 2, '5224814-3': 2, '5224814-4': 2}"}
