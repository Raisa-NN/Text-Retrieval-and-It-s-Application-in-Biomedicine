She was mentally alert and her heart rate was slightly elevated at 110/min. The other vital signs were normal. Respiratory sounds were diminished over her left lung. The hemoglobin count was 9.2 g/dL; white blood cell count was 11.6 K/uL and other hematologic and biochemical findings were normal. Chest x-rays of the patient revealed left hemothorax; thus, tube thoracostomy was performed on the left side. The drain was removed on the 4th day and the control x-ray of the patient showed no complications. The patient was discharged on the 6th day of hospitalization. On chest x-ray obtained on an outpatient basis after one month, a cavitary lesion with thick walls containing air fluid levels was observed in the left middle zone. The findings of CT evaluation were consistent with TPP (Figure ). She was treated conservatively without any surgical intervention and empiric antibiotherapy. Subsequent x-rays at 2 week intervals showed progressive resolution of TPP. After 3 months, the x-ray showed no cystic lesion and the lesion had completely disappeared on CT imaging.", "age": "[[24.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12493502': 1, '6394293': 1, '27239612': 1, '12435957': 1, '14344349': 1, '8998532': 1, '9156292': 1, '17094311': 1, '2810415': 1, '12707537': 1, '28515753': 2, '33623878': 1, '454006': 1, '16600612': 1, '7321063': 1, '15654191': 1, '7785615': 1, '877788': 1, '2915566': 1, '26038263': 1, '33061003': 1, '17953772': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2117003-1': 2, '5404132-1': 1}"}
