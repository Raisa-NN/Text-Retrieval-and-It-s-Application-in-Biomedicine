He had suffered hypersensitive reactions to mosquito bites, such as skin lesions (ex, nodules, pustules, ulcerations), edematous change on the whole body and the extremities and fever, from childhood. Hepatosplenomegaly or peripheral lymphadenopathy was not detected. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell count 7.0\u00d7109/L, hemoglobin 15.0 g/dL, platelet 272\u00d7109/L, biochemical profile, including lactate dehydrogenase, was in the normal range. EBV anti-EA-DR IgG, anti-EBNA was positive and serum titer of IgG against EBV VCA increased. Peripheral blood smear revealed many large granular lymphocytes (). Immunophenotypic analysis demonstrated that CD16+CD56+ cells increased (79%) and CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells decreased (15%, 8%, 7%). We found rearrangement of TCR\u03b3-chain gene by PCR analysis in this case (), as in some cases of the GLPD. In our case, V\u03b3-J\u03b3 consensus primers (5\u2032AGGGTTGTGTTGGAATCAGG3\u2032 and 5\u2032CGTCGACAACAA GTGTTGTTCCAC3\u2032) for TCR\u03b3-chain gene were used. PCR amplification with specific primers for TCR\u03b3-chain gene demonstrated a single band of approximately 160\u2013190 bp for V\u03b3-J\u03b3 products. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed no abnormalities. Finally, we diagnosed this patient as NK-LGL lymphocytosis associated with HMB.", "age": "[[19.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27900557': 1, '2827810': 1, '7962966': 1, '27988064': 1, '1689990': 1, '4320657': 1, '9045900': 1, '827912': 1, '23341729': 2, '10193407': 1, '2544630': 1, '2571673': 1, '6133020': 1, '12760269': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3546098-1': 1}"}
