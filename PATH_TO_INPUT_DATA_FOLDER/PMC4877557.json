Brain CT performed at one week after onset showed an ICH in the left corona radiata and basal ganglia, and a left-to-right midline shift of 6.5 mm (). Brain MRI performed at one month after onset showed a leukomalatic lesion in the same regions (). On K-WAB performed at one and three months after onset, the patient presented with Broca's aphasia. The aphasia showed improvement at three months after onset, compared with that at one month after onset (one month-aphasia quotient : 15, fluency : 5.8, comprehension : 72, repetition : 0, naming : 13; three months - aphasia quotient : 28, fluency : 6, comprehension : 137, repetition : 14.5, naming : 26.3).", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12681350': 1, '22544455': 1, '21386711': 1, '18157658': 1, '10187873': 1, '18050325': 1, '7490638': 1, '22982143': 1, '15891571': 1, '11834604': 1, '16564566': 1, '20488905': 1, '15590457': 1, '28930819': 1, '28664037': 1, '19434402': 1, '10211466': 1, '18614162': 1, '23042924': 1, '27226866': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4877557-1': 2}"}
