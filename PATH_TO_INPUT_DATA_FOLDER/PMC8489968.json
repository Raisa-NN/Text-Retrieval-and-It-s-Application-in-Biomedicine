The forearm flap was harvested as usual, but the vascular lumen cross section of the forearm cutaneous vein, which is the main drainage vein, showed a honeycomb structure that unexpectedly continued for about 40 mm without interruption (). As end-to-side anastomosis to the internal jugular vein was considered inappropriate, the portion of the vein with inadequate drainage was cut out along a length of about 50 mm to the site where the normal vascular lumen appeared. The distal end of the external jugular vein was then anastomosed to the venous stump, and a very fine accompanying radial artery vein was additionally anastomosed ().", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22942661': 1, '15318053': 1, '29661366': 1, '8956596': 1, '4016428': 1, '9768955': 1, '34616542': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8489968-1': 2}"}
