At 12 + 6 weeks of pregnancy, ultrasound examination showed that the right upper limb of the fetus was overflexed, and the right hand was adhered to the umbilical cord with limited movement. Reexamination at 15 + 1 week of pregnancy detected adhesion between both fetal hands and umbilical cord, unclear border of anterior chest wall, and multiple band-like echos in amniotic cavity. Intrauterine death was found at 19 + 4 weeks. After induction of labor, the deformities of both hands, the defect of anterior chest wall, and the adhesion between fetal upper limb and umbilical cord surface by amniotic bands were found.", "age": "[[39.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'24735486': 1, '9218946': 1, '26932755': 1, '1348990': 1, '9444043': 1, '17602029': 1, '21785605': 2, '18412792': 1, '28870722': 1, '29756715': 1, '1794679': 1, '20062685': 2, '31852110': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6922433-1': 2, '3139904-1': 1, '2803905-1': 1}"}
