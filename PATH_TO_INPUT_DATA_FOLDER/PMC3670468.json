On presentation, vital signs were stable except for fever of 102 F. Cardiopulmonary examination was normal, and there was no lymphadenopathy. The rest of physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis of 17.000/uL and hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were elevated at 44 mm/hr and 8.47 mg/dL, respectively. Patient had negative bacterial and fungal cultures, viral serologies, and tuberculin skin testing. Chest X-ray showed bilateral nodular opacities, and computed tomography (CT) revealed ground glass opacity in the left lower lobe with surrounding nodules (). Bronchoalveolar lavage with biopsies showed granulomas with no organisms. Wedge biopsy was pursued and histopathology showed necrotizing granulomas () with acid-fast bacilli (). Polymerase chain reaction and tissue cultures were positive for MAC, and patient was started on azithromycin, ethambutol, and rifampin.\\nOne month after discharge, she was readmitted with high fevers and hypoxia concerning for severe sepsis. Labs showed leukocytosis of 35.000/uL, alanine transaminase 224 U/L, aspartate transaminase 592 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 480 U/L, and cholestatic jaundice (total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL). Severe sepsis was suspected, and patient was placed empirically on moxifloxacin, amikacin, azithromycin, and rifampin. CT of the chest showed multifocal pneumonia. Infectious workup revealed MAC in the blood with negative viral and bacterial cultures. Her course was complicated by persistent fevers, splenomegaly, and development of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). An elevated ferritin of 38,539 ng/mL and triglyceride of 566 mg/dL were noted. Bone marrow biopsy showed histiocytes with engulfed erythrocytes and nucleated marrow elements (), along with scattered granulomas (). Bone marrow cultures were positive for MAC. A diagnosis of MAC-associated HLH was made, and patient was started on methylprednisolone and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra) with immediate cessation of fever spikes. However, the patient's respiratory status deteriorated and passed away soon after.", "age": "[[22.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28932715': 1, '18820602': 1, '19656707': 1, '22464018': 1, '31072325': 2, '30705096': 1, '26664166': 1, '18045564': 1, '33510976': 2, '28789664': 2, '23762672': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6507031-1': 1, '7831292-1': 1, '5549388-1': 1}"}
