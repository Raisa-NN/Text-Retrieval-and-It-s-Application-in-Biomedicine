She had no underlying disease. After anesthesia induction, a chest band was placed on the patient in a similar manner to case 1. Intraoperative monitoring included the ECG, arterial blood pressure, NIBP, central venous pressure, pulse oximetry and capnogram.\\nThe number of surgical ports and CO2 gas pressure was 4 and 15 mmHg, respectively. The duration of surgery and CO2 insufflation was 450 minutes and 405 minutes, respectively. The intraoperative peak PETCO2 was 43 mmHg. Hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis were not observed by intermittent arterial blood gas analysis. No specific events were encountered during the surgical procedure. After surgery, palpation revealed crepitus over the surgical field to the level of the chest band. CO2 subcutaneous emphysema beyond the chest band was not observed by postoperative chest X-ray (). No chest band related complications were observed. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged 9 days later.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'10960382': 1, '12526151': 1, '8004738': 1, '10775733': 1, '15010588': 1, '7637101': 1, '8452278': 1, '8632576': 1, '11834684': 1, '21253382': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3022138-1': 2}"}
