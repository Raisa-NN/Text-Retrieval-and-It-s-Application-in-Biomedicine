He underwent EBUS-TBNA for the subcarinal lymph nodes (#7), and histopathological analysis showed epithelioid granulomas without caseous necrosis, which was consistent with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient developed high fever, chest pain, and headache 53 days after EBUS-TBNA. Oral antibiotic therapy (levofloxacin, 500 mg/day) was prescribed by a general physician, but his symptoms persisted, and he was readmitted to our hospital. On examination, he exhibited general malaise, an increased body temperature of 37.1\u00b0C, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Pulmonary and cardiovascular physical examinations showed normal findings. Laboratory tests showed an increased WBC count (21,200/mm3) and CRP level (11.9 mg/dL), and chest CT showed enlargement of the subcarinal lymph node with a low-density area (Fig. D). Intravenous antibiotic therapy (tazobactam/piperacillin, 18 g/day) was initiated and surgical drainage was performed on day 2 of hospitalization. The abscess was drained via right mediastinotomy, and the drained fluid exhibited white purulent material. No bacteria were detected. His post-operative course was uneventful, and he was discharged 14 days after hospitalization.", "age": "[[47.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18827619': 1, '20444284': 2, '23663438': 1, '19336596': 1, '24518694': 1, '34011084': 2, '11399011': 1, '28631863': 1, '26277888': 1, '33605045': 2, '26496092': 1, '10534695': 1, '27070336': 1, '25660225': 1, '29054229': 1, '28709438': 2, '21396214': 1, '25802743': 1, '15249452': 1, '20338352': 1, '19407050': 1, '23660451': 1, '26522531': 1, '31007930': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6454807-1': 2, '8017241-1': 1, '5513248-1': 1, '8137064-1': 1, '2880312-1': 1}"}
