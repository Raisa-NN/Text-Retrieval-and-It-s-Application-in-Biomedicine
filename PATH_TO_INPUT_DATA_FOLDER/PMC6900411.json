The procedure was done under general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. She had a total of 6 mg of oxycodone (0.05 mg/kg) and 100 \u03bcg of fentanyl (0.8 \u03bcg/kg) perioperatively. She had been commenced on nocturnal home CPAP therapy two days prior to her first elective surgery. She was non-compliant with CPAP therapy as she found it noisy and felt that it induced a choking sensation. After her first elective procedure, she remained intubated on the first postoperative night.\\nThe emergency procedure concluded uneventfully, and she was managed postoperatively with 40 L/min HFNI on room air in the HDU. There was no documented DI4 or CT90, and no additional intervention was required related to the OSA. She was compliant with the HFNI throughout the first postoperative night, and reported a VAS comfort score of 100 mm for the HFNI therapy, compared to 0 mm for the CPAP therapy.", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26329355': 1, '16735905': 1, '23050520': 1, '20956751': 1, '3931024': 1, '26469321': 1, '8202884': 1, '31426624': 1, '19467849': 1, '19952061': 1, '23857440': 1, '10566911': 1, '17363769': 1, '27442772': 1, '23589584': 1, '14572127': 1, '31304692': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6900411-1': 2, '6900411-2': 2}"}
