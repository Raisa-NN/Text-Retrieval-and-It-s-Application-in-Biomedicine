Her follow-up record stated a 35\u202fkg weight loss after one year. She then progressively gained weight despite dietetic follow-up and five years after SG, her weight was 116\u202fkg and BMI 39.7\u202fkg/m2. Multidisciplinary discussion led to perform laparoscopic exploration and a redo-SG [,].\\nLaparoscopy proved impossible due to very numerous severe intra-abdominal adhesions and an open OGB was decided in March 2016. In a first step, a complete viscerolysis was realized. Then, a long and narrow gastric tube was created by applying one horizontal 45\u202fmm roticulator Endo-GIA\u00ae stapler (Medtronic\u00ae, Minneapolis, MN, USA) at the angle of the lesser curvature, and then 4 vertical 60\u202fmm roticulator Endo-GIA\u00ae upward to the angle of His. At 200\u202fcm from the ligament of Treitz, jejunum was mounted in precolic manner, and a side-to-end anastomosis to the gastric tube was performed with a posterior 45\u202fmm Endo-GIA\u00ae stapler. Post-operative stage was unremarkable.\\nThe patient was discharged with a vitamin prescription (Multivitamin cocktail including vitamin B9\u202f=\u202f1350\u202f\u03bcg daily), as usually delivered in our bariatric surgery department. Six months after OGB her haemoglobin level was 11\u202fg/dl (12.4\u202fg/dl preoperatively). She was then followed up on a regular basis, and her vitamins were normally prescribed. Two years after the OGB, she was still taking her daily vitamins, her weight loss topped at 21\u202fkg, and her weight reached 95\u202fkg with a BMI of 32.5\u202fkg/m2. Our patient had adequate serum vitamins levels two years after bypass. She became pregnant in January 2018. Her first trimester ultrasound was reported as normal. During the first trimester of pregnancy, on her gynecologist advice, she stopped taking vitamins. No vitamin assay was carried out. The second trimester ultrasound unfortunately reported a myelomeningocele and surgical abortion was performed at 25 weeks of gestation.", "age": "[[26.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26350391': 1, '16940875': 1, '2872457': 1, '18447680': 1, '29303218': 1, '26490773': 1, '24512081': 1, '24706197': 1, '26178026': 1, '28392254': 1, '15646304': 1, '30167574': 1, '30342279': 1, '28216963': 1, '29903686': 1, '2894563': 1, '28286691': 1, '23774085': 1, '14502333': 1, '22296248': 1, '19930766': 1, '22523660': 1, '22900183': 1, '23225208': 1, '24355940': 1, '19017915': 1, '25857443': 1, '29707111': 1, '32417729': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
