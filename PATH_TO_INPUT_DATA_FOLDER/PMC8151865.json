He underwent the Fontan operation as a newborn, as he had an atrioventricular septal defect, transposition of the great arteries, and dextrocardia. He was prescribed oral warfarin to prevent thromboembolic events while maintaining an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2\u20133. Recently, he stopped taking warfarin consistently; moreover, there was no routine INR monitoring. The initial INR was 1.46, a daily dose of warfarin of 1.5 mg. Imaging studies revealed right middle cerebral artery infarction, pulmonary thromboembolism in the main bronchial artery, and bilateral multifocal renal infarctions (). Based on his poor adherence to warfarin, we decided to switch him to dabigatran 150 mg bid. One month later, his pulmonary thromboembolism had regressed. He recovered neurologically via intense rehabilitation and was referred to a clinic for long-term inpatient rehabilitation.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31132584': 1, '30703530': 1, '29575675': 1, '32273316': 1, '21798429': 1, '20075360': 1, '11834064': 1, '31547188': 1, '29685556': 1, '23991661': 1, '34068569': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
