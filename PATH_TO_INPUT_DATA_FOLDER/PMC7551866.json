For all this time, she had received excellent empathetic care from her family doctor and her physician. She was in severe pain requiring opiates, and was nursed on a ripple bed. She had a urinary catheter in place and received nutrition via a nasojejunal tube.\\nDespite the severity of her condition, with fierce intelligence and determination, she managed to write a book for doctors and families on how Severe ME should be managed [].\\nI remember meeting her around this time and thinking that it only needed one extra stressor to tip her over the brink and cause her death.\\nSadly, a few months later, she developed renal colic, which necessitated her admission to hospital. Her own physician was not allowed to manage her (for some reason of internal hospital politics). The physician assigned to her care freely admitted he knew nothing about ME/CFS, and although she was nursed in a side room, she was still subjected to sensory overload. The physician used to come to her bedside with his entourage and engage in long arguments with her. She died of her ME in hospital a few weeks later.\\nThis case demonstrates that it is not only emotional upset that can result from maltreatment, but very real medical harm to an extent that can be life threatening.", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'31968124': 1, '34683011': 1, '21619607': 1, '33919671': 1, '34222292': 1, '24210197': 1, '33374291': 1, '34828583': 1, '34070286': 1, '33659857': 1, '9201655': 1, '34828592': 2, '28674681': 1, '32328892': 1, '32674263': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7551866-1': 2, '7551866-2': 2, '8623195-1': 1, '8623195-2': 1, '8623195-3': 1, '8623195-4': 1}"}
