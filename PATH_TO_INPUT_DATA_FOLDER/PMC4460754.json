Because her intraoperative hemorrhaging was severe, large volumes of blood were transfused. The total hemorrhage at the time of wound closure was 2500 mL. Despite massive infusion of blood, hypotension was remained; her systolic blood pressure was approximately 60 mmHg. Considering the possibility of heart failure due to massive infusion, we performed TTE (Vivid S6), which revealed severe hypovolemia without cardiac dysfunction (very small LV end-diastolic diameter with good contraction). Although there was no apparent hemorrhage via drainage, we reported the TTE findings to the surgeons and insisted on reopening of the wound. This revealed approximately 1800 mL of additional venous hemorrhage. The surgeon achieved complete hemostasis and the patient did well thereafter.", "age": "[[78.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'32471436': 1, '23247304': 1, '19058977': 1, '10867090': 1, '31804926': 1, '17088454': 1, '19549642': 1, '21401539': 1, '3970360': 1, '18837986': 1, '25249585': 1, '12974974': 1, '22352785': 1, '15595582': 1, '20865866': 1, '8271983': 1, '17446774': 1, '21111923': 1, '23011559': 1, '10997353': 1, '33816785': 1, '26059903': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4460754-1': 2, '4460754-2': 2}"}
