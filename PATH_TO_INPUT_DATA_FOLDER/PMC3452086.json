She had a history of migraine, but did not recognize this type of headache as her migraine headache. She frequently used sumatriptan and 1 week before admission, because of severe attacks, she had used sumatriptan daily with temporally good response. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/88 and neurological examination was normal. SAH was ruled out by CT scan and CSF examination was completely normal. Following day, she became confused with behavioral changes. Brain MRI/MRA revealed no abnormalities. TCD showed increased blood flow velocities over the medial cerebral artery (109 cm/s) and anterior cerebral artery (108 cm/s). Under the suspicion of RCVS, calcium antagonist verapamil 120 mg twice daily was started. Within a day, the patient improved clinically and TCD after 4 days showed normal blood flow velocities of medial cerebral artery (80 cm/s) and anterior cerebral artery (66 cm/s). She was discharged at home without any complaints and was strongly advised not resume any triptans.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16635442': 1, '32258552': 1, '12662181': 1, '20425193': 1, '25123846': 1, '15111686': 1, '31920665': 1, '25614476': 1, '34214263': 1, '16832100': 1, '25593203': 1, '15118961': 1, '17190937': 1, '16781992': 1, '22518264': 1, '29922403': 1, '19370308': 1, '33868555': 1, '17880561': 1, '3046073': 1, '31804357': 1, '20186562': 1, '24707417': 2, '18025032': 1, '15012662': 1, '18496847': 1, '17200220': 1, '22422190': 1, '8592737': 1, '14720314': 1, '18810315': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3452086-1': 2, '3965932-1': 1, '3965932-2': 1, '3965932-3': 1}"}
