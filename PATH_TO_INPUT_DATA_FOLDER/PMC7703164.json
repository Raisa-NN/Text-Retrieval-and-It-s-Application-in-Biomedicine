After 3 days of persistent symptoms, he scheduled an urgent medical appointment. Chest radiography (A) showed bilateral nonspecific poorly defined opacities, and blood tests revealed mild lymphopenia (0.89 X 109 /L) and an C-reactive protein (CRP) of 97.9 mg/L (reference range, [<0.5 mg/L]). An upper respiratory tract infection was assumed, and since the patient was hemodynamically stable, the housing conditions were very good an there was no epidemiological data of suspicion for the newly presented COVID-19 disease, he was discharged home with azithromycin for three days and paracetamol.\\nConcerning this patient\u2019s medical background, he had Gleason 8 prostate cancer diagnosed in 2001 and initially treated with androgen blockade. In 2012, he developed castration resistance with bone metastasis being started on abiraterone plus 10mg prednisolone in February 2015, after progressing on docetaxel. PSA levels remained undetectable since then. He additionally had a history of stage I large cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma submitted to inferior left lobe segmentectomy in March 2014, on follow-up; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), GOLD A, with no recent exacerbations; former smoker (60 pack-years) and a history of pulmonary tuberculosis during childhood.\\nOn the 14th of March, the patient returned to the hospital with worsening symptoms, having developed dyspnea (23 cycles per minute) and hypoxemia, with a partial pressure of oxygen of 56 mmHg on a 15 liter per minute oxygen mask, yet being hemodynamically stable and apyretic. Chest radiography showed multiple peripheral nodular infiltrate and lower right condensation (B). Blood tests detected leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and CRP levels with rising kinetics (). A nasopharyngeal swab was collected, which was positive for SARS-CoV-2.\\nCOVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 of 160 mmHg), with probable bacterial superinfection, was assumed. The patient was, therefore, intubated and transferred to the Intensive care unit (ICU) (C), being started on empirical piperacillin/tazobactam, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir ().\\nAminergic support was required for the first 4 days, during which he kept fever, sustained elevation of leukocytes count, CRP, and procalcitonin levels. Azithromycin was then administered along with the supra cited therapy. Blood cultures and secretions were sterile since admission. Due to the maintenance of low PaO2/FiO2, 40mg of IV methylprednisolone were administered daily from days 7 to 12 and then tapered to 10mg prednisolone from day 17. Prone positioning periods were adopted for a total of two days.\\nHereafter, from the 10th day, there was a progressive improvement of the respiratory and hemodynamic function, which permitted patient extubation, with a PaO2 of 80 mmHg with 4L/min supplemental oxygen administered by nasal cannula (, A).\\nThe patient was discharged from the ICU 14 days after admission to the infectious diseases ward. Chest radiography evolution showed a reduction in lung infiltrates (B). The SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab was the first negative on the 19th day of admission.\\nThe patient was considered to be cured on the 24th day after admission, being able to resume his previous oncological treatment with abiraterone and prednisolone. He was discharged to a rehabilitation unit to recover from intensive care related myopathy, and his respiratory condition is improving since then, with no further need for supplementary oxygen therapy.", "age": "[[77.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'32179124': 1, '24868562': 1, '19482247': 1, '32282022': 1, '32401989': 1, '32066541': 1, '32205204': 1, '31924756': 1, '27843637': 1, '32203977': 1, '32224151': 1, '32167524': 1, '33344300': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
