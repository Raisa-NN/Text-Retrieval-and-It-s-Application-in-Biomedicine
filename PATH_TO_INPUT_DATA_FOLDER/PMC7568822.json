He reported the use of AAS for two months before his admission. Specifically, he took intramuscular testosterone 250 mg twice per week. His blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg, and heart rate was 106 beats/min. His laboratory blood analysis revealed cardiac troponin 8.5 ng/mL, \u2028CK = 700 IU/L, CK-MB = 302 IU/L. After the last lifting of a heavy weight, which exerted tremendous pressure on his chest wall, the patient suddenly complained of a heavy chest and back pain, irradiating to the shoulders. In the emergency room, an instant drop in blood pressure to 80/30mmHg was documented, and the patient developed a cardiogenic shock because of cardiac tamponade. The patient was immediately transferred to the operating room. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a tricuspid aortic valve with moderate aortic regurgitation and an aortic annulus, which was in the normal upper limit (44mm). After implantation of the supracoronary graft, TEE demonstrated a mild residual tricuspid aortic valve regurgitation that could be left in situ. Further postoperative course was uneventful. A TTE in the outpatient clinic, more than two months after aortic surgery, could not demonstrate mild residual aortic regurgitation.", "age": "[[33.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26618057': 1, '14977687': 1, '18388062': 1, '15248788': 1, '16059740': 1, '14649214': 1, '24259990': 1, '20153798': 1, '30826541': 1, '34441248': 1, '19067736': 1, '24494079': 1, '19337562': 1, '27738530': 2, '16840178': 1, '16292586': 1, '22379549': 1, '11817994': 1, '23097484': 1, '33083037': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7568822-1': 2, '7568822-2': 2, '7568822-3': 2, '7568822-4': 2, '5050354-1': 1}"}
