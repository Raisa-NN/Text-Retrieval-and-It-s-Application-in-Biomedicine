She was having an intermittent fever with cough for the past 3 months; however, she was attending her college regularly. She also had some retrosternal heaviness with \u201cburning sensation\u201d for the same duration. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed a day before was apparently normal. On admission, she was restless, diaphoretic with cold clammy and cyanotic extremities, heart rate 120/min, and blood pressure 40 mmHg (by palpation). Systemic examination was unremarkable.\\nPrompt resuscitation was initiated with a fluid bolus of 1000 ml normal saline, noradrenaline infusion, rapid sequence intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Meropenem was given empirically. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Arterial blood gas showed \u2013 pH 6.76, PCO2-75.9 mmHg, PO2-42 mmHg, HCO3-10.3 mmol/L, and lactate \u2013 11.9 mmol/L. Transthoracic echocardiography was done which showed a lobulated mass in the left atrium with a stalk attached to the lateral wall of atrial [], which was moving to and fro across the mitral valve []. Chamber sizes appeared slightly dilated on the right side with no regional wall motion abnormality, no apparent valvular pathology, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%\u201360%. A provisional diagnosis of cardiac tumor, possibly left atrial myxoma with obstructive shock was made, and the cardiothoracic surgeon was consulted; however, the patient had a cardiac arrest and expired before any definite surgical intervention could be executed.", "age": "[[21.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11772872': 1, '20565878': 2, '21940296': 1, '21839650': 1, '18612442': 1, '24482970': 1, '7477198': 1, '26313389': 1, '24968552': 1, '27688631': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2894750-1': 1}"}
