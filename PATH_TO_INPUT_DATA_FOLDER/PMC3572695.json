The patient reported that he had some vague pain shortly before but now the pain was sharp and rated as 10 out of 10 on the pain scale. The patient was able to walk to the bathroom without aid this morning and is usually able to ambulate half a block before getting tired. The patient denied fever, loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, photophobia, or aura. His home medications included acetaminophen and hydrocodone. The patient had no allergies. Prior surgeries included coronary artery bypass graft and two stents. The patient had a 64 pack year smoking history and denied alcohol or drug use.\\nThe patient's initial vital signs in the ED were as follows: blood pressure (BP) 132/88 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 96, respiratory rate (RR) 14, and an oxygen saturation of 94% at room air. He was alert and oriented without acute distress. Heart sounds were regular, with no murmur, click, bruit, or rubs noted. Breath sounds were clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen was soft, nontender, with no pulsatile mass, rebound, or guarding. The left lower extremity was pale and cold compared to the contralateral leg with strength at a one out of five. The ED physician was unable to palpate or detect a Doppler signal in the left femoral, popliteal, posterior tibialis, and dorsalis pedis arteries. Strength was 5/5 in right lower extremity. No edema or erythema was present. Bedside ultrasound was performed which showed nonpulsatile bilateral femoral artery and limited flow. The decision was made to perform an AAA screening ultrasound, which showed a 4.61 cm infrarenal AAA and an intimal flap (). The sagittal view showed a 4.99 cm AAA and complete aortoocclusion by the thrombus ().\\nEmergent CT-angiography (CTA) was performed, which showed a thrombosed 5.5 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm. The dissection was not detected since the contrast was unable to pass through the thrombus. Vascular surgery was promptly contacted and the patient underwent emergent aortobifemoral bypass, bilateral four-compartment fasciotomy, right common femoral artery endarterectomy with profundoplasty, and subsequent left above the knee amputation.", "age": "[[78.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21871765': 1, '19713607': 1, '12098184': 1, '32637271': 2, '18926345': 1, '34457268': 1, '22288871': 1, '22458748': 1, '19319592': 1, '23431495': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7331895-1': 1}"}
