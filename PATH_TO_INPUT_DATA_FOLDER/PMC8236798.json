The preoperative estimated prostate weight was 186 g. General anesthesia was induced, and surgery was performed. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed the following: pH, 7.404; BE, \u22121.1; Hb, 122 g/L; Na, 139.9 mmol/L; and Cl, 107 mmol/L. Ephedrine and phenylephrine were administered intraoperatively because of a sudden decrease in blood pressure. Intraoperative laboratory test results 65 minutes after beginning surgery were as follows: pH, 7.298; BE, \u22125.6; Hb, 83 g/L; Na, 142.9 mmol/L; and Cl, 119 mmol/L. Capsular perforation was also observed. The estimated blood loss was 1000 mL, operation time was 95 minutes, resected prostate weight was 63 g, and irrigation fluid volume was 24 L.
