On examination, a 5 \u00d7 5 mm solitary, bluish white coloured swelling on left side of lower lip was noted []. The swelling was nontender and soft on palpation. Provisional diagnosis of mucocele was made and excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. The tissue fixed in formalin was received in the department of oral pathology and microbiology. The H and E-stained sections revealed stratified squamous epithelium overlying fibrocellular connective tissue stroma. The deeper connective tissue showed a dilated minor salivary gland duct. The epithelial lining of the duct appeared bilayered and revealed oncocytic metaplasia. Dense chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed chiefly of lymphocytes was seen around the dilated duct. The predominantly mucous salivary gland acini present in deeper connective tissue showed normal architecture with no inflammatory cell infiltration around them [Figures \u2013]. The connective tissue also revealed endothelium lined blood vessels of varying caliber.\\nThe case was diagnosed as salivary duct cyst and the patient was recalled after 6 months or earlier in case of a recurrence.", "age": "[[15.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31731335': 1, '19415059': 1, '15132815': 1, '7251405': 1, '25987947': 1, '14176606': 1, '27829772': 1, '8180481': 1, '11383640': 1, '20038883': 1, '9182291': 1, '15735552': 1, '6594658': 1, '13692640': 1, '22402300': 1, '13376792': 1, '2518064': 1, '20930340': 1, '22114395': 2, '1054452': 1, '9540745': 1, '25364168': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3220081-1': 1}"}
