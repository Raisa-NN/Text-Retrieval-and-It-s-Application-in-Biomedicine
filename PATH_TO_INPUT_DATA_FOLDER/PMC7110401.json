She exhibited 4/5 strength in the right upper/right lower extremity, 3/5 strength in the left lower extremity, and bilateral Babinski responses without any sensory findings.\\nThe CT scan directly confirmed hyperdense posterolateral ossification indicative of OYL measuring 25 mm \u00d7 14 mm \u00d7 7 mm []. The MRI examination of the cervical spinal documented cervical stenosis with cord compression at the C2 level due to OLF; the T2-WT MRI demonstrated a hypointense posterolateral lesion consistent with OLF measuring approximately 7.02 cm \u00d7 2.58 cm (CC \u00d7 AP) []. Both MR and CT studies demonstrated that OLF reduced the sagittal canal diameter of the spinal canal to just 3.55 mm.\\nThe patient underwent a decompressive C1-C2 cervical laminectomy. At surgery, OLF had to be carefully dissected away from the dura using an operating microscope; a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was averted. Eight days postoperatively, the patient exhibited significant improvement, and within 2 postoperative months, regained normal function.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21361753': 1, '29915206': 1, '31124460': 2, '25983784': 2, '30687574': 2, '30276070': 1, '32257563': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4432380-1': 1, '6533938-1': 1, '6322170-1': 1}"}
