In his physical examination, he reported a limitation in all left hip movements, and other physical examinations were normal. The results of a complete hemogram, coagulation panel, thyroid function testing, and blood sugar monitoring were all normal. The levels of rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and C-reactive protein were within normal limits, ruling out inflammatory arthritis-related osteoporosis. Vitamin D levels were 35 ng/ml, and serum calcium was 9.5 mmol. The renal parameters, serum phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone were all within normal limits.\\nThrough the coronal view of the left hip's T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), widespread bone marrow edema was observed, consistent with transient osteoporosis of the hip (Figure ).\\nAfter three months of rest and therapy with vitamin D3 supplements (50,000 IU, one pearl each week), calcium (1000 IU, one tablet each day), and Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication (Naproxen 500 mg, two tablets in a day), the patient was scheduled for a follow-up checkup. He had a good outcome from the subsequent appointment. Three months after starting a course of therapy, the latest MRI scan showed improvement in the edema of bone marrow (Figure ).", "age": "[[46.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24587837': 1, '28314897': 1, '12799758': 1, '12812240': 1, '32021501': 1, '20234861': 1, '28790475': 1, '34691465': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
