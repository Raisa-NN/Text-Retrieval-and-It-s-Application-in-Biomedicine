The examination in a local hospital indicated a massive left pleural effusion on chest radiograph; however, no fishbone was found under laryngoscopy. Due to her rapidly decreasing blood pressure even after massive liquid infusion, the patient was quickly transferred to our hospital for further treatment.\\nThe patient had a free previous medical history.\\nAt the time of admission, the patient was in a light coma. Vital signs showed a heart rate of 129 beats/min and blood pressure of 69/35 mmHg.\\nBlood tests revealed that her hemoglobin was 46 g/L.\\nThe enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) showed a pseudoaneurysm in the initial segment of the left vertebral artery and massive effusion in the mediastinum and the left thoracic cavity (Figure ).", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26496319': 2, '300066': 1, '31335713': 2, '21739395': 1, '23809936': 1, '7401676': 1, '28579279': 1, '26783485': 1, '12835368': 1, '2322040': 1, '26330922': 1, '33195670': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4620753-1': 1, '6709094-1': 1}"}
