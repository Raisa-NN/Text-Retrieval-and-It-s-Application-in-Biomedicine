On clinical examination, patient had pain and difficulty moving Rt./Lt.Wrist. Patient was not having any significant past history. Radiographs of injured distal forearm with wrist were obtained, on finding difficulty in analyzing the injury precisely radiograph of opposite distal forearm with wrist was taken for comparison. Patient was given short general anaesthesia (SGA) and surgical treatment in the form of closed reduction and K-wire fixation for fracture of distal radius. Ulnar epiphyseal fracture required open reduction using extended ulnar approach. Reduction was achieved in pronation, maintained and fixed with K-wire as closed reduction was not possible due to soft tissue interposition. DRUJ was also fixed using K-wire passed from ulna to radius. Patient was given immobilization in the form of AE slab. Reduction was confirmed post operatively. K-wires were removed at 3 weeks. No complication was encountered and patient has regain wrist ROM shown below with the pictures and post-operative follow up X-rays. with X-rays.", "age": "[[13.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30443630': 2, '8525823': 1, '5014830': 1, '4010824': 1, '3440807': 1, '2056081': 1, '2295168': 1, '3680332': 1, '16568522': 1, '34017662': 2, '8479730': 1, '4030834': 1, '27298996': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6230361-1': 1, '8130638-1': 1}"}
