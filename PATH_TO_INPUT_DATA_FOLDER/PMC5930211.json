On examination, her right anterolateral neck was swollen, warm, and tender. Hemogram revealed total leukocyte count of 13,200/mm3, with neutrophil count of 11,220/mm3. Computed tomography scan of the neck revealed 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm \u00d7 6 cm fluid collection in the right lobe of thyroid gland extending superiorly to the submandibular region, inferiorly to the clavicular head, medially involving the isthmus, and a part of the left lobe with mild compression of the trachea (Fig. A and B). Purulent fluid was aspirated from the collection, which grew methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus. Patient improved completely after ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of the abscess and cefuroxime therapy. Thyroid profile showed FT3-3.8 pg/mL (2.3\u20134.2), FT4-1.4 ng/mL (0.89\u20131.76), and TSH-0.65 \u03bcIU/mL (0.35\u20135.5). Thyroid gland is resistant to infection because of its encapsulation, high iodide content, rich blood supply, and extensive lymphatic drainage . Suppurative thyroiditis usually develops in patients with pre-existing thyroid disease (multinodular goiter or thyroid cancer), congenital anomalies like pyriform sinus fistula, and immunocompromised state . Therapy consists of appropriate antibiotics, drainage of abscess, and partial or total thyroidectomy.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12826640': 1, '29744096': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
