For trigeminal neuralgia, she was on various oral medications, namely, carbamazepine (CBZ), amitriptyline, clonazepam, tizanidine, and tramadol (as and when required) for the past 2 years. Three months back, she was diagnosed to have hypertension and was put on oral amlodipine 5 mg once a day.\\nFor the past 2 months, she was having the pain of increasing intensity with gradually enlarging gingival swelling. Gingival enlargement was present throughout but was more obvious on the facial aspect (involvement of the upper and lower teeth). The lesions were inflamed, mulberry shaped, firm, and reddish, with lobulated surface and no tendency to bleed []. Amlodipine was replaced with olmesartan and was advised chlorhexidine mouthwash for regular use. Her blood parameters were within normal limits. On the follow-up visit after 2 weeks, she informed that her swelling and symptoms have lessened []. She continued with the chlorhexidine mouthwash along with other medications. Fifteen days later, she turned up with similar complaints of pain and swelling []. It was learned that tablet fluoxetine was substituted for amitriptyline by her physician. Fluoxetine was stopped and the patient was advised to continue the remaining drugs. In view of the patient's drug history, a possibility of the drug-induced GO was considered.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9680902': 1, '15562922': 1, '2027492': 1, '10687229': 1, '16398689': 1, '29629324': 1, '18855610': 1, '29033487': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
