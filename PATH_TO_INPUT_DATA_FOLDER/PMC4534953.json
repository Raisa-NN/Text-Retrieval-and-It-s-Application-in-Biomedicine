Despite extensive laboratory investigation which included a decalcified bone biopsy of the distal tibia, no specific cause of her discomfort was discovered, but the pain gradually subsided without treatment.\\nSeveral months prior to her admission to the clinical Research Center at Barnes Hospital, the patient developed bilateral foot pain. X-ray examination was reproted as normal, but a 99Tc-pyrophosphate bone scan revealed multiple \u201chot spots\u201d in her feet. A diagnosis of \u201cstress fractures\u201d was made and she was fitted with orthopedic shoes to minimize the stress while walking. Despite these measures the same symptoms reappeared in her left foot, and she was referred to our service for further evaluation.\\nThe patient had undergone a hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy at age 34, and she had never received estrogen replacement therapy. Her calcium and vitamin D intake was adequate and included three 8 oz, glasses of milk daily. She had never received dilantin, phenobarbital, antacids, glucocorticoids, heparin, vitamin D, calcium supplements, or fluoride, all of which could potentially affect her skeletal status. Similarly, she experienced no prolonged food intolerance, diarrhea or steatorrhea.\\nThe patient appeared well nourished but walked with a slight limp because of foot pain. There was edema of the left ankle and tenderness about the internal malleolus. Her routine laboratory evaluation was normal and those values which pertain to bone are listed in . Radiographs showed diffuse osteopenia and minimal degenerative changes in the spine and feet and there were no pseudofractures.\\nA transiliac bone biopsy specimen was obtained following two three-day courses of tetracycline, separated by 14 days. The specimen was fixed in neutral phosphate-buffered formaldehyde solution, embedded in methyl methacrylate and sectioned at 5mm using a Jung Model K Sledge Microtome (Heidelberg, Germany). Sections were stained with modified Masson, and Goldner, and histomorphometric analysis was performed with a Merz-Schenk Integrating Eyepiece. The following parameters were measured in trabecular bone as previously described:\\n% total bone volume, or % of medullary space occupied by bone matrix; % relative osteoid volume, or % of bone matrix composed of osteoid (unmineralized matrix); % total osteoid surface, or % of trabecular surface covered by osteoid; % osteoblastic osteoid surface, or % of trabecular surface covered by osteoid lined by characteristic osteoblasts; mean osteoid seam width; number of osteoclasts/mm medullary space; % total resorptive surface, or % of trabecular surface containing scalloped resorptive bays (How-ship\u2019s lacunae); % osteoclastic resorptive surface, or % of trabecular surface in apposition to osteoclasts; and % fibrotic surface, or % trabecular surface in apposition to marrow fibrosis.\\nSpecial stains for aluminum intoxication were also performed. Tetracycline-based parameters included the percentage of osteoid seams assuming a fluorescent label and the cellular rate of mineralization, or the mean distance between double labels divided by the interdose duration.\\nThe patient\u2019s biopsy contained approximately ten times the normal quantity of osteoid (, ). While some osteoid seams were, thick, the predominant cause of the hyperosteoidosis was an increase in the percentage of trabecular surface covered by unmineralized matrix. There was also a slight proliferation of osteoclasts and mild peritrabecular marrow fibrosis. The tetracycline-based parameters confirmed the impression of severe osteomalacia. Less than 8% of osteoid seams (% total surface covered by tetracycline/total osteoid surface) assumed a fluorescent label, whereas under normal circumstances, such fluorescent bans should be present in apposition to at least 65% of these seams. On the other hand, of those few foci where double label formation had occurred, the cellular rate of mineralization was normal.\\nIn summary, osteomalacia was diagnosed in this case by the non-decalcified bone biopsy. However, the etiology was unclear, since the patient\u2019s routine laboratory findings and bone parameters were completely normal.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'6998610': 1, '737565': 1, '14255816': 1, '7058831': 1, '363010': 1, '79539': 1, '5474733': 1, '14158235': 1, '7079777': 1, '3154190': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
