She presented with hoarseness and typical skin lesions since adolescence. About 7 years ago she developed a gradually progressive dysphagia to solid food as a predominant symptom and complained of intermittent post-prandial chest pain without regurgitation or weight loss. She had no history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), seizures, visual disturbances, or respiratory obstruction. None of the other family members were affected. Examination revealed an otherwise healthy individual with typical clinical findings of LP (). Systemic examination and laboratory tests did not reveal any abnormalities. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed widespread mucosal thickening and irregularity in the pharynx and larynx. Upper and middle parts of the esophagus were normal, but an esophageal ring with normal overlying mucosa was observed in distal esophagus (). High-resolution manometry showed absent peristalsis ().", "age": "[[34.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9704823': 1, '25045357': 2, '3191019': 1, '4163675': 1, '17910705': 1, '11929856': 1, '24320796': 1, '22737480': 2, '17063986': 1, '15327549': 1, '12472532': 1, '23259080': 1, '24748909': 1, '12603844': 1, '2409038': 1, '29682250': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3371961-1': 1, '4089944-1': 1}"}
