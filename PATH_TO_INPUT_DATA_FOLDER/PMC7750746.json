He had reported mild symptoms with aural fullness for several years. On physical\\nexamination, an ovoid hard mass was observed in the right EAC (). Temporal bone computed tomography\\nrevealed a 0.6 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm anterior-based, pedunculated, bony mass originating from the\\ntympanosquamous suture line (). Because the tumor was of bone origin, surgical excision was planned.\\nAs in Case 1, surgery was performed, and pathology revealed a spongiotic osteoma (). Two years and five\\nmonths after surgery, the patient is without symptoms and there has been no tumor\\nrecurrence.", "age": "[[19.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'32330680': 1, '31750206': 1, '32438822': 1, '30745589': 2, '30199506': 1, '26468817': 1, '22952276': 1, '34884284': 1, '31750138': 1, '27928451': 2, '22143294': 1, '20524130': 1, '15923098': 1, '27755370': 1, '22183765': 1, '16935186': 1, '33414923': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7750746-1': 2, '6843583-1': 1, '5141407-1': 1}"}
