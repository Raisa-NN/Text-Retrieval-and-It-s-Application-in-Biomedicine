Physical examination revealed increased respiratory rate and absence of breath sounds on left of chest. A chest radiograph revealed a bilateral pneumothorax and a left basithoracic opacity []. The chest CT-scan revealed the absence of left main bronchus and left lung parenchyma, and the existence of a right lung hyperinflated crossing the midline with a corresponding pneumothorax []. An echocardiography confirmed the absence of left pulmonary artery without any malformation else. An abdominal CT-scan showed no abnormalities. A surgical pleurodesis was indicated for our patient because of a spontaneous pneumothorax occurring on a single lung. In per operative, by right thoracotomy, there was no left pleural cavity, a cardiac torsion and a herniated right lung presenting many blebs []. Pleurodesis consisted on a mechanical abrasion of the parietal pleura. The postoperative course was uneventful and our patient was discharged on postoperative day 4.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22088223': 1, '20696690': 1, '15280115': 1, '13218221': 1, '11578265': 1, '16769354': 1, '26057001': 1, '10934895': 1, '18514025': 1, '24507772': 1, '18762457': 1, '16972645': 1, '17670349': 1, '23456588': 1, '27051112': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
