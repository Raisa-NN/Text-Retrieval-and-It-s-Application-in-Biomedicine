Mammography revealed left subareolar asymmetry, periareolar skin thickening and axillary lymph node hypertrophy (). Sonography shows a 2.2\u00d71.7-cm ill defined mass with an irregular shape, heterogeneous echogenicity and posterior enhancement (). FNAB was performed to differentiate this from inflammatory breast cancer, but malignant cells were not found. The symptoms were improved after administering antibiotics, and we formed a clinical impression of breast abscess. One year later, the patient presented again with yellowish discharge of the left nipple. On the follow up mammogram, the density of the left subareolar asymmetry and skin thickening was decreased, but it was still observed, and no significant change was observed in the left axillary lymph nodes. On sonography, the previously observed mass showed decreased size (1.5\u00d71.5-cm) and echogenicity. One month after antibiotic administration, the mass disappeared and an irregularly shaped hypoechogenicity was seen on the follow-up sonogram (). About seven months later, the patient presented with a heat sensation and pain on the same area. The previous hypoechogenicity area changed to a 1.1\u00d70.8-cm mass on sonography and a recurrent abscess was suspected (). The mass was excised and pathologically confirmed as a ruptured epidermal inclusion cyst.", "age": "[[44.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26870262': 1, '9240542': 1, '9609889': 1, '23204710': 1, '28932061': 1, '4832515': 1, '8557497': 1, '14994255': 1, '3034689': 1, '31015391': 1, '8416547': 1, '23438279': 1, '632354': 1, '17673849': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2627164-1': 2}"}
