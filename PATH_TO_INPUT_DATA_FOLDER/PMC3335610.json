She had been treated with radiation therapy for a locally aggressive urologic malignancy with not distant metastasis. A surgical plan that involved resection of the tumor, femoral artery, and vein with immediate reconstruction of the vessels and soft tissues was designed for this patient. The abdomen would not be a donor site given her ureterostomy on the right and tumor involvement of both the femoral arterial and venous bifurcations on the left.\\nThe patient underwent resection of the tumor and immediate reconstruction of the femoral artery and vein with heparin-bonded PTFE grafts (Propaten, W.L. Gore, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ) []. Once flow had been established to the left lower extremity, the resulting soft tissue deficit was evaluated. An 8 cm \u00d7 15 cm soft tissue defect in the inguinal region had to be reconstructed. Given the fact that the patient had a history of deep venous thrombosis, resection of the gracilis with the tumor, and reconstruction of the femoral artery and vein from just below the iliac bifurcations to the midthigh we chose to use the anterolateral thigh flap from the opposite extremity. Other flaps such as the rectus abdominis and rectus femoris are other viable options. In this particular case the diep inferior epigastric vessels were part of the resection. The rectus femoris flap is also useful in reconstruction of groin defects. It can be used without the loss of knee extension. The anterolateral thigh is extremely versatile with multiple uses for lower extremity reconstruction [, ].\\nThe flap was designed on the lateral thigh in order to obtain maximal pedicle length (). Skin signals were identified and marked. An exploration incision was made to identify the descending branch off the lateral circumflex femoral artery. The most distal perforators were located and marked on the surface of the skin paddle of the flap. Typical pedicle length for this flap is approximately 12 cm, depending on the location of the flap []. The perforator was the dissected retrograde through the vastus lateralis to the source vessels. The pedicle was dissected to the rectus femoris perforator cranially. Once the dissection was completed, the flap was passed beneath the rectus femoris muscle prior to passage through a subcutaneous tunnel to the defect (). Approximately 17 cm of pedicle length was created to facilitate the transfer. The flap was inset and wounds closed over closed suction drains (). The patient has gone on to heal her wounds. She is ambulatory and pain free with no evidence of local recurrence. Her venous graft has occluded, but her limb swelling is unchanged from her preoperative status. Her arterial reconstruction remains patent.", "age": "[[47.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19952707': 1, '8619002': 1, '19797105': 1, '17215749': 1, '12045540': 1, '22567231': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
