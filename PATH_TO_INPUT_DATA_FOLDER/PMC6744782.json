Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 35-mm sized lesion in the left cerebellum. This lesion showed low intensity on T1-weighted images, high intensity with perifocal edema on T2-weighted images, and avid heterogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted images after gadolinium administration []. The differential diagnosis included metastasis, glioma, and abscess. Surgery was performed using a standard midline suboccipital approach with the patient in the prone position under general anesthesia. The tumor was totally removed and postoperative course was uneventful. The excised specimen was pathologically diagnosed as mucinous adenocarcinoma consisting mainly of proliferating signet ring cells, which was identical to the features seen in the primary urachal adenocarcinoma comprised a mixture of signet ring cells, mucus-producing cells, and duct-forming cells []. This tumor was pathologically, therefore, diagnosed as cerebellar metastasis of the UC. Recurrence was observed at the site of tumor removal 6 months after surgery, and subsequently, gamma knife radiotherapy was performed to remove the lesion.", "age": "[[77.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'14592626': 1, '26181261': 1, '22189321': 1, '29094888': 1, '27592530': 1, '28658940': 1, '26282648': 1, '22532915': 1, '3375977': 1, '7974133': 1, '20945591': 1, '16223181': 1, '27785422': 1, '22901574': 1, '6361280': 1, '31528487': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
