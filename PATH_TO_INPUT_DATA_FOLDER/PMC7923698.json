He had mild dementia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic gastritis for which he was taking multiple medicines. He had felt anal discomfort 3 days prior which gradually worsened and became painful. He felt a sharp, hard object in his anus, but could not remove it on his own due to pain.\\nThe patient's vital signs on presentation were stable. Physical examination showed that his abdomen was soft and without tenderness. No remarkable findings were observed in his anus. On digital rectal examination, we felt something hard and sharp. An attempt to remove it manually failed due to its shape and the patient's pain. At this time, a FB in the anal canal was suspected and we decided to remove it endoscopically.\\nAn endoscope (GIFQ260J; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted transanally with the patient in a left lateral decubitus position. A reticulated and sharp object was observed. Although its identity was unclear, the endoscope was removed to avoid causing mucosal damage. We attached a large-caliber soft oblique cap to the tip of the endoscope and inserted it a second time. A PTP lodged in the anal canal was observed (Fig. ). The PTP was moved into the cap using grasping forceps; it was successfully removed (Fig. , ). There were mild fissures, but no major complications such as perforation or bleeding were observed.", "age": "[[89.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26862844': 1, '10882983': 1, '31942232': 1, '21628009': 1, '26678691': 1, '12024131': 1, '17007065': 1, '12823223': 1, '9002570': 1, '33708061': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
