Her past medical history was insignificant with no history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, joint pains or connective tissue disease. Clinical examination revealed multiple skin-colored, non-tender, firm to hard nodules of varying sizes located over the dorsum of the right ring finger. Examination of the other fingers, toes, nails and hand joints did not reveal any abnormalities. Her hematological and biochemical investigations including a complete hemogram, liver and renal function tests, blood sugar estimations were within normal limits.\\nA skin biopsy of the nodule revealed an infiltrate of histiocytes in a palisading pattern surrounding an area of increased mucin and degenerated collagen present in the lower dermis extending up to the subcutaneous tissue [Figures and ]. There were few multinucleated histiocytes in the granuloma. The rest of the dermis shows a sparse superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.\\nBased on the clinical and histopathological findings, a diagnosis of isolated unilateral deep granuloma annulare localized to one finger was made. The patient was counseled of the benign nature of the disease.", "age": "[[53.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23723470': 2, '10688710': 1, '9374565': 1, '16643151': 1, '11525708': 1, '20418988': 2, '2459983': 1, '18577064': 1, '20649724': 1, '15059219': 1, '26538728': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3667282-1': 1, '2856384-1': 1}"}
