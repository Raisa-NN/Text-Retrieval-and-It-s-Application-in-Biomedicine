Facial features include a prominent nasal root, relatively short nose and large ears. His weight was normal 8.4 kg. Furthermore, he had motor milestones and language delay, optic atrophy and visual impairment with no seizures.\\nLaboratory evaluation revealed decreased circulating cortisol level 5.1 mg/dl at 8 a.m., other pituitary hormones were normal, high lactate levels turned out to be normal afterwards, abdominal ultrasonography detected bilateral undescended testes and magnetic resonance imaging of brain () revealed diffuse brain atrophy and periventricular demyelinating lesions. Electrocardiogram, bone scan, neonatal TORCH and basic metabolic panel were normal.\\nG-banded chromosome analysis revealed a normal male karyotype. Whole-exome sequencing (CentoXome GOLD\u00ae) supplementary revealed novel RAB3GAP1 gene mutation associated with autosomal recessive WARBM 1.\\nIn his every 3-month follow-ups, his neurodevelopment and muscular tone somewhat improved as a result of the physical therapy, but he showed intellectual disabilities.", "age": "[[7.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15216543': 1, '27311843': 1, '27081543': 1, '8249951': 1, '9733780': 1, '23420520': 1, '18286824': 1, '15696165': 1, '22768674': 1, '32477580': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
