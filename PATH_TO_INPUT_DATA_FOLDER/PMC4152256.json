The patient underwent a radical surgery for right buccal cancer, a transversal release of left OSF tissue, and right functional neck dissection. After ablation, the bilateral buccal defects were noted, including a left buccal mucosa defect (3\u00d74 cm2), and a right through-and-through cheek defects which involved the intraoral defect (6\u00d78 cm2) and the outer skin defect (4\u00d76 cm2) (). A free ALT musculocutaneous flap with three independent skin paddles was harvested (). The distal paddle was used to resurface the left mucosa defect, and two remaining paddles were chimeric to reconstruct the right full-thickness cheek defects. The donor site was closed primarily. All skin paddles of the ALT flap were survival, and the postoperative month opening of the patient was improved obviously ().", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21342385': 1, '23985639': 1, '23922263': 1, '19407623': 1, '20013586': 1, '14504524': 1, '12045540': 1, '30003220': 1, '15350021': 1, '26552247': 1, '24220477': 1, '11786790': 1, '19762132': 1, '8341740': 1, '11242347': 1, '23348258': 1, '19910852': 1, '18940491': 1, '20067722': 1, '11818816': 1, '22113843': 1, '21900855': 1, '18851934': 1, '10987464': 1, '34631580': 1, '23880013': 1, '30552758': 1, '20014446': 1, '23598761': 1, '9853941': 1, '21766330': 1, '18942652': 1, '32228569': 1, '5224185': 1, '6713155': 1, '9774005': 1, '18766068': 1, '25180680': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4152256-1': 2, '4152256-2': 2}"}
