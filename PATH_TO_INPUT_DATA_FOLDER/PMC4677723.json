It was an adenocarcinoma with Gleeson score of 4 + 3 = 7. His initial PSA was 6.7 mg/l. He was started on leuprorelin and bicalutamide. He has shown ongoing response to dual androgen blockade for nearly 4 years. Early in the same year, he presented with a painless swelling in his right breast. It was a 5 \u00d7 4 cm sized, hard, non-tender swelling at right breast, without any underlying bone tenderness or lymphadenopathy. Given his long-standing androgen deprivation therapy, the initial diagnosis was gynaecomastia. Ultrasound of the right breast revealed a lobulated retro-areolar lesion of the breast measuring 18 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 46 mm in diameter with well-defined margins, more in favour of atypical gynaecomastia. There was no abnormality on the right breast and no evidence of ipsilateral axillary or supraclavicular or neck lymphadenopathy. Core biopsy showed a malignant infiltrate with positive staining for PSA. The stains for CK7/CK20, oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, CD31, CD34, design and smooth muscle actin were negative. Surprisingly, these results were consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving the right breast.", "age": "[[80.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1706305': 1, '12872358': 1, '10836297': 1, '14680496': 1, '2720573': 1, '29980839': 1, '32095188': 2, '11473469': 1, '1394044': 1, '16285577': 1, '48413': 1, '8435719': 1, '20133250': 1, '1000485': 1, '24497788': 1, '3660162': 1, '10630761': 1, '32908762': 2, '26668576': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4677723-1': 2, '7011903-1': 1, '7450305-1': 1}"}
