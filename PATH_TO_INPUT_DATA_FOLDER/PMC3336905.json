Clinical examination demonstrated a large, hyperkeratotic, verrucous plaque with evidene of surrounding inflammation. A lesional skin biopsy was taken for hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) analysis, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies were also performed.\\nSkin biopsies for hematoxylin and eosin examination, as well as for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis were performed as previously described[].\\nExamination of the H & E tissue sections demonstrated epidermal hyperplasia with minimal cytologic atypia; pseudo-horn cyst formation was present. The base of the lesion displayed a relatively flat morphology. An infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes was also present within the papillary dermis, immediately subjacent to the lesion. Next, IHC stains were reviewed against linker for activated T cells (LAT), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), CD1a and CD68. These special stains displayed strong expression of these molecules within the previously described dermal inflammatory infiltrate. In addition, myeloid/histiocyte antigen was strongly, focally expressed by lesional keratinocytes ().", "age": "[[62.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9865449': 1, '23884103': 1, '20061054': 1, '11464731': 1, '10451644': 1, '19547994': 1, '19487162': 1, '29511456': 1, '19615020': 1, '154526': 1, '21152094': 1, '6444641': 1, '22540084': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
