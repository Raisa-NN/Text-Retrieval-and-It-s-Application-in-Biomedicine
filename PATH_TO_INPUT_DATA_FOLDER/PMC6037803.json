Her parents had a history of HP-induced gastric ulcer and had been treated a few years ago. However, medical evaluation of the child had not been performed. Routine laboratory examination revealed WBC 7,200/mm3, with polymorphonuclear cell 55.5%, hemoglobin level 14.0 g/dL, and platelet count 213\u00d7103/mm3. Electrolytes showed sodium levels 140 mmol/L, potassium 3.4 mmol/L and chloride 105 mmol/L. The total protein level was 8.0 g/dL, albumin 4.8 g/dL, calcium 9.8 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.0 mg/dL, cholesterol 163 mg/dL, glucose 83 mg/dL, BUN 6.4 mg/dL, creatinine 0.62 mg/dL, total bilirubin 0.97 mg/dL, AST 17 U/L, ALT 9 U/L, and CRP <0.8 mg/dL. UGI endoscopy showed chronic superficial gastritis of the stomach body, marked hyperemia and a short mucosal breakage in the distal esophagus. A longitudinal sessile polyp was noted in the GEJ area. The polyp was markedly congested and appeared like a hemangioma. She was negative for HP in the rapid urea test, stool HP antigen, and serum HP-specific immunoglobulin G tests. The pathological finding was sentinel polyp (). Polypectomy has not been performed yet. He is taking anti-reflux medicine, and no specific GI symptom presents. Follow-up UGI endoscopy would be performed in one year.", "age": "[[14.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'13489673': 1, '20431760': 1, '12454582': 1, '4019798': 1, '20675692': 1, '11873101': 1, '16189701': 1, '11688578': 1, '26289244': 1, '20177714': 1, '15758936': 1, '9841603': 1, '7117079': 1, '29992122': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6037803-1': 2, '6037803-2': 2, '6037803-3': 2}"}
