The patient was treated with the usual immunosuppressive regimen, comprising tacrolimus 2 mg b.i.d., mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg b.i.d., and prednisone 5 mg q.d. She further received atorvastatin due to concomitant dyslipidemia. A few months prior to admission, the dose of atorvastatin had been increased from 40 mg to 80 mg daily.\\nBlood tests at admission showed elevated levels of creatinine at 612 \u03bcmol/L (reference range 45\u201390 \u03bcmol/L), CK 18,934 U/L (50\u2013150 U/L), and myoglobin 11,718 \u03bcg/L (<75 \u03bcg/L). The symptoms and findings were consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury, and a regimen of forced alkaline diuresis was initiated. The condition was ascribed to the dose increase of atorvastatin and the possible interaction between this drug and tacrolimus, resulting in a reduced elimination of atorvastatin []. Consequently, atorvastatin was discontinued, and the dose of tacrolimus was reduced.\\nOn the seventh day of admission, elevated levels of hs-cTnT at 471 ng/L (99th percentile 14 ng/L) and CK isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) 162 \u03bcg/L (<3 \u03bcg/L) alongside increasing levels of CK 30,750 U/L and myoglobin 29,120 \u03bcg/L were found. Subsequent serial measurements showed increasing levels of cTnT, but decreasing levels of CK-MB, CK, myoglobin, and creatinine. Furthermore, the CK-MB/CK ratio increased from less than 1% initially to 12%. Due to the elevated cardiac biomarkers, serial electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and an endomyocardial biopsy were performed, which were all unremarkable. A peripheral muscle biopsy showed toxic myopathy, but no signs of inflammatory myositis. The patient was discharged after a total of four weeks. The statin treatment was not resumed, and she has not shown any signs of relapse since.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12190331': 1, '21962825': 1, '33183098': 1, '15941707': 1, '19833747': 1, '22922414': 1, '22105197': 1, '901098': 1, '10759487': 1, '11023449': 1, '11026100': 1, '22267244': 1, '23395074': 1, '32256093': 1, '15203259': 1, '22464266': 1, '33944852': 2, '20513610': 1, '26557852': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8142779-1': 1}"}
