His family history revealed that his father had severe hearing impairment. His medical history showed that he had allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis that had been treated until 3 months previously by an otolaryngologist.\\nThe patient initially visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of high fever, sore throat, and comorbid right cheek pain and mild swelling 6 weeks previously. A checkup at a dental clinic performed on the day before this initial visit revealed no abnormal findings. He showed clinical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis. A rapid antigen test for group A streptococcal infection showed positive results. The patient was diagnosed with streptococcal infection. Facial cellulitis was also suspected and treatment with amoxicillin helped improve symptoms. However, facial pain recurred within 4 weeks of the initial visit. The patient had mild tenderness and swelling of the right cheek. Head computed tomography revealed mild mucous membrane swelling and effusion in both sinuses ( left). Because recurrence of cellulitis with sinusitis was suspected, cefditoren pivoxil treatment was initiated. However, because the pain persisted, he visited our department.\\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormal findings except right cheek tenderness in the area that corresponded with the region supplied by the second branch of the trigeminal nerve (the maximally nerve). Although marked tenderness was evident, no point with hyperalgesia, where a light touch elicited severe pain, was observed. No facial paralysis or oral disorders were observed. Blood examination revealed no abnormal findings. Recurrence of sinusitis was suspected. Based on the physical examination and laboratory tests, the patient was clinically diagnosed with TN. Subsequently, oral clarithromycin administration was initiated for sinusitis that might have caused or exacerbated TN. However, administration of clarithromycin for 1 week was not effective for his facial pain. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no neurovascular compression ( right), which ruled out idiopathic, classical TN. During this time, we interviewed the patient on the nature of the right cheek pain. The patient described the pain as persistent, nagging, and dull in nature, which was completely different from the characteristics of pain associated with TN. Furthermore, trigger maneuvers failed to evoke pain. These evaluations excluded TN, and, thus, PIFP was diagnosed in week 2. Low dose of oral anticonvulsant carbamazepine (50 mg, twice a day) was initiated but was ceased due to general fatigue after the first administration.\\nAlthough the patient had been previously cheerful and greeted us when entering the examination room, he became gradually emotionless with headache and nausea in week 5. In addition, feeding difficulties and numbness in the arms occurred. An orthostatic tolerance test revealed no positive findings for orthostatic dysregulation. It became difficult for the patient to attend school in week 6. Because various somatic symptoms developed in addition to PIFP, psychological factors were suspected to be pertinent in the etiology of PIFP. During a detailed medical interview with the patient and his mother, several problems were revealed: the patient loved swimming but his swimming record had plateaued after fixing his swimming form even though he practiced vigorously at a top-class swimming club team. Moreover, because of a recent finger injury, he could not practice as intensely as he wanted; therefore, his competitive ability as a swimmer deteriorated. Furthermore, in early adolescence, the patient had difficulties in communication and his relationship with his father was strained due to the father's hearing impairment. Because these suggested that the circumstances surrounding him might have led to somatoform disorders, psychological counseling was ordered in week 6.\\nAs the patient faced, understood, and tolerated his psychological stress through counseling and psychotherapy twice a week, he gradually became expressive, worked up his appetite, and could attend school in week 10. Although sinusitis recurred at week 29, no facial pain developed. The patient received psychological counseling twice or thrice a month by this time. After 8 months, the frequency of counseling was reduced to once in 2 months. During this period, the patient's voice changed and became deeper at puberty. After confirming that facial pain as well as general malaise did not occur, even when the patient experienced distressing events, such as terminal examinations, counseling was ceased after 1 year and 8 months. After 3 years, the patient went on to high school and currently attends school cheerfully without any complaints and has resumed swimming.", "age": "[[11.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22168460': 1, '21960648': 1, '17149456': 1, '19874535': 1, '15025014': 1, '27325001': 1, '22078064': 1, '3808740': 1, '29368949': 1, '30881720': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
