She was taking prednisone 80 mg/d and received a dose of intravenous cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m2 4 weeks prior. She was thought to have Stye, discharged with warm compresses and outpatient ophthalmology appointment. One day later, she presented with increasing pain, discharge, and loss of vision in the left eye. Examination showed conjunctival chemosis, injection, and cloudy cornea (Figure B) with poor visibility of posterior structures on slit-lamp examination consistent with acute fulminant endophthalmitis. Ophthalmology performed emergent therapeutic penetrating Keratoplasty, corneal transplant, and pars-plana vitrectomy of the left eye. Cultures obtained from the eye were positive for Serratia marcescens and her vision subsequently improved with systemic and ocular antibiotics.\\nEndophthalmitis is a potentially vision-threatening infection that can result from exogenous or endogenous sources.\\nSerratia species are opportunistic gram-negative bacteria implicated in healthcare-associated infections, especially in immunocompromised patients., Our patient was treated with steroid and an alkylating agent for her kidney disease and had recurrent hospital admissions, both of which are risk factors for this infection. Moreover, nephrotic syndrome itself predisposes to infections.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28646999': 1, '29096629': 2, '17539795': 1, '29988598': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5668964-1': 1}"}
