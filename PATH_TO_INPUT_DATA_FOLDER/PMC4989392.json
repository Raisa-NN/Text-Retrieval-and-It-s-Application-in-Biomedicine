She could remove the lesions using gentle pulling with nails without any discomfort. She also complained of sparse hair in the axillae since puberty. Her medical or family history was unremarkable and did not take any regular medication. Examination revealed multiple dark-black keratotic follicular papules of the size of pinheads (0.5\u20131 mm) with sparse hair in the bilateral axillae [Figure and ]. Hair mount of an extracted plug revealed multiple-coiled vellus hairs embedded in keratinous material []. Further, dermoscopy of lesions revealed black dot-like structures, which were indeed tufts of light pigmented vellus hairs, tightly held together inside one follicular opening []. Histopathology of a lesion revealed two cystically dilated hair follicles with retention of small hair shafts and keratinous material within the dermis along with perifollicular mononuclear cell infiltrate []. Based on the above feature, a diagnosis of TS was made. The patient was advised 0.04% tretinoin cream at night for local application on the affected area without much relief.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23766613': 2, '17822507': 1, '9863280': 1, '21173334': 1, '7120439': 1, '23766618': 1, '21769241': 1, '12390185': 1, '33250734': 2, '25054768': 1, '27601861': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3681110-1': 1, '7670378-1': 1}"}
