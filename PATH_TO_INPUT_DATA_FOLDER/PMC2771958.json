She had had a tonic\u2013clonic seizure at 2 years of age and subsequently had poor feeding and progressive emaciation. By the age of five, she had developed decline in speech, unsteadiness of upper limbs, worsening of gait with posturing of the feet, and toe walking. Examination showed a short-statured, emaciated girl with a progeric face and microcephaly []. She had moderate mental retardation, relatively brisk deep tendon reflexes, upper limb incoordination, and foot dystonia. Fundoscopy showed a salt-and-pepper appearance, with macular thickening and pigment mottling. Routine blood tests were normal. Review of the brain CT scan done at 5 years of age showed bilateral basal ganglia calcifications []. A detailed skeletal survey showed a thickened calvarium [] and bilateral short fourth metatarsals. An MRI scan of the brain revealed generalized cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, with diffuse white matter hyperintensities [Figures and ], and hypointensities of the lentiform nuclei in T2-weighted images, which were consistent with calcifications []. Electroencephalogram and nerve conduction studies were normal.", "age": "[[9.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'10869141': 1, '1308368': 1, '11185579': 1, '16987878': 1, '16785726': 1, '19893654': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
