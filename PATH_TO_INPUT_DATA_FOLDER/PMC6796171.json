Percutaneous biopsy was compatible with angiomyosarcoma. Clinical examination showed no edema of the lower limbs. Neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (doxorubicin + dacarbazine followed by 50 Gy in 25 fractions) was performed. Post-treatment positron emission tomography scan imaging showed stable disease with partial metabolic response. Subsequently, the patient underwent radical resection of the tumor with right nephrectomy and infrarenal IVC resection. No IVC reconstruction was performed and at surgery, venous outflow through a collateral venous lumbar vein was noticed and preserved (, circle). No major perioperative complications occurred. Post-operative ultrasonography revealed normal lower limb venous pathways and the patient was discharged on post-operative day 11.
