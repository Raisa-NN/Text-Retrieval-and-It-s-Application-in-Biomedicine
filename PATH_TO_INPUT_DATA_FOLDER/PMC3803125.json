His first episode was 6 months prior to presentation when he slipped at the poolside and hit the back of his head. He had no loss of consciousness and got up on his own, looked pale and loopy, and passed out. Since then he has had 3 similar episodes where he has tripped or fallen, with or without bumping his head, he will stand up, look pale, and then pass out. He has had limb stiffening and his eyes seem to roll up. No apnea, jerking, and incontinence are associated with these episodes. He is otherwise a healthy boy with past history only significant for eczema. Family history is unremarkable. He did get a CT scan after his first episode, which was normal. An EEG was not performed as these were thought to be consistent with pallid form of breath holding spells. An EKG was performed to rule out cardiac etiology and CBC to rule out IDA.", "age": "[[17.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'2012641': 1, '8255846': 1, '7609753': 1, '11533339': 1, '2330120': 1, '2221968': 1, '23240534': 1, '22302459': 1, '3966048': 1, '9578980': 1, '9492090': 1, '6732278': 1, '3632016': 1, '30421679': 1, '20046299': 1, '22869831': 1, '10921515': 1, '9108865': 1, '9108866': 1, '9108851': 1, '2380815': 1, '23509162': 1, '2090594': 1, '11575615': 1, '8216538': 1, '1736640': 1, '8703234': 1, '13961431': 1, '4960778': 1, '11930276': 1, '5635617': 1, '11158456': 1, '24191206': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3803125-1': 2}"}
