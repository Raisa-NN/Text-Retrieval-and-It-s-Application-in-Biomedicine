The patient is a former smoker (quit five years before referral time) and has diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and oral sleep apnea. Resorption of alveolar bone and root deviation of the right lateral incisor was evident in dental X-ray () and in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging ( and ). In clinical examination, the tooth was vital and mobile class 3 according to Miller Classification. Incisional biopsy of the lesion was done () and revealed a plexiform ameloblastoma ( and ). Microscopically, a solid epithelial tumor was observed composed of interdigitating islands of odontogenic epithelium, with stellate reticulum-like areas, polarization of the basal nuclei and a dense matrix. The tumor cells were bland, lacking any sign of atypia. The final diagnosis was plexiform ameloblastoma.\\nHaving a finite diagnosis and under general anesthesia, the mass was resected with 1 cm free margins, resulting in marginal mandibulectomy (, and ). Following the resection, the patient received an Essix splint and gauze packing in order to allow secondary healing (). Post-operative recovery was fair, with normal inferior alveolar nerve function and no evidence of recurrence during two years follow-up. A vertical defect of 2 cm in the anterior mandibular alveolar ridge was stable during the follow-up period as could be seen clinically () and by CBCT ( and ).\\nReconstruction surgery was conducted by a submental transcutaneous \u201ctent pole\u201d approach in order to preserve oral soft tissue in the defect bed, maintain complete periosteum, and to separate the graft from oral cavity bacteria (). The bony defect was exposed () and an allogenic bone block was fitted () and fixated by 2 mm thick titanium plate and screws (). The block was covered with xenograft particles and cross-linked collagen membrane ( and ), and the soft tissue was sutured in layers (). Four months following reconstruction surgery, the plate was reflected intraorally (), and extraorally minimal submental scar was apparent (). Bone gain was evident by CBCT ( and ). Two dental implants inserted through the grafted bone, were covered by xenograft particles and cross-linked collagen membrane (, , and ).\\nTotal admission days were nine, three days for each operation\u2014resection, reconstruction and implants insertion. Medications prescribed post-operatively were penicillin-based antibiotics and painkillers such as paracetamol and dipyrone. No complications, such as bleeding, pus secretion, local heat and redness, were observed during admission days or during follow-ups.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29117045': 1, '21961003': 1, '29259970': 1, '30782457': 1, '18355584': 1, '18412579': 1, '28291849': 1, '17468035': 1, '11693963': 1, '9371107': 1, '23533415': 1, '28803739': 1, '17335361': 1, '17222535': 1, '19878171': 1, '32173876': 1, '30510586': 1, '22041016': 1, '8636167': 1, '21093239': 1, '12149731': 1, '20740672': 1, '26403412': 1, '31805680': 1, '20813557': 1, '10559853': 1, '32630080': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
