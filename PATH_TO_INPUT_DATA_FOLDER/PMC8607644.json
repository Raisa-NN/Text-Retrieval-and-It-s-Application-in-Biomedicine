Transthoracic echocardiography revealed abnormal drainage of the left pulmonary veins into the innominate vein, a large atrial septal defect, a small ventricular septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus. Computed tomography confirmed right lung agenesis (Fig. A\u2013D). Transthoracic echocardiography performed 2 days after birth revealed accelerated pulmonary venous flow between the vertical and the innominate vein. Progressive pulmonary venous obstruction necessitated surgical repair 3 days after birth.\\nA median sternotomy was performed to expose the heart, which was rotated counterclockwise owing to right lung agenesis. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established with ascending aortic perfusion and direct bicaval venous drainage. The patent ductus arteriosus was ligated. We performed pulmonary artery venting via the left pulmonary artery, and cardiac arrest was achieved using antegrade cardioplegia infusion. The pulmonary venous chamber was well visualized after counterclockwise rotation of the heart, and we selected the posterior approach intraoperatively. The vertical vein was ligated at its confluence with the innominate vein and was divided and incised toward the pulmonary venous chamber. The corresponding posterior wall of the left atrium was incised longitudinally toward the left atrial appendage. The pulmonary venous chamber containing the vertical vein was anastomosed to the left atrium using 7\u20130 PDS running sutures (Fig. A\u2013C). The atrial septal defect was directly closed. The aortic clamp time was 48 min. The left and right ventricular function was good with catecholamine support and nitric oxide administration. The heart was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass at a systemic pressure of 58/35 mmHg, pulmonary pressure of 34/13 mmHg, and central venous pressure of 6 mmHg, followed by sternal closure. Echocardiography and computed tomography confirmed absence of pulmonary venous obstruction, 1 year postoperatively (Fig. A, B).", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'24585319': 1, '30736816': 1, '22309948': 1, '24507772': 1, '17669789': 1, '28074825': 1, '34802434': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
