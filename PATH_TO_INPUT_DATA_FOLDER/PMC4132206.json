Abdominal CT revealed a 4-cm, solid, well-vascularized tumor on the head of the pancreas and adjacent to the superior mesentery vein. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging revealed abnormal uptake in the region of the pancreatic head. Although the patient had a normal level of 24-hour urinary norepinephrine excretion, primary functional pancreatic PGL was suspected due to his hypertension history. As a result, \u03b1-adrenergic receptor blockers were administered for 2 weeks prior to surgery. During surgery, the patient\u2019s blood pressure remained stable, and the tumor was resected successfully. Pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic PGL, and the tumor was positive for CgA and Syn, observed by performing immunohistochemical analysis. The patient received no subsequent adjuvant treatment, and his blood pressure was normal 3 months after surgery.", "age": "[[63.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18607119': 2, '26801079': 2, '17102106': 1, '11833676': 1, '8012074': 1, '30565068': 1, '33425308': 2, '30631823': 2, '21921779': 1, '34621864': 2, '26945413': 1, '26309372': 1, '17102115': 1, '19598001': 1, '34712035': 2, '18549892': 1, '33447574': 1, '18480742': 1, '25030833': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4132206-1': 2, '4722732-1': 1, '8515802-1': 1, '6319695-1': 1, '8462202-1': 1, '2627194-1': 1, '7756035-1': 1}"}
