Her past medical history was notable for remote history of left hemispheric glioma at 18 months treated with chemotherapy, radiation, and debulking, in remission since 2012 with subsequent epilepsy, global developmental delay, and obstructive sleep apnea without baseline need for respiratory support. On presentation, she was afebrile, tachypneic with oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 70% on room air, and minimally responsive to sternal rub. She appeared pale with delayed capillary refill, and breath sounds were coarse bilaterally with diminished breath sounds accompanied by severe retractions. Vital signs were notable for respiratory rate 29, heart rate 118, and pressure at 103/65 mmHg. The remainder of exam was unchanged from her baseline.", "age": "[[16.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'28328243': 1, '32392288': 1, '33689201': 1, '32074258': 1, '34452260': 1, '32087621': 1, '3644605': 1, '32224769': 1, '32377375': 1, '32316063': 1, '32649078': 1, '32258207': 1, '32335169': 1, '32187458': 1, '32405091': 1, '20959787': 1, '25030060': 1, '32315817': 1, '32265220': 1, '32320004': 1, '34022118': 1, '33062363': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
