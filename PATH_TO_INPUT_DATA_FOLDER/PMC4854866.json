The duration of the seizure was unknown given that his mother had last seen him at least 3\u20134 h prior to the event. The patient was noted by his mother to be febrile to 102.5\u00b0F prior to witnessed seizure activity; upon arrival of EMS, his temperature was 100.5\u00b0F. He was transported to a local hospital, seizures were acutely controlled with lorazepam and levetiracetam, and he was transitioned to his home zonisamide regimen. Initially, the patient was assumed to have Todd\u2019s paralysis, but when he failed to return to baseline, an MRI was performed on day 2 that showed thinned and truncated corpus collosum, diffusely increased T2/FLAIR signal intensity throughout the cortices of the left hemispheric gray matter with associated restriction diffusion, left hemispheric edema, 6.8 mm midline shift, effacement of the left ventricle, and dilation of the right ventricle. He was transferred to our tertiary hospital for neurosurgical management. At the time of admission, the patient was minimally responsive and displayed right-sided hemiparesis and gaze deviation, increased tone bilaterally, left papilledema, left orbital swelling, and asymmetric pupils who were reactive to light. vEEG was significant for diffuse slowing of the L hemisphere without epileptiform discharges.\\nThe patient\u2019s past medical history was significant for hypotonia, global developmental delays, febrile seizures, breath holding spells, small stature, and patent foramen ovale. The child was born at 41 weeks to non-consanguinous parents following an uncomplicated delivery. He was found to have IUGR, a two vessel cord, ear indentations, branchial cleft cyst, small phallus, and thrombocytopenia. The patient developed apnea and staring spells during the first week of life, and MRI performed on postnatal day 8 did not reveal structural abnormalities or infarcts. Subsequent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) demonstrated an asymmetrically small right transverse sinus that was patent. Karyotype and chromosome microarray analysis were performed, and the patient was found to carry an unbalanced 1;3 translocation that results in a 6.9-Mb deletion of the distal long arm of chromosome 1 containing 22 genes and an 8.6-Mb duplication of the distal short arm of chromosome 3 that contains 15 genes [46,XY,t(1;3)(q43;p26.1). arr[hg18] 1q43q44(240,287,612-247,190,999)x1,3p26.3p26.1(35,332-8,625,632)x3] (Table ). Suspecting an association with the patient\u2019s known chromosomal abnormality, the literature was reviewed, and another patient with similar symptoms and a smaller overlapping deletion involving 1q43q44 was identified () (Figure ).\\nRepeat MRI was performed on day 4 and showed worsening left-to-right subfalcine herniation anteriorly, patent arterial and venous supply, and left-sided diffusion restriction (Figure ). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) showed associated significant increase in lactate within the left cerebral hemisphere with decreased N-acetylaspartic acid, choline, and creatinine. A smaller but elevated lactate signal was observed in the right hemisphere. Due to worsening left hemispheric edema, the patient was started on intravenous mannitol on the third day of admission and transitioned to enteral sodium chloride 24 h later. Head CT on the sixth day of admission indicated that hemispheric swelling had stabilized, and repeat MRI/MRS on day 8 was essentially unchanged. Laboratory testing on this day revealed decreased total and free carnitine levels (14 and 16 nmol/mL, respectively); venous lactate was within normal limits (0.8 mmol/L). Given the patient\u2019s history, clinical presentation, and MRI findings, he was diagnosed with hemiconvulsion\u2013hemiplegia\u2013epilepsy syndrome (HHE). The patient was seen in clinic approximately 2 months later after the completion of inpatient rehabilitation and displayed dense right hemiparesis with the ability to sit alone without support. His mother reported that his vocalizations and cognitive function had returned to baseline, and he was attempting to crawl again. At this time, the patient had not experienced a seizure since the inciting event.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19563349': 1, '23125284': 1, '15275707': 1, '16514228': 1, '22678713': 1, '22341151': 1, '10580881': 1, '24403053': 1, '22753451': 1, '17875361': 1, '30455564': 1, '6956495': 1, '536746': 1, '17350294': 1, '11913562': 1, '20004859': 1, '16288674': 1, '16876973': 1, '12503653': 1, '24214579': 1, '21824570': 1, '34120294': 1, '21800092': 1, '33531945': 2, '27199890': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7847093-1': 1, '7847093-2': 1, '7847093-3': 1, '7847093-4': 1}"}
