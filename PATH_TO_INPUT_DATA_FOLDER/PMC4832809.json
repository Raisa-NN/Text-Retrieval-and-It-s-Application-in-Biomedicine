At the time of tumor resection, the orbit was lined with a split-thickness skin graft taken from the thigh. The patient did not receive pre- or post-operative radiation treatment.\\nDuring the examination, the patient was concerned with his facial disfigurement and wanted an acceptable solution as early as possible. Various prosthetic treatment modalities ranging from acrylic resin orbital prosthesis to implant retained silicone prostheses were explained and discussed with the patient. Due to socioeconomic reasons, the patient chose orbital prosthesis made of acrylic resin. The fabrication of PMMA resin orbital prosthesis was planned, and it was decided to use available anatomic undercuts to retain the prosthesis.", "age": "[[91.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24358510': 1, '23204739': 1, '19141150': 1, '29430146': 2, '18289132': 1, '24881615': 1, '9553884': 1, '8957784': 1, '31037051': 1, '11514811': 1, '6943341': 1, '11791267': 1, '4570916': 1, '6927911': 1, '27134437': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5799973-1': 1}"}
