He was originally treated by his primary care physician with topical antifungal cream for a presumed tinea infection without improvement. He presented to the dermatology clinic where multiple biopsies over time were nondiagnostic, revealing nonspecific pathologic diagnoses such as spongiotic dermatitis and psoriasiform dermatitis. He failed to improve after many months of high dose topical steroids and a short course of oral methotrexate.\\nApproximately one month after methotrexate was discontinued, the patient developed violaceus and erythematous juicy nodules on the cheeks, trunk, and all four extremities (). Differential diagnosis included deep fungal infection, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, CTCL, and Kaposi's sarcoma. A biopsy of a large tumor on the right shin was performed and revealed a diffuse infiltrate of atypical inflammatory cells, without epidermotropism, most consistent with MF with large cell transformation. Over the following months, the development of tumors quickly progressed, and many became ulcerated (). At this point tumors developed on the dorsal surface of the tongue (). At this time, biopsies of the right thigh showed epidermotropism ().", "age": "[[72.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25721994': 1, '16488298': 1, '17707150': 1, '28560304': 1, '29700722': 1, '26837196': 1, '16120144': 1, '24438970': 1, '30581634': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
