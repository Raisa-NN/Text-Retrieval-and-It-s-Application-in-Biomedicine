He was not able to stand after the trauma. He was treated by a traditional bone setter with a topical medication without any manipulation or splinting. He started walking after 1.5 months, using a stick.\\nThree months later, he presented with a painful left hip and an inability to bear weight on the left lower limb. On examination, both his anterior superior iliac spines were at the same level. The left lower limb was in flexion, neutral rotation, and neutral in abduction/adduction plane. The only available movement was flexion from 30\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.\\nRoentgenogram [] and 3D computed tomography [] confirmed the plane of dislocation. The femoral head was lying inferior to and in the same plane of acetabulum, within the pelvic cavity []. There was an indentation over the superolateral half of femoral head, with no fracture in the femur. Correspondingly, there was a defect in the inferior aspect of medial wall of acetabulum which was confirmed on 3D subtraction image []. However, there was no corresponding fracture fragment found in the images.\\nThe patient was operated and total hip replacement was done through a posterior approach. Fibrous tissue covering the acetabulum was cleared. The head was lying inferior to the acetabulum and was found within the pelvis in a pseudocapsule. The head was delivered out by flexion, abduction, internal rotation, and lateral pull. There was a smooth indentation over the superolateral half of femoral head. The transverse acetabular ligament was found torn. The acetabulum was also found intact except for a small defect in the inferior aspect of its medial wall. Cemented total hp replacement was done using Exeter total hip system (Howmedica Inc.).\\nPostoperative roentgenogram revealed well-placed components with excess cement lying in the pseudocapsule within the pelvis []. The patient started walking with support on the second postoperative day. He was able to do active straight leg raising and abduction against gravity by the second week. At the 2 years follow-up, the patient was walking unaided with a stable and pain-free hip.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29897869': 1, '2120934': 1, '7384446': 1, '3571320': 1, '759430': 1, '5057107': 1, '14516047': 1, '31915558': 2, '20419014': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6930723-1': 1}"}
