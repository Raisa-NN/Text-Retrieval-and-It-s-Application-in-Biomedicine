The patient complained of excessive gagging along with the sensation of \"something sticking in his throat\". There was no history of nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. On examination he was haemodynamically stable with no evidence of airway compromise, respiratory distress or abdominal tenderness. An ENT assessment was normal suggesting passage of the foreign body into the oesophagus.\\nA plain abdominal x-ray demonstrated the presence of a sharp foreign body overlying the pyloric region at the level of the L1 vertebral body (Figure ). An erect chest x-ray was normal. Urgent oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy failed to retrieve the foreign body.\\nThe patient was treated conservatively and kept nil by mouth for 24-hours with regular observations. He remained well the following day with no clinical evidence of intestinal obstruction or perforation. Normal diet was commenced. Serial abdominal X-rays showed passage of the foreign body through the hepatic flexure on day-2 (Figure ) and complete passage through the gastrointestinal tract by day three (Figure ). He was subsequently discharged with no further follow-up.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23960513': 1, '8798356': 1, '17907303': 1, '18711632': 1, '18479380': 1, '30112324': 2, '8650970': 1, '14765755': 1, '12023005': 1, '18543694': 1, '12024131': 1, '21879431': 1, '18005196': 1, '25452923': 1, '25206186': 2, '18574418': 1, '9472755': 1, '19192270': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6069660-1': 1, '6069660-2': 1, '4034636-1': 1}"}
