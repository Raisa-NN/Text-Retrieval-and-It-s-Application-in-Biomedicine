After the soft tissue on the posterior part of the C1 and the lamina and spinous process of the C2 was completely removed, the surgeons placed the RPDTs on the corresponding bony surfaces and drilled the entry points and trajectories under the navigation of the RPDTs (Figures -). After all the screws were inserted, the C1 and C2 were separated from the craniocervical cadaver specimen to assess the screw positions. The postoperative outcomes showed that the positions of all the screws were optimal and were classified as grade 1 (Figures \u2013).", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'11707712': 1, '19517142': 1, '23563342': 1, '27160327': 1, '23429321': 1, '26165477': 1, '33558972': 1, '16371915': 1, '22531473': 1, '17538356': 1, '21838535': 1, '21289565': 1, '12195062': 1, '11426150': 1, '25518033': 1, '20010385': 1, '25584951': 1, '17051397': 1, '27454537': 1, '24785974': 1, '15739530': 1, '24005997': 1, '19050571': 1, '19856190': 1, '24810817': 1, '24525747': 1, '22614268': 1, '28004004': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5149599-1': 2}"}
