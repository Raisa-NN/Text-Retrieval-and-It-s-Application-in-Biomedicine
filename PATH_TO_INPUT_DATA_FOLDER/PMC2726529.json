There was no history of trauma and he was otherwise fit and well. On examination, he had a tender mass on the volar aspect of the metacarpophalangeal joint as he actively flexed and extended the ring finger, and there was a small, palpable lump overlying the fourth metacarpophalangeal joint.\\nA diagnosis of trigger finger was made; however, the palpable lump was significantly larger than usually found with a Notta's nodule. An X-ray of the right hand was unremarkable and an ultrasound scan revealed an elliptical soft tissue mass associated with the flexor tendons and A1 pulley.\\nAt surgical exploration under general anaesthesia, a circumscribed soft tissue mass, 1.5 cm in diameter, was found infiltrating the A1 pulley and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) (Figure ). The lesion was excised en masse, protecting the neurovascular bundle, and the postoperative course was uneventful. At six-week follow-up the wound had healed and the patient reported that the painful locking and clicking had completely resolved. The period of follow-up is now over 18 months and he has returned to his normal work and leisure activities without any further problems with the finger.\\nHistological examination of the excised tumour revealed a spindle-celled stromal lesion with mucinous degeneration; and with cells that were positive for SMAC (smooth muscle actin) on immunohistochemical analysis. These findings were consistent with a leiomyoma.", "age": "[[39.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'13806476': 1, '9265801': 1, '3001175': 1, '16106517': 1, '1989029': 1, '19830163': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
