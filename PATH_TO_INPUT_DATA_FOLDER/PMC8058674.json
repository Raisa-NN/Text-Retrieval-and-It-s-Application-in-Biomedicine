His initial dentist referred the boy to our clinic for an incompletely formed root associated with a large radiolucency.\\nAny trauma of the tooth was denied by his parents.\\nHis parents denied any personal and family history.\\nThe clinical signs were described as follows. Tooth # 45 was free of caries, but there was a sign of a fractured tubercle of DE on the occlusal surface. The tooth mobility was grade I, and there was a gingival fistula on the buccal side. The pyogenic fluids flowed out of the fistula under palpation (Figure ). Tooth percussion was sensitive. The probing depths of the affected tooth were within a normal range.\\nInitial panoramic radiography at his first visit showed that the root of tooth # 45 was fractured. A separated root apex was found apically under the main root and was almost completely formed. The main root remained immature with a thin root wall and was associated with a large radiolucency. However, the root of tooth # 35 was not erupted, and the second primary molar remained. The root development was graded as Nolla 8 (Figure ).", "age": "[[11.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1069586': 1, '1054469': 1, '5255742': 1, '18215674': 1, '12656869': 1, '1603555': 1, '32209245': 1, '18498881': 1, '1521505': 1, '20416419': 1, '29777616': 1, '2133316': 1, '27726882': 1, '10654438': 1, '21496677': 1, '234007': 1, '3481256': 1, '32221422': 1, '33969081': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
