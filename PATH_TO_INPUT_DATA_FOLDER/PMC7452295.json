He has no other medical conditions or psychiatric history. Alopecia totalis developed in our patient when he was approximately 40 years of age.\\nAt an unspecified interval after this development, generalized vitiligo affecting the face, abdomen, and extremities developed. Several years after the onset of vitiligo, pruritus developed. It was then that the patient presented to our department. PN diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. Routine laboratory workup and radiologic examinations including a chest radiograph and abdominal ultrasound scan found no secondary cause of his pruritus.\\nThe patient had severe pruritus. Throughout the course of the condition, he had received various treatments for PN, initially topical steroids, then tacrolimus and phototherapy, and finally oral methotrexate with varying doses. He was not interested in treating his vitiligo or alopecia. He is currently being treated with methotrexate, 15 mg weekly, with an unsatisfactory effect on his pruritus. Currently, he is not using any topical therapy, emollients, or sun protection.\\nIt was not until the most recent clinic visit that it was noticed that all PN nodules occurred in vitiliginous patches (). His vitiligo has followed a stable course throughout the years. He has no facial or genital PN but does have vitiligo at these sites. He has no pruritus or PN on nonvitiliginous skin.", "age": "[[82.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'15140065': 1, '16197418': 1, '15109273': 1, '34283349': 1, '31131483': 1, '13570695': 1, '19577331': 1, '31293565': 1, '32875033': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
