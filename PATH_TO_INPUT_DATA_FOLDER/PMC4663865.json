Clinical examination was unremarkable and initial investigations showed a slightly raised total leucocyte count-11400/cmm and a normal X-ray Chest. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest showed patchy infiltrates in the lung periphery and left hilar lymphadenopathy [Figures and ]. He was referred to our unit for a bronchoscopy and EBUS evaluation of the left hilar lymph node. The bronchoscopy did not reveal any abnormality and we proceeded to the EBUS examination. During the routine initial examination of all the lymph nodal stations it was found that besides a left hilar node there was a large hyperechoeic shadow occupying the lumen of the main pulmonary artery and another similar opacity though smaller shadow, in the right pulmonary artery [Figures and ]. The procedure was completed, by taking transbronchial needle aspirations from the left hilar node. It was assumed that the intravascular opacities were due to thrombi and this was immediately confirmed by performing a CT pulmonary angiography where filling defects were seen in the pulmonary artery and its branches [Figures -].\\nThe patient was put on anticoagulants and made an uneventful recovery. The aspiration from the lymph node showed only lymphoid cells and the bronchial washings did not reveal acid-fast bacilli or any other significant infection. Thus, the EBUS procedure was very helpful in making an important diagnosis, which was otherwise unsuspected.", "age": "[[21.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29312744': 1, '18978147': 1, '21292379': 1, '30745744': 1, '34660151': 2, '20863981': 1, '19065053': 1, '26664168': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8516013-1': 1}"}
