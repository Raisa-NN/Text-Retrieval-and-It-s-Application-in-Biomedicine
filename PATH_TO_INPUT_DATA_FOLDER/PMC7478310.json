She was referred for 99mTc-MDP bone scan [], which was showed increased tracer uptake in multiple joints, likely favoring metabolic bone disease/osteomalacia. Her laboratory tests revealed normal calcium; however, she had hypophosphatemia (1.2 mg/dl).\\nSubsequently, on clinical suspicion of occult malignancy, she was referred for whole-body 18F-FDG PET-CT scan. The maximum intensity projection image [] showed fairly physiological distribution with faint increased uptake in the right proximal thigh. The axial image and coronal images [Figure and ] revealed low-grade FDG uptake in soft tissue nodular lesion in the proximal right thigh, just lateral to femoral vessels in anteromedial aspect of infratrochantric region. Biopsy of the lesion confirmed diagnosis of mesenchymal tumor, which was then surgically excised. Thereafter, the patient showed dramatic improvement within a month.", "age": "[[47.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'24900011': 1, '23295468': 1, '15777669': 1, '17652663': 1, '9988077': 1, '11705323': 1, '10594133': 1, '22747833': 2, '32939204': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3514377-1': 1}"}
