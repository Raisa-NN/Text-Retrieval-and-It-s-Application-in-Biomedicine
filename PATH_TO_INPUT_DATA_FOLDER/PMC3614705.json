He had no past history of alcoholic consumption, hepatitis A or B infection, and autoimmunity. The HCV genotype and circulating HCV RNA were 2a and at 220 KIU/ml, respectively. We successfully conducted a interferon alfacon-1 (genetical recombination) 1800 \u00d7 104 IU/day for 2 weeks and subsequently three times a week for 6 months. However, 4 months after the therapy had ended, a recurrence was observed (Figure ). Then, he underwent a more moderate IFN therapy (IFN-alpha 3 MU s.c. once weekly) to obtain a minimum of a biochemical remission. A biochemical remission was achieved after 3 months without any side effects. After 13 months, we changed the IFN to P-IFN 90 \u03bcg s.c. once a week and after that, his HCV RNA suddenly disappeared. We tried to gradually reduce the frequency of injections, which could be reduced to once every two months at the present time. Now, his status of liver disease is still non-cirrhosis.", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17565465': 1, '11583749': 1, '15785092': 1, '23675097': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3614705-1': 2}"}
