Physical examination was unremarkable. On transthoracic echocardiography, cystic mass was noted in the left ventricular wall. Diagnostic coronary angiography and fluoroscopy demonstrated normal epicardial coronary arteries and two different masses with calcified contours. () Serological test was negative for echinococcal disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed cystic lesions, in the left ventricular posterolateral wall protruding into the lumen and right ventricular free wall expanding to apical segment (). Abdominal ultrasonography and thorax CT revealed no any extracardiac cyst. The diagnosis of isolated cardiac hydatosis was made. After albendazole treatment for four weeks, surgery was performed for excision of the cyst. During the operation, rupture of the cyst was noted. The diagnosis of cardiac hydatid cyst was confirmed by pathological examination. During a six-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, with no cystic appearance on transthoracic echocardiography.", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10934311': 1, '19438781': 1, '28218769': 1, '19633552': 1, '24757641': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
