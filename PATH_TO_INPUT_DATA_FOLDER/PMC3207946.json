A 30-year-old woman at 32 weeks of gestation was admitted because of the acute onset of severe chest pain and dyspnea. Her chest x-ray revealed an enlarged heart shadow and widening of the mediastinum. Echocardiography revealed BAVD (Figure ) with moderate aortic stenosis and regurgitation, a dilated aortic root measuring 4.6 cm in diameter, and an acute aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta, which was also verified by a computed tomography arteriogram (Figure ).\\nThese two patients had a negative history of vascular events, high blood pressure, and previous vascular surgery. Under general anesthesia, the cardiopulmonary bypass was built by draining from right atrium and perfusion into the femoral artery or axillary artery. Cesarean section was performed immediately followed by Bentall procedure. After 24 hours of a regular intensive care unit (ICU) postoperative period, the patients were transferred to the ward and then discharged on the 7th postoperative day.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21747050': 1, '23275924': 2, '9070139': 1, '12842575': 1, '27366366': 1, '15681576': 1, '4225694': 1, '30787692': 2, '7503207': 1, '22547559': 1, '11323484': 1, '23166221': 1, '23843107': 1, '12056729': 1, '23494023': 1, '9386702': 1, '21999207': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3207946-1': 2, '6298258-1': 1, '3530726-1': 1}"}
