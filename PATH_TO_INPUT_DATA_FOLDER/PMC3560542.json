He had an uncomplicated post-transplant period on Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. After 6 months he developed fever and abnormal liver function tests. His laboratory data are shown in table-1. Imaging studies didn't show any focal lesion. Liver biopsy was done which showed portal infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells with irregular nuclear border (Fig-1b) which were positive with CD 20 and negative with CD3, and CD30.Although LMP-1 by immunohistochemistry was negative but PCR for EBV was positive in the liver tissue. The immunosuppressive drugs were reduced, but he remained febrile and after about 2 weeks he developed cervical lymphadenopathy, lymph node biopsy showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma, so CHOP regimen plus Retuximab was started. After a couple of weeks, the enlarged lymph nodes were disappeared and now after 6 months, he is alive and symptom-free. Imaging studies including ultrasonography failed to show significant finding, and imaging of the transplanted liver is normal.", "age": "[[16.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9136517': 1, '14963742': 1, '16984848': 1, '16758110': 1, '17337924': 1, '9831003': 1, '15309588': 1, '29072050': 1, '17416884': 1, '14748572': 1, '24032049': 1, '9728384': 1, '18497499': 1, '28299022': 1, '17621008': 1, '17711732': 1, '18062462': 1, '17652921': 1, '23396650': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3560542-1': 2}"}
