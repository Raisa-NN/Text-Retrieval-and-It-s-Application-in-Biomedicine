He benefited from resection of the nodule. Four months later, the mass recurred at the same location, gradually increased in volume and fistulated to his skin, causing a total loss of function of his right arm. A physical examination revealed a firm and deeply adhering mass of 20\u00d710cm, which was painful with inflammatory signs. An X-ray of his arm showed no bone damage or soft tissue calcifications (Figure ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a heterogeneous tumor process in the anterior face of his right forearm measuring 13.7\u00d75.5cm, isosignal at T1, slightly hypersignal at T2, including vascular structures (Figure ). As a result, a surgical biopsy was performed.\\nOn microscopic examination, it was a malignant tumor proliferation, made of both cellular and loose areas. The neoplastic cells were epithelioid, plasmacytoid and spindle (Figure a, b and c). They have frankly malignant cytomorphology with nuclear pleomorphism and vesicular chromatin (Figure d). Mitoses were numerous (Figure d), estimated at 10 mitoses per 10 high-power fields. The matrix was myxoid, with metaplastic bone (Figure ). Areas of necrosis were observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining with pancytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and S-100 (Figure ). The tumor was immunonegative for desmin, smooth muscle actin and CD34. A diagnosis of malignant myoepithelioma was established. EWSR1 gene rearrangement research was non-contributory.\\nGiven the locally advanced stage of the disease, an amputation of the limb was performed. An examination revealed the presence of a very limited and encapsulated nodule within the ME carcinoma. Neoplastic cells were epithelioid without cytological atypia, realizing myoepithelioma (Figure ).", "age": "[[84.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'8990137': 1, '7571084': 1, '16510337': 1, '12960802': 1, '22154050': 1, '31879796': 1, '21393045': 1, '17498593': 1, '27446369': 1, '34434330': 2, '20815032': 1, '25253093': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8383676-1': 1}"}
