He was not symptomatic at presentation and was using anti-coagulants for cardiovascular disease. Visual acuity was 6/6 both eyes (OU). Intra-ocular pressure and anterior segment were normal OU. OD had a finger like area of macular whitening sparing the fovea. This area corresponded to the vascular bed of a clinically appearing cilio-retinal artery (cilio-RA) []. However, on fluorescein angiography, the artery filled along with branches of central RA (CRA) [Fig. and ]. Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) showed inner and middle retinal edema with shadowing of underlying layers []. The superficial capillary plexus was less affected on SS-OCT angiography (SS-OCTA). The deeper plexus revealed reduced capillary density nasal to the fovea, with an adjacent hypo-dense capillary nonperfusion area [Figure and ]. A diagnosis of occlusion of intra-neural branch of CRA was made.", "age": "[[56.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22553672': 1, '14188308': 1, '26457398': 1, '29785999': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
