The pathological study of the liver specimen revealed multiple well-differentiated HCC with a major nodule of 6,6 cm in diameter without vascular invasion (T3aN0M0). After LT the patient received tacrolimus and mycophenolate as immunosuppression regimen. During follow-up, he never experienced HCV recurrence. In addition, any episodes of rejection or opportunistic infections needing specific treatment were detected.\\nFollow-up images and tumoral markers showed no tumoral recurrence until 36 months after LT when he was admitted to our hospital presenting with a 2 cm in diameter bleeding oral mass localized in the retromolar trigonum (). The bleeding stopped by local compression, and a biopsy of the lesion was taken. The pathological study of the oral lesion demonstrated mucosal infiltration by a poor-differentiated carcinoma (Figures and ). Immunohistochemistry was performed and the lesion was positive for Heppar 1 and CD34 (). With the morphological features and the immunohistochemical profile the oral lesion was diagnosed as a metastatic HCC.\\nAfter diagnosing the oral lesion as a metastatic HCC a PET-CT was performed showing no other metastatic disease elsewhere. Alpha-fetoprotein levels were still normal. His immunosuppression was switched to sirolimus, and he started treatment with sorafenib 400 mg/12 hs.", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29369168': 1, '18958569': 1, '25821363': 2, '18581506': 1, '1663145': 1, '27891304': 1, '33072203': 1, '9798231': 1, '23213609': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4374307-1': 1}"}
