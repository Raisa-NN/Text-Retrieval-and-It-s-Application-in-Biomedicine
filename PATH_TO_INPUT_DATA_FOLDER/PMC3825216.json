On clinical and radiographic examination a diagnosis of Ellis Class VI fracture was established i.r.t 12 (Figures and ).\\nThe treatment protocol was similar to that of Case 1, where rigid splinting was carried out using orthodontic braided wire and flowable composite for a period of 6 weeks ().\\nEndodontic treatment began two weeks after splinting of teeth, where tooth vitality was checked indicating delayed response, access preparation and pulp extirpation was carried out, and working length was determined (). Due to the bayonet configuration of the root, complete instrumentation was done using hand Ni-Ti files by step back technique; following this, complete obturation () was carried out using ZOE sealer and lateral condensation of gutta-percha. And similar intraradicular splinting was carried out like in Case 1 using white MTA (Proroot, Dentsply, Germany) ().\\nImmediate postop evaluation revealed complete resolution of tooth mobility to physiological limits and remaining teeth showed a vital response ().", "age": "[[26.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'14977301': 1, '21404971': 1, '19639089': 1, '15355385': 1, '17367451': 1, '18721336': 1, '16475376': 1, '9028190': 1, '10022786': 1, '24282648': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3825216-1': 2}"}
