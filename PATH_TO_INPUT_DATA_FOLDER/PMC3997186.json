He had no systemic and lower urinary tract symptoms and was admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University for further examinations. The patient started with a high fever (38.5 to 41.0\u00b0C). His first WBC count was 26.9 \u00d7 109/L. A tender, palpable right flank mass with an acute percussion pain was detected during a physical examination. His CT scan showed a solid hypo dense lesion in the right kidney measuring 7 \u00d7 10 cm (Figure B). Meanwhile, a right renal tumor was identified with no evidence of extra-renal extension or distant metastases. An open right radical nephrectomy was performed via a supra-11th rib right flank incision. The tumor was pathologically diagnosed as SRCC (Figure B). Postoperative recovery was uncomplicated and white blood cell decreased gradually to the normal range. However, two weeks later after the patient was discharged, he presented with a high fever again once more. Even though broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered without delay, the increasing speed of the WBC count was dramatic (Figure B). Leukemoid reaction was established and the patient died of multiple organ failure less than 50 days after the operation.", "age": "[[56.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19590824': 1, '26483880': 1, '19786665': 1, '22166824': 1, '22132887': 1, '2380139': 1, '16962944': 1, '31236397': 2, '22812671': 2, '17095843': 1, '7542171': 1, '11743277': 1, '9292137': 1, '23242713': 1, '19942969': 1, '11224597': 1, '1376442': 1, '12717246': 1, '24745762': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3997186-1': 2, '3459806-1': 1, '6580346-1': 1}"}
