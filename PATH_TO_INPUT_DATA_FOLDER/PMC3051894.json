According to the history, the patient, suffering from bilateral knee pain not responding to analgesics, had followed the recommendation of a neighbor; she ground a plant found growing in the mountains and applied it to both knees. Despite the pain, she had not unfurled the bandages for 2 days, and after removing the poultices, she had noticed burn wounds. On the same day, the patient presented to our emergency unit. Her medical history revealed no chronic disease except hypertension. On physical examination, second-degree burns on the anterior aspect of both knees were observed. After performing debridement on the first day of admission, the injuries were cleaned with chlorhexidine scrub and topical silver sulfadiazine cream. By the end of the 10th day, the patient had recovered completely. The plant specimens were identical with those in the first two cases.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'16172054': 1, '17084031': 1, '18844703': 1, '12358554': 1, '22666267': 2, '26922695': 1, '17062085': 1, '17868226': 1, '9915212': 1, '31180380': 2, '17624679': 1, '15932581': 1, '26123646': 1, '11217994': 1, '29362637': 1, '21408003': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3051894-1': 2, '3051894-2': 2, '6526994-1': 1, '6526994-2': 1, '6526994-3': 1, '3362821-1': 1}"}
