There was a history of irritability and fever a week before presenting to us. On examination, the patient was febrile (temp, 100\u00b0F) with tachycardia (pulse 140/min) and dehydrated. Abdomen was distended with visible bowel loops. A mass was palpable in the RIF with tenderness and guarding in the lower abdomen. A digital rectal examination yielded empty rectum. X-ray abdomen erect showed a complete cut-off sign indicating intestinal obstruction. Ultrasound abdomen depicted excessive gaseous shadows in the lower abdomen. Laboratory test showed Hb 10g/dl and WBC count of 22000 with 80% of neutrophils. A diagnosis of appendicular mass/abscess with bowel obstruction was made. The patient was optimized for operation. At operation, the vermiform appendix was found encircling a loop of terminal ileum like a band. The tip of appendix was adherent with the cecum; the entrapped ileum was gangrenous (Fig. 1, 2). The tip of ileum which was inflamed freed from the cecum and appendectomy performed. The gangrenous ileum was resected and an ileostomy formed 5cm proximal to ileocecal valve. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient is on our follow-up for ileostomy reversal.", "age": "[[2.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12447596': 1, '21912069': 1, '4517804': 1, '26023444': 2, '17875135': 1, '16329768': 1, '25374796': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4420372-1': 1}"}
