Her medical history included tensional headaches and SPMS, which was diagnosed at age 14. She endorsed using sporadic acetaminophen. She failed multiple therapies including interferon \u03b2-1b (at age 17) and fingolimod (at age 29). One year prior to admission, she received a cycle of alemtuzumab (12 mg/day for 5 days) with subsequent improvement of her neurological symptoms over the following months. Upon evaluation, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 168/95 mmHg, heart rate 77 bpm, respiratory rate 18 rpm, and temperature 36.9 \u00b0C (98.5 \u00b0F). On examination, she had scanning speech, multidirectional nystagmus, and mild bilateral edema to the ankle.\\nHer complete blood count was within normal limits, with no lymphopenia (white blood cell count: 9.4 \u00d7 109 cells/mL, lymphocyte %: 16.5). Basic biochemistry was remarkable for creatinine (Cr) at 2 mg/dL (reference range: 0.6 \u2013 1.2 mg/dL, baseline Cr: 0.8 mg/dL), and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 37 mg/dL. Urine studies were relevant for proteinuria (860 mg/24h), hematuria, and leukocyturia with a normal urinary immune-fixation pattern. No red blood cell casts were noted on microscopy. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA, 1 : 320, homogeneous pattern), perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA, < 1 : 20), and cytoplasmic antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA, > 1 : 640) were detected on the autoimmune work-up. Additional testing included: Smith antibodies: 8 (reference: 0 \u2013 19 units), glomerular basement membrane antibodies: 6 (reference: 0 \u2013 20 units), complement C3: 139 (reference: 82 \u2013 193 mg/dL), complement C4: 44 (reference: 15 \u2013 57 mg/dL), complement CH50: 55 (reference: 40 \u2013 60 U/mL), cryoglobulins (quantitative analysis): negative, and double string DNA antibodies: 24 (reference: 0 \u2013 29 IU/mL). She was noted to have autoimmune hypothyroidism with evidence of antibodies against thyroglobulin (1.9 IU/mL, reference: 0 \u2013 0.9 IU/mL) and antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (43 IU/mL, 0 \u2013 34 IU/mL). Additional studies showed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) at 133.15 mIU/mL (reference range: 0.4 \u2013 4.5 mIU/mL), free T3: 1.3 pg/mL (reference range: 1.7 \u2013 3.7 pg/mL) and free T4: 0.5 ng/mL (reference range: 0.7 \u2013 1.5 ng/mL).\\nOn further review, it was noticed that her thyroid and renal dysfunction followed the slow recovery of her T-helper counts, which occurred ~ 10 months after her initial round of alemtuzumab (). Furthermore, a markedly high CD8+/CD4+ ratio was noticed during her recovering process. A kidney biopsy was performed due to the high suspicion of an underlying glomerulonephritis (GN) in the setting of immune reconstitution, which had findings consistent with pauci-immune GN with a focal and segmental lesion (). No foot process effacement was noticed on electron microscopy. The patient was initially treated with a 5-day course of IV methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg) and transitioned to rituximab, 500 mg/m2/dose, 2 infusions/month, every 6 months for the management of SPMS, concurrent thyroid dysfunction and GN. Her kidney function improved significantly, with a new baseline Cr at 0.9 mg/dL (). There was no evidence of proteinuria or hematuria on repeated urinalysis. Her thyroid function gradually improved (TSH: 4.48 mIU/mL, free T4: 1.2 ng/mL). Furthermore, her MS remained controlled with rituximab, with no clinical or radiographic progression at 18 months follow-up.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23634277': 1, '23934027': 1, '29854982': 1, '23685786': 1, '22056965': 1, '28283679': 1, '25877456': 1, '16044212': 1, '18946064': 1, '26170177': 1, '18703487': 1, '15090452': 1, '32905274': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
