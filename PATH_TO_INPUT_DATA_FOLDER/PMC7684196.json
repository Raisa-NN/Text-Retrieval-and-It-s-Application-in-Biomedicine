His past medical history included anxiety and hypertension. He lived alone, smoked 15 roll-up cigarettes daily and consumed a moderate volume of alcohol per week. He had a World Health Organization performance status score of 1 and a Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool score of 0. Direct examination and subsequent computed tomography of the head and neck confirmed a T3 transglottic lesion with no evidence of distant disease; biopsy of this lesion confirmed a moderately differentiated SCC. His case was discussed at the regional head and neck multidisciplinary team meeting, and a total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection was proposed, to which he subsequently agreed.\\nHis operation was planned for the end of March 2020 for social reasons; however, two weeks prior to his operation date the Covid-19 pandemic was declared. The patient underwent standard pre-operative investigations including blood work, electrocardiography and an echocardiogram, the findings for all of which were normal. British Association of Head and Neck Oncology guidance for laryngectomy during Covid-19 was followed; the patient was advised to self-isolate for 14 days and asked to attend his local ENT department for two Covid-19 swab tests within the week prior to surgery. His first swab was negative; however, the second swab, performed 4 days later, was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His surgery was postponed and he was asked to self-isolate for a further 14 days. He was asymptomatic at the time of testing and remained so throughout his isolation period.\\nDuring the 14-day self-isolation period, he underwent Covid-19 swab testing on days 7 and 14. Both swabs were negative and therefore his operation was rescheduled to take place 2 days following his most recent negative swab test. The day before surgery, he was admitted to a \u2018clean\u2019 tertiary centre with no accident and emergency or dedicated Covid-19 ward. He was again swab tested on admission and found to be negative.\\nThe patient successfully underwent total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection following clearance of Covid-19, only two weeks later than initially planned. Despite his negative swab results, enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn throughout the surgical procedure by operating theatre staff, including a filtering facepiece code 3 (FFP3) mask, face shield, disposable cap, fluid-resistant gown and gloves. There were no surgical or anaesthetic-related peri-operative complications.\\nThe patient progressed well on the ward following surgery. Healthcare professionals wore enhanced PPE, including FFP3 masks, face shield, fluid-resistant gowns and gloves when carrying out AGPs (e.g. suctioning and stoma care). On morning ward rounds, he was reviewed by a senior member of the medical team who wore a fluid-resistant surgical mask, face shield, apron and gloves. There were no post-operative complications and the patient was safely discharged two weeks after his surgery.\\nThe patient was reviewed in clinic one month post-operatively; his wounds were healing well and he was eating and drinking without issue. His final pathology report revealed a completely excised, moderately to poorly differentiated laryngeal SCC, pathologically confirmed as tumour\u2013node stage T3N0 (based on the 8th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control tumour\u2013node\u2013metastasis (TNM) classification). Following discussion with the oncology department, the patient decided against adjuvant radiotherapy. The British Association of Head and Neck Oncology advises against same-day tracheoesophageal puncture and speech valve insertion during the pandemic, to reduce the length of hospital stay and associated complications; he therefore remains on the waiting list for this.", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29756382': 1, '32066541': 1, '32196070': 1, '34853865': 1, '32298035': 1, '33143754': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
