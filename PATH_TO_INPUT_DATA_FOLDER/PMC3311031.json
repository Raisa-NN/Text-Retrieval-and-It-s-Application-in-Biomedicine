The patient underwent postoperative chemotherapy after surgery and had follow up visits every six months. Blood pressure and heart rate were 150/85 mmHg and 136 beats/minute, respectively. Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur. End-inspiratory crackles suggested pulmonary edema. Echocardiography revealed a left atrial mass protruding through the mitral valve (Figures and ). Continous wave spectral Doppler showed mitral stenosis with a mitral valve area less than 1.0 cm2 (Figures and ). Additionally, a giant mass in the left pleural space penetrating the left pulmonary veins could be demonstrated by ultrasound (Figures and ) and by computed tomography (Figures and ). Biopsy of the pleural tumor revealed metastasis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (Figure ). Pulmonary edema resolved with symptomatic treatment. Before discussing further treatment options, the patient died suddenly four days after admission.", "age": "[[59.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10893397': 1, '16683388': 1, '14998838': 1, '5904228': 1, '562174': 1, '26518517': 2, '22401306': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4628272-1': 1}"}
