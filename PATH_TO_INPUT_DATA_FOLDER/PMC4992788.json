This was caused by a massive calcified atheroma above the iliac bifurcation, documented by a preoperative CT scan. The CT scan also showed an 18 mm renal cyst at the third medium of the right kidney. The patient underwent endovascular infrarenal aortic stenting (CP Stent\u2122, NuMed Inc.) and 9 mm iliac bilateral kissing stenting (E\u00b7LUMINEXX\u00ae, Bard Peripheral Vascular) with good results and his symptoms disappeared. During the endovascular procedure, it is common to give a bolus of HMWH and the patient was given a bolus of 2000 UI, according to his weight. Twelve hours after the procedure, the patient complained of abdominal pain on his right side, mostly at the hypochondrium; this subsided after taking pain medication (ketorolac trometamina iv).\\nWe suspected a biliary colic because of the presence of a 14 mm gallstone and a positive Murphy's sign. Thus, the patient underwent an abdominal US that found \u201cno dilatations of the bile ducts and the presence, in the right kidney, of a solid formation, probably due to hematoma\u201d (Figures and ).\\nA CT scan confirmed the suspicion (Figures and ). An extended perirenal subcapsular hematoma was detected in the right kidney with a maximum axial thickness of approximately 46 mm, with contrast enhancement in the late stages of the study. It was associated with a full-thickness rupture in the renal parenchyma, with a maximum size of more than 4 cm, that largely covered the middle third and lower pole of the right kidney. The first instance can be attributed to a plurifocal renal breakage. The laboratory examinations revealed that haemoglobin levels, renal function, coagulation profile, and urine test were in the normal ranges.\\nAt this point we opted for a conservative approach. We followed the patient up with blood tests and an ultrasound each day and symptoms diminished within two days. The patient was discharged after seven days. We performed a CT after 3 months that showed a complete resolution of the subcapsular hematoma and reduced renal laceration, with remaining hypodense foci that indicated interruption from cortical to the medullary part of the kidney: this scenario was compatible with a significant regression of the SPH (Figures and ).", "age": "[[66.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'33062596': 1, '16444440': 1, '19537068': 1, '31131136': 2, '16985559': 1, '2300864': 1, '7248695': 1, '32401061': 2, '9471886': 1, '2772165': 1, '5120886': 1, '8740036': 1, '20981200': 2, '3339720': 1, '21765296': 1, '11912370': 1, '27579210': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2955227-1': 1, '6519508-1': 1, '7223858-1': 1}"}
