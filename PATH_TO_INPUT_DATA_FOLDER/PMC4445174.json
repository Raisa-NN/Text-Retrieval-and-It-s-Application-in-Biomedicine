The patient's medical history included a hysterectomy and a left side ovariectomy at the age of 27. The CT scan revealed a 45 mm tumor in the patient's pelvis [Figure and ], which was diagnosed as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), a chronic expanding hematoma or leiomyoma. A forward-view EUS (TGF-UC260J, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) identified a low echoic lesion when scanned from the sigmoid colon. FNA was performed with a 22-gauge needle (EZShot2, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) by using the forward-view EUS []. Examination of the FNA specimen revealed a foreign body (string of gauze) displaying macrophage cells and necrotic tissue [; hematoxylin and eosin, original magnification \u00d740]. During the surgery, the foreign body composed of gauze was located and removed. The site was deemed clean as no remaining foreign bodies were detected. The site was free of infection and without abscess. Histological examination of the tissue adjacent to the foreign body revealed granuloma formations with fragmented silken threads [; hematoxylin and eosin, original magnification, \u00d7100 and \u00d7200].", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'3282401': 1, '20561620': 1, '704844': 1, '15692931': 1, '8933791': 1, '11774943': 1, '16996367': 1, '26020051': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
