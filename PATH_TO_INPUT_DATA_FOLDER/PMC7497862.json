The left tonsil was diagnosed as pT2N2bcM0, the right as pT2N0M0, both Grade 2. Combined radio-chemotherapy was recommended, but only radiotherapy was performed (59.5/50.4Gy) because the patient refused chemotherapy. The patient was free of disease at her last visit to the clinic two years post-diagnosis, after which she was lost to follow up but was reported to have died approximately one year later due to pneumonia.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'31003993': 1, '27343048': 1, '25313082': 1, '30467851': 1, '22267298': 1, '30391517': 1, '28670333': 2, '24737733': 1, '19945619': 1, '21123375': 1, '11279600': 1, '30449623': 1, '24201445': 1, '29263809': 1, '29497144': 1, '26424075': 1, '25581428': 1, '33073473': 1, '30207593': 1, '30367463': 1, '26963717': 1, '30590684': 1, '21225779': 1, '28928286': 1, '25575501': 1, '34439243': 1, '30835832': 1, '23062994': 1, '28112728': 1, '31014281': 2, '28891195': 1, '29443391': 1, '29059337': 1, '30449625': 1, '23715200': 1, '31603606': 1, '29555599': 1, '24177760': 1, '18235120': 1, '27140027': 1, '23891017': 1, '21969503': 1, '27422711': 1, '30018982': 1, '29158935': 2, '32954225': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5660802-1': 1, '6480742-1': 1, '6480742-2': 1, '6480742-3': 1, '5485684-1': 1}"}
