His initial diagnosis was acute cerebral infarction (). He had been pointed out to have a partially thrombosed giant fusiform basilar artery aneurysm 3 months ago and we decided to follow up with imaging studies because the patient was asymptomatic and refused the treatment (). He suddenly fell into a coma on the third day of hospitalization. His plain computerized tomography (CT) of the head showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which was relatively thick in the right anterior pontine cistern (). He underwent emergency ventricular drainage, and his level of consciousness improved to a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of nine points. Subsequent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a newly formed bleb on the right shoulder of the previously noted fusiform basilar artery aneurysm (). From the distribution of SAH on CT and the findings of DSA, we assumed that the newly generated bleb was the rupture point this time. His preoperative modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was 5.", "age": "[[62.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25118057': 1, '7062068': 1, '28565985': 1, '33216209': 1, '31838533': 1, '32719653': 1, '20667221': 1, '32745190': 1, '32112933': 1, '31935782': 1, '20616327': 1, '24818049': 2, '33569162': 2, '24081786': 1, '21734614': 1, '9146686': 1, '26598391': 1, '32486121': 1, '6738853': 1, '20566117': 1, '24535790': 1, '20950090': 1, '26801480': 1, '34659100': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4014823-1': 1, '7852473-1': 1}"}
