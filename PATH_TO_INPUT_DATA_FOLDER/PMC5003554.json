The visual acuity was decreased to 20/40. The smallest MH diameter was 638 \u03bcm. Study of FAF images obtained with Optos showed an increased autofluorescence signal corresponding to the MH (). This patient underwent surgery with pars plana vitrectomy and posterior hyaloid dissection and ILM peeling assisted with brilliant blue G staining, and a final air\u2013gas exchange with 20% SF6 gas. On postoperative day 1, OCT showed bridge formation (foveal detachment) (). Study of FAF images obtained with Optos showed reduced but persistent autofluorescence in the macula in the SF6 gas-filled eye (). After reabsorption of the gas, the OCT examination confirmed foveal detachment (). FAF imaging by Optos showed a ring of hypoautofluorescence surrounding the central area of relative hyperautofluorescence (). The quantitative analysis confirmed high FAF intensity (91.5%) before the operation and decreased FAF intensity (55.3% and 43.4%) 1 and 7 days after the surgery, respectively (, ). This case indicates that bridge formation (foveal detachment) could decrease FAF intensity.", "age": "[[64.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'33040254': 1, '15948778': 1, '18779715': 1, '22722489': 1, '22080911': 1, '10922208': 1, '23411888': 1, '30046539': 1, '23343822': 1, '19089443': 1, '3947616': 1, '21909053': 1, '15126174': 1, '23860759': 1, '23095234': 1, '2025167': 1, '19061988': 1, '23890419': 1, '27601877': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5003554-1': 2}"}
