Laboratory data were as follows: AST 35 IU/l (normal 5\u201335), ALT 21 IU/l (normal 5\u201330), ALP 198 U/l (normal 115\u2013359), \u03b3-GTP 67 IU/l (normal 0\u201350), LDH 162 IU/l (normal 106\u2013211), Alb 2.9 g/dl (normal 3.7\u20135.5), TB 0.7 mg/dl (normal 0.2\u20131.0), and PT-INR 1.18. Child-Turcotte-Pugh grade was A. The ICG-R15 was 19%. The concentration of serum AFP was 1,210 ng/ml (normal <20) and plasma DCP was 209 mAU/ml (normal <40). No serological evidence of hepatitis B or C was seen. CECT revealed a tumor measuring 20 mm in diameter in segment 2 of the liver, accompanied by tumor thrombi toward the main left portal vein (fig. ). We diagnosed HCC with tumor thrombi. The patient requested radical surgery, so left hemi-hepatectomy was performed (fig. ). The operation time was 304 min, and the amount of blood loss was 379 ml. Pathological findings revealed poorly differentiated HCC (fig. ).", "age": "[[91.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23490541': 1, '2410090': 1, '9164528': 1, '20015526': 1, '24419713': 1, '26811608': 1, '12742961': 1, '16088422': 1, '2643548': 1, '18642042': 1, '19123236': 1, '8087778': 1, '34157207': 1, '22968066': 1, '22295877': 1, '28272222': 1, '30606220': 1, '14609867': 1, '10370589': 1, '19359195': 1, '8048856': 1, '7122354': 1, '21282258': 1, '8110505': 1, '22115802': 1, '25802498': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4357676-1': 2}"}
