The past medical history includes an unexplained coma for three days at the age of three years, followed by childhood epilepsy. Seizures were controlled by phenobarbital given until the age of 14 years. She also suffered from substituted hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension (regulated by appropriate therapy). She does not have any learning difficulties or developmental delay. She was born from non-consanguineous parents. The family history reveals that her older sister had epilepsy and severe mental retardation. The clinical examination confirmed a right laterocollis associated with a no-no head tremor. No cerebellar syndrome has been noticed. In addition, routine biological tests have shown a moderate hyperammonaemia of 69 \u00b5mol/L (normal range: 11\u201335 \u00b5mol/L), absence of acid-base disorders and a normal glycemia of 5.1 mmol/L (reference range: 4\u20136 mmol/L). Of note, the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid showed a moderate hyperproteinorachia (0.62 g/L; N < 0.4).", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19242819': 1, '28583327': 1, '17459752': 1, '25725137': 1, '29565174': 1, '17885065': 1, '32070364': 1, '3063529': 1, '719902': 1, '17941049': 1, '19932602': 1, '1430427': 1, '26041581': 1, '15505778': 1, '31047871': 1, '25557019': 1, '34573903': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
