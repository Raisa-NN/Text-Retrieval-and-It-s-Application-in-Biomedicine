Twenty-five days earlier, he had a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR performed after unprotected contact with his son, who was tested positive. He was not hospitalized and was discharged home. Two weeks later, his RT-PCR was negative. He had never developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection. As part of the paraparesis etiological assessment, a cerebral CT scan was performed, and the results were normal. Also, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed, which showed an insidious bilateral PE (Figure ) with suggestive signs of COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure ). The patient was hemodynamically stable, and oxygen saturation was 95% at room air. EKG and TTE were normal. The patient underwent a therapeutic dose of anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin, switched to rivaroxaban, and was followed up by his cardiologist.", "age": "[[85.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'32788102': 1, '34754657': 2, '31986264': 1, '32834989': 1, '32491919': 1, '32780839': 1, '32903492': 1, '32868974': 2, '32435823': 1, '33407578': 2, '32748336': 1, '32928824': 1, '33854858': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8038649-1': 2, '8038649-2': 2, '7453687-1': 1, '8569651-1': 1, '7785914-1': 1}"}
