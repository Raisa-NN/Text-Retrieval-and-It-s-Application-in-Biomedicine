These revealed features of thin walled midline cystic structure. A transurethral biopsy was done and the histology confirmed a benign urachal cyst. The patient was reassured and discharged from follow up.\\nHe represented four years later and a repeat CTU showed the lesion now contained thick calcified walls. He was referred to a tertiary center where a robotic assisted excision of the lesion and a partial cystectomy was performed. The histopathological analysis revealed a well-differentiated (G1 pT3a) adenocarcinoma, intestinal type, with evidence of positive margins. He was started on a regime of Folinic acid, 5-Flourouracil, Oxaloplatin (FOLFOX) regime of adjuvant chemotherapy. He tolerated his first two cycles of chemotherapy well and is currently under surveillance.", "age": "[[49.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26583595': 1, '7057501': 1, '31384429': 1, '27894318': 2, '23040259': 1, '16826585': 1, '23089466': 1, '19252435': 1, '12720197': 1, '31113786': 1, '27267737': 1, '22901574': 1, '33858907': 2, '30271532': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8054045-1': 1, '5126806-1': 1}"}
