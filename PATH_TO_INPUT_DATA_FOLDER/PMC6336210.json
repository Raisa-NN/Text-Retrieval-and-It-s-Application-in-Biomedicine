The lesion was subcutaneous and skin was intact without any colour change. The patient underwent a mammogram (Figure ) and an ultrasound (Figure ), which revealed an irregular soft tissue mass at the 12-o\u2019clock position, measuring 2.4 x 1.4 cm (T2). There was no calcification but an increased vascularity was noted. No lymph node was palpable or detected by imaging. Subsequently, the patient underwent a core biopsy that revealed sheets of poorly differentiated malignant small blue cells at a high mitotic rate, focally demonstrating rhabdoid-type features. AE1/AE3, neuron-specific enolase, and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) showed typical strong cytoplasmic dot positivity (Figure ). Neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin and neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56)) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) were also positive, as was cytoplasmic positivity for beta-catenin (Figure ). S100, cytokeratin 5 (CK5), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), napsin A, GATA3, estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)/neu protein were all negative. The immunohistochemical profile and pattern of cytokeratin staining were most in keeping with MCC. Retrospective pathological workup showed the MCC tumor was negative for polyomavirus, and a small amount of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was noted with a cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) immunoassay. An 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18FDG PET/CT) performed two weeks after biopsy did not show any FDG-avid lesion, except for a nonspecific uptake in multiple mediastinal lymph nodes. The tumor was staged as IIA (T2N0). His scheduled lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were canceled since the PET imaging was negative and there was no mass felt on clinical evaluation. A follow-up CT at three months was also normal without any abnormality at the site of the lump. 18FDG PET/CT repeated at nine months showed hypermetabolic activity in multiple lymph node regions and in the spleen. The findings were considered as reactive as opposed to metastatic disease since biopsy of the supraclavicular node demonstrated reactive changes only. The patient is on continued follow-up up to three years to rule out local recurrence or metastatic disease in the future.", "age": "[[77.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17760677': 1, '20418670': 1, '11952300': 1, '5009611': 1, '26788270': 2, '19597021': 1, '27596690': 1, '27759689': 1, '20371072': 1, '20384741': 1, '10848744': 1, '34629908': 1, '30675444': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4703916-1': 1}"}
