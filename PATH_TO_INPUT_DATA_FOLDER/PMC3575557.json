He had no medical history, he denied even slight trauma of the neck, and his only cardiovascular risk factor was tobacco smoking for 10 years. Neurological examination revealed verbal aphasia and left hemiparesis.\\nDuring CT angiography (TK\u201364-row MDCT scanner, LightSpeed VCT, GE, Waukesha, WI) of the neck and head, segmental dissections of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) at the level of the cranial basis were discovered (Fig. a). The lumen of the ICA was decreased to 4 \u00d7 2.5 mm (60 % of normal flow). Cerebral CT showed a recent infarction involving the medial part of the right temporal lobe and deep structures of the right hemisphere including the thalamus, the genu and the posterior limb of the internal capsule (Fig. b).\\nCT angiography of the neck and head also showed a duplication of the left vertebral artery (LVA) with two origins, both from the left subclavian artery (Figs. , ). The duplicated segments were fused at level of the C5\u20136 vertebrae into a single vertebral artery, which then entered the transverse foramen of C5 (Fig. ). All measurements were taken on an Advantage Workstation (GE).\\nThe first LVA originated from the left subclavian artery at a distance of 7 mm from the aortic arch. It measured 2.9 and 2.8 mm in diameter at the points of origin and just before fusion, respectively (Fig. ). The course of the artery was 101 mm. The second LVA arose from the left subclavian artery 37 mm distal to the first (44 mm from the aortic arch). It measured 2.4 and 2.2 mm in diameter at the points of origin and just before fusion, respectively (Fig. ), and its course was 89 mm. Both vertebral arteries possessed a regular lumen. The diameter of the LVA after fusion was 3.3 mm (at level C5\u20136) (Fig. ).\\nThe right VA arose as the first branch from the left subclavian artery, 43 mm from the aortic arch. Its course was normal. The diameters of the right VA were 4 mm at the points of origin and 3.8 mm at the C5\u2013C6 vertebrae (Fig. ). Both thyrocervical trunks were seen to originate separately from the subclavian arteries.\\nAdditionally, complementary but independent to CT angiography Doppler Sonography B-flow mode (Vivid 7 Pro, GE) of the vertebral arteries also revealed a duplicated LVA (Fig. ).\\nAfter all procedures were completed, Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome type IV was diagnosed.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9144714': 1, '27478740': 2, '15118399': 1, '24851007': 2, '27074275': 1, '10772143': 1, '19127056': 1, '9111680': 1, '22093143': 1, '11246397': 1, '18302642': 1, '3600990': 1, '19890113': 1, '4878678': 1, '643170': 1, '29354233': 2, '4407645': 1, '2769307': 1, '11445623': 1, '3614630': 1, '33304686': 2, '16960096': 1, '16775285': 1, '12772251': 1, '1528435': 1, '27749814': 1, '11465760': 1, '17290108': 1, '8614918': 1, '11259724': 1, '9641395': 1, '22956231': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7719502-1': 1, '4951390-1': 1, '5769842-1': 1, '5769842-2': 1, '5769842-3': 1, '4028918-1': 1}"}
