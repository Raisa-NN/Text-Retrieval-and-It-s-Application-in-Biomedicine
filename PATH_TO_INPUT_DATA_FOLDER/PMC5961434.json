No hematochezia or melaena stated. Fecal occult is strongly positive in the ED. No endoscopies were found in her records. PMHx included COPD, osteoarthritis and DVT. Significant physical exam findings included mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness and RUQ palpable mass, and normal bowel sounds. Labs were significant for a hemoglobin of 5.7, hematocrit of 18.6% and CEA of 29.6. An abdominal/pelvis CT exhibited a 6 cm circumferential mass of the hepatic flexure (Figs \u2013). Two days later, a right hemicolectomy with en bloc pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Pathology showed adenocarcinoma stage IIIc (Figs \u2013). Post-operatively, an abdominal/pelvis CT showed bilateral pulmonary emboli and a 14 cm pelvic abscess. Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound showed low probability for DVT. Exploratory laparotomy was performed where the pelvic abscess was seen and extensive lysis of adhesions, resection of ileocolonic anastomosis for contained leak and ileostomy performed. Approximately 4 months after discharge, the patient passed away while in a long-term care facility.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'2218891': 1, '19617748': 1, '11870671': 1, '18231797': 1, '23739194': 1, '33639983': 1, '12692203': 1, '11807361': 1, '24726745': 1, '18162131': 1, '29876046': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
