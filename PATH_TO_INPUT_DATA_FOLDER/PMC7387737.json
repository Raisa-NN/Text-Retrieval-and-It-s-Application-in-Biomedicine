For that reason a surgical radical debridement was performed with complete exposure of muscle and tendons and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) positioning.\\nThe first dressing change was done after 48 h in order to check the viability of the wound bed, which appeared to be well vascularized and without signs of infection.\\nAfter 3 days, Integra\u24c7 double layer was applied on the tissue defect and sutured with metal clips, we also made several stab incisions on the dermal substitute in order to facilitate residual fluid drainage. The wound coverage was performed with V.A.C. Therapy\u24c7 set to \u221275 mmHg in continuous mode. Dressing changes were carried out every 4 days and, after 3 weeks, the external silicon layer was removed. The integration of the dermal substitute was checked and we covered the wound with split-thickness skin grafts. Instead of the traditional bandage, we applied V.A.C. Therapy\u24c7 on the grafted area using the same above-mentioned negative pressure regimen.\\nSkin-graft take was between 90% and 95% with complete healing of the wound within 15 days.\\nSix weeks after the first surgical debridement, the patient could resume chemotherapy administration , , , and .", "age": "[[68.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22997449': 1, '21255716': 1, '21200292': 1, '15060345': 1, '22821839': 1, '32322648': 1, '21200280': 1, '28330679': 1, '20864422': 1, '25593427': 1, '24335895': 1, '32743039': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
