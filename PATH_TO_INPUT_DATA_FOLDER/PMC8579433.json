The axial CTA images taken at levels of ischial tuberosity (Figure ) and upper thigh (Figure ) showed these arteries (Figure ) as a continuation of the internal iliac arteries, exiting bilaterally into the posterior thigh through the infra-pyriformis compartment of the greater sciatic foramen. The arteries exit about 1cm from the greater sciatic foramen bilaterally. They were about 5mm in caliber and continued as the popliteal arteries close to the sciatic nerve (Figure ). Volume-rendered CT imaging showed posterior and oblique projections (Figures , ) confirming the continuation of internal iliac arteries as PSAs, exiting through greater sciatic foramen bilaterally (Figure ). The CT also showed the relatively smaller-sized bilateral superficial femoral arteries ([SFAs] Figure ).", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19231248': 1, '23749710': 1, '16897269': 1, '32862980': 1, '23261272': 1, '3512010': 1, '27369291': 1, '34786246': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
