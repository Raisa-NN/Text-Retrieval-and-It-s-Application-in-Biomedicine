He had normal prostate on digital rectal examination and ultrasound. Ultrasound KUB showed a mass measuring 5 cm \u00d7 4 cm behind the bladder. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abdomen revealed a mass of 5 cm \u00d7 4 cm in the rectovesical pouch []. The mass was well circumscribed and nonenhancing. It showed low intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted (T1W and T2W) images. MRI signal was similar to that of the muscle with central high-intensity area on T1W images. Laparoscopy revealed a free-floating egg-shaped, glisxtening white mass in the rectovesical pouch []. The mass was not attached to any pelvic structure and it was removed in an endocatch bag. On sectioning, it had a classic \u2018boiled-egg\u2019 appearance. The white part was smooth and soft in consistency, while the central yellow part was slightly firm. The surfaces were smooth. Histopathology revealed laminated strands of a fibrinoid substance with a large amount of proteinaceous material in the peripheral white part and saponified fat with calcification in the central yellow part. His urinary symptoms and pain subsided after removal of the mass.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9014730': 1, '17939421': 1, '19394607': 1, '14513332': 1, '30337787': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
