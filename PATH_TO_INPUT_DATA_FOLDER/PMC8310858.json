From the age of 29 years, he developed headaches, nausea, memory impairment, poor coordination, as well as olfactory and auditory hallucinations. MRI brain scans, including venography, were normal and there was no enhancement with gadolinium. CSF analysis revealed a mild lymphocytosis with raised CSF protein (Table ). Unmatched oligoclonal bands were detected on one occasion but were not persistent. Electroencephalography confirmed complex partial seizures arising from the right hemisphere and occurring on a background of mild excess of nonspecific slow and theta activity. Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies were negative, but anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies were detected. Subacute memory impairment, altered personality, and psychiatric symptoms together with the emergence of seizures, CSF pleocytosis, and autoantibodies (anti-GAD) were in keeping with autoimmune encephalitis []. He was treated with corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and anticonvulsant therapy with introduction of azathioprine and then mycophenolate as a steroid-sparing agent. Following the diagnosis of CTLA4 haploinsufficiency (age 32 years), he was switched to sirolimus with some improvement to his symptoms; headaches and hallucinations resolved, seizure control improved, and there has been no further decline in cognitive function.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'29729943': 1, '34097529': 2, '25213377': 1, '31228212': 1, '30196822': 1, '26906964': 1, '31219194': 1, '25329329': 1, '29796761': 1, '33956248': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8358566-1': 1}"}
