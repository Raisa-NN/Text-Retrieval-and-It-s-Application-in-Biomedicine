He developed vomiting prior to presenting. He had participated in the same military training at the same time as the previous two patients. He was febrile at 40.8\u00b0C and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Chest radiograph revealed bilateral interstitial opacities with effusions. He received broad spectrum antibiotics for presumed complicated pneumonia. Laboratory investigations are shown in . The patient required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for hypoxia.\\nCultures from BAL revealed normal flora and were negative for Pneumocystis, Legionella, mycobacteria, or fungi. Blood cultures and Histoplasma urinary antigen were negative. This patient did not require intubation and rapidly improved over several days.\\nHantavirus serology was IgG positive at 1/400, but IgM equivocal. Repeat serology revealed a rise in IgG titre to 1/1600. Hantavirus PCR performed on the BAL specimen was negative.", "age": "[[30.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16027428': 1, '19434035': 1, '25015860': 1, '29769944': 1, '25653648': 1, '25566236': 1, '22068147': 1, '32850756': 1, '8612216': 1, '12402401': 1, '24274585': 1, '23607444': 1, '24478763': 1, '33219792': 1, '28096821': 1, '25859243': 1, '20375360': 1, '8569401': 1, '11049774': 1, '1973603': 1, '33679248': 1, '27366160': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4904570-1': 2, '4904570-2': 2}"}
