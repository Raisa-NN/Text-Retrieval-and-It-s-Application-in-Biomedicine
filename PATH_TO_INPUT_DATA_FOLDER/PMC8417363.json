The patient had no history of previous diseases, with normal renal and liver function and serum albumin at the start of treatment. During the first course of HDMTX (5 g/m2 e.v., in 24 h) with adequate previous hydration and urine alkalinization an elevated MTX level was detected 24 h after starting infusion (190 \u03bcmol/L, toxic > 150 \u03bcmol/L). Despite adequate treatment with hydration (3,000 ml/m2/24 h) and leucovorin rescue (30 mg/m2/6 h), the patient presented persistently elevated MTX levels after 36 and 48 h (620 and 510 \u03bcmol/L). In addition, non-oliguric renal failure with creatinine increase to 2.36 mg/dL (eGFR 34.5 ml/min/1.73 m2) was observed. The patient received the first dose of glucarpidase (50 U/kg) 48 h and second dose 96 h after starting MTX infusion, nevertheless an insufficient decrease in MTX levels was observed (). MTX levels continued persistently high (MTX at 100 h 3.8 \u03bcmol/L, toxic >0.4) despite two doses of glucarpidase, hydration, urine alkalinization and leucovorin rescue. Glucarpidase was no further available. The patient presented in reduced general status, in the absence of diarrhea, mucositis, or other symptoms such as hypertension. Persistent renal failure (with maintained diuresis) and increasing creatinine (max. creatinine 3.45 mg/dL at day 9 after MTX) was observed at admission. Leukopenia (1.4 \u00d7 109/l) was observed too. Rescue treatment with hemoperfusion was indicated. CHP was performed without complications on days 9, 10, 11, and 12 after MTX infusion with no complications other than slight anemia (hemoglobin 8 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia (100 \u00d7 109/l). Progressive improvement was achieved under treatment with CHP, with reduction in MTX levels, recovery of renal function and normalization of blood count ().", "age": "[[11.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19863208': 1, '3812535': 1, '329989': 1, '25984119': 2, '27335061': 1, '2285498': 1, '20444738': 1, '29079637': 1, '3261621': 1, '24004183': 1, '8957036': 1, '2873302': 1, '15139068': 1, '19131789': 1, '28339843': 1, '27496039': 1, '12376811': 1, '29318217': 1, '22252903': 1, '1896111': 1, '28983943': 1, '15668713': 1, '32558929': 1, '26488798': 1, '16794248': 1, '27966809': 1, '889610': 1, '627142': 1, '28983060': 1, '27569442': 1, '34490152': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8417363-1': 2, '8417363-2': 2, '4421587-1': 1}"}
