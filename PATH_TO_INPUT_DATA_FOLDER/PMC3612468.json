The latter is nothing but a simple graphical representation of the pain, recorded on a 10 cm numerical scale ranging from zero (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain ever felt). This method allows the patient to bypass the cognitive level of his brain and give a truer representation of pain.\\nFor assessing the quality of life questionnaire, (Psychological General Well Being Index) PGWBI was administered [].\\nThe patient was informed on the technique, the benefits, and the potential complications of the intervention as well as postprocedure care, and a written informed consent was obtained.\\nThe hematological examinations including blood coagulation were obtained, and all the values were within the normal range.\\nThe segment to be treated was identified under fluoroscopic guidance (Allura, Phillips, The Netherlands) on the angiography table with the patient in prone position.\\nLocal anesthesia consisting of lidocaine 2% (10 mL) and naropine 7.5% (10 mL) and drugs for sedation in spontaneous breathing were administered, and a 13 G needle with left transpedicular approach at the level of D12, L1, and L4 bodies was introduced.\\nAbout 3 mL of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) were injected in every vertebral body with uniform distribution of cementing material without intra- and postprocedural complications ().\\nAfter a few hours from the end of the procedure, pain relief was significant.\\nDuration of the procedure was about 25 minutes.\\nThe efficacy of a PVP was demonstrated by a decrease from 9/10 to 4/10 on static VAS score.\\nFor the evaluation of psychophysical well-being, PGWBI [] questionnaire was used, including 22 items, each of which presents a series of six possible answers, whose score is proportional to the positivity and well-being over the last four weeks.\\nThe scale consists of six domains or dimensions: anxiety, depression, positivity and well-being, self-control, general health, and vitality.\\nDuring hospitalization, the patient obtained a score of 54, equal to serious illness. At one month after PVP, the patient has scored 65, equivalent to moderate discomfort.\\nAfter the procedure, the patient did not need any antalgic therapy, and there was a significant improvement on passive mobilization, performance of physiological functions, daily management of personal care, and maintaining skin integrity for the treatment of decubitus ulcers, with a significant increase of life quality and psychological well-being.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19769906': 1, '21107952': 1, '22523717': 1, '19657122': 1, '18459032': 1, '15714305': 1, '14514838': 1, '19778703': 1, '7473027': 1, '26316783': 1, '23573449': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
