The history of the individual and the cause of death were not known. The infratemporal fossa was exposed by resection of ramus of mandible, zygomatic arch, and lateral pterygoid muscle. The topographic details of the fossa were examined by causal dissection and photographed. We came across the following variations.\\nLN was formed by two roots: anterior and posterior. Posterior root (PR) originated from the MN directly, while the anterior root (AR) was a branch of common trunk (CT). CT originated from MN directed downward anterior to second part of MA and was about 2 cm in length. CT was divided into two branches, AR of LN which was about 4 mm in length directed downwards and medially, and other branch continued downwards as IAN [].\\nMA instead of being lateral (superior) to lateral pterygoid muscle was found medial (deep) to the muscle. Second part of MA passed through the nerve loop which was superiorly formed by MN, anteriorly by CT, posteriorly by PR and inferiorly by AR [].", "age": "[[65.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17764991': 1, '18330427': 1, '27269666': 1, '12804545': 1, '19221662': 1, '19205566': 1, '23776794': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
