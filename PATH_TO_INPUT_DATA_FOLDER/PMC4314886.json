The epidermal nevus was not of the common hyperkeratotic pigmented type, but resembled a linear organoid nevus by its softer texture and light color. However, the patient refused additional biopsy and further workup to determine histologic subtype of the nevus. The lesion had been present since birth and was asymptomatic until approximately 1 year ago, when a slowly enlarging ulcer appeared on the upper arm. The ulcer was biopsied and histological investigation revealed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with deep invasion into the dermis []. The patient was offered appropriate therapy by an oncologist, but he sought the second opinion and was referred to the Dermatology Department. On clinical examination, it was noted that besides the large crusted ulcer of confirmed BCC on the arm [], there were several other loci of evolving tumors on the patient's back [Figures and ]. Dermoscopy revealed diagnostic features of a BCC. The patient declared no other problems with his health and was advised to follow treatment recommendation of the consultant oncologist.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19122450': 1, '15807685': 1, '17456927': 1, '7212744': 1, '29230330': 2, '3962409': 1, '24403890': 2, '29159004': 2, '23154248': 1, '25657916': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5690489-1': 1, '5690489-2': 1, '5688257-1': 1, '3884180-1': 1}"}
