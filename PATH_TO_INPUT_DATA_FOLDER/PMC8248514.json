He denied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use or tobacco use. Surgical history included prostatectomy without radiation therapy. Physical examination was unremarkable other than generalized abdominal pain. Laboratory studies were within normal limits as well, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen showed a large pelvic mass with circumferential involvement of the rectum with evidence of contained perforation (Figure ). Subsequently, a flexible sigmoidoscopy confirmed a large ulcerated mass eroding into the retroperitoneum and perirectal space shown by red arrows (Figure ). Biopsies showed diffuse infiltrate of plasma cells with marked nuclear atypia within the lamina propria and submucosa that was consistent with plasma cell neoplasm (Figure ).\\nThe patient was referred to a multidisciplinary oncology team for further evaluation and management. Extramedullary multiple myeloma involving the colon is a rare presentation with rectal involvement as an eroding mass along with fistulous tracts not reported before. Although gastrointestinal plasma cell neoplasms are rare, they must be considered in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. The suspicion should increase in patients with a previous diagnosis of multiple myeloma.", "age": "[[84.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'28503336': 2, '20703830': 1, '34250177': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5414488-1': 1}"}
