She was referred to the A.C.Camargo Cancer Center for follow up care. Before chemoradiation therapy started, recurrence was detected and the patient underwent a second surgery. After the second surgery, histopathological analysis confirmed the evolution to a secondary GBM. The patient received chemotherapy (Temozolomide) and radiotherapy after the second surgery and had a survival of 16 months after the diagnosis. We received eight histologically distinct fragments from the second surgery, which were classified as high- or low-grade, by an experienced pathologist according to the 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System []. The tumor was obtained with patient informed consent. Protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee in 11/12/2012 (CEP #1692/12).", "age": "[[47.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'30031763': 1, '23412337': 1, '25605792': 1, '28031556': 1, '21422072': 1, '24045637': 1, '33408739': 1, '24336570': 1, '11328886': 1, '27157931': 1, '18480124': 1, '33203845': 1, '26824661': 1, '22367541': 1, '28863449': 1, '20129251': 1, '22323597': 1, '24925914': 1, '25743081': 1, '29486283': 1, '28277937': 1, '25352553': 1, '25234618': 1, '22836135': 1, '19269895': 1, '27723727': 1, '25122893': 1, '27602954': 1, '16632515': 1, '21593866': 1, '25580734': 1, '26967052': 1, '29328863': 1, '23056544': 1, '27521447': 1, '19114008': 1, '23340270': 1, '24893890': 1, '29991528': 1, '24120142': 1, '18985363': 1, '27307601': 1, '21789182': 1, '27789731': 1, '31052505': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
