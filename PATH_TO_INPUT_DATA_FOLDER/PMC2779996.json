The patient was thin with small breasts, cap A. The patient suffered from invasive ductal carcinoma with negative sentinel node, which was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. She was found to be a carrier of the BRCA1 gene. The patient underwent immediate breast reconstruction following bilateral mastectomy. Because of the fact that her breasts were small and the patient desire of larger breasts, tissue expanders were inserted. During the operation, an AlloDerm sheet of 16 \u00d7 4 cm2 to the lower pole of the pocket was used. After the first operation, the tissue expanders (450 cc) were inflated to a total volume of 500 cc with development of synmastia during the inflation. Six months later the patient underwent exchange of the expanders with silicone implants (440 cc) and correction of synmastia with an AlloDerm sling as mentioned above. During her postoperative period the patient was dressed for 2 weeks with a pressure dressing directly over the sternal area to prevent development of a seroma or edema.
