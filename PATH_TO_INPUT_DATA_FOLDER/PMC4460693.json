Test results were positive and she underwent a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy revealed a tumour in her caecum. Abdominal and thoracic computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed no metastasis. She then underwent elective surgery. During the operation, a 6\u00d75cm tumour was found in her caecum. Her MD was found 40cm from the hepatoduodenal ligament []. A right hemicolectomy was performed to excise the MD from her jejunal loop. After the operation, she underwent chemotherapy. There were no complications related to the surgery. Histological results showed a poorly differentiated G3 adenocarcinoma of the caecum. In her small intestine a muscular layer of excised MD and mesenteric adipose tissue was found, which was pancreatic tissue morphologically. Microscopic analysis revealed pancreatic tissue without islets of Langerhans (Figure ) in the small intestine and mesenteric adipose tissue. Moreover, in the HP tissue, dilatation of the pancreatic ducts was observed.", "age": "[[81.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21362295': 1, '17258745': 1, '19589283': 1, '14966359': 2, '19561251': 1, '19361655': 1, '28660326': 1, '20977114': 1, '11856140': 1, '27603341': 2, '19274480': 1, '24267291': 2, '22720312': 1, '28819577': 2, '21340256': 1, '20718198': 1, '19034986': 1, '31463429': 1, '31689793': 1, '19223375': 1, '18023108': 1, '23325495': 1, '19701981': 1, '19581747': 1, '8473080': 1, '10982052': 1, '23669477': 1, '22977800': 2, '31292813': 2, '11333103': 1, '25956067': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2822253-1': 1, '6620227-1': 1, '5023863-1': 1, '3429734-1': 1, '5551536-1': 1, '4222587-1': 1}"}
