He told his parents he accidentally aspirated the base cap of a pen, subsequently developing breathlessness and cough. He was immediately taken to a private health facility where he had an emergency rigid bronchoscopy, but the FB was not found. He was given medications, got slightly better, and discharged home. He re-presented at two tertiary hospitals where repeat bronchoscopies were performed 4 weeks apart which failed to demonstrate any FB. He was diagnosed to have asthma, treated accordingly, and improved symptomatically on bronchodilators.\\nHe was admitted at our hospital following symptom recurrence. A chest x-ray done at presentation appeared normal and repeat rigid bronchoscopy was performed at his parents\u2019 request. A pedunculated subglottic mass was identified and excised. The patient improved remarkably and was discharged home 24 h later. Histology of the mass was reported as fibrocartilaginous tissue devoid of epithelium.\\nAbout 2 weeks later, he re-presented with severe respiratory distress. A neck and chest CT was requested which demonstrated a thin mass just above and straddling the carina [].\\nHe had repeat combined flexible and rigid bronchoscopy which identified the FB covered with granulation tissue which was then successfully extracted [Figures and ]. Postbronchoscopy recovery was uneventful and he was discharged home 24 h later with complete symptom resolution.", "age": "[[6.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'21409898': 1, '21670786': 1, '19693462': 1, '34306593': 1, '25047313': 1, '22782601': 1, '17669779': 1, '15831667': 1, '22951197': 1, '3209937': 1, '17728968': 1, '20559470': 1, '19446848': 1, '24009807': 1, '33680878': 1, '25768933': 1, '25388230': 1, '25857247': 1, '14680912': 1, '23119597': 1, '12118268': 1, '17033800': 1, '18439461': 1, '24970976': 1, '28584516': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
