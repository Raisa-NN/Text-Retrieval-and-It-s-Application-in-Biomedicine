The bag was detached around the right zygomatic region affected by tissue loss; we used vascularization of the orbicularis oculi muscle to perform the graft (Figures , , , , ).\\nA small graft was also placed in the right superior palpebral sulcus. Besides, blepharoplasty of the left upper eyelid was also performed; in this way, we corrected the palpebral asymmetry that the patient complained.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'10654732': 1, '16418657': 1, '28280534': 1, '22649284': 1, '8942902': 1, '1750860': 1, '12903010': 1, '33137925': 1, '16052135': 1, '28423354': 1, '22429738': 2, '15377992': 1, '25848312': 1, '16682130': 1, '33456697': 1, '8047602': 1, '9142473': 1, '8159427': 1, '16651956': 1, '7569029': 1, '10863068': 1, '2304989': 1, '1155565': 1, '8049045': 1, '21205320': 2, '11134213': 1, '23217096': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3022892-1': 1, '3323463-1': 1}"}
