He complained of a recent increase in snoring, apnea attacks, and swallowing difficulties. There was no mass on the neck palpation. Physical examination revealed a bulging of the anterior pillar of the palatal tonsil resulting in slight obstruction of the upper airway.\\nThe patient underwent neck MRI with gadolinium injection (). It revealed a well-defined 52 \u00d7 38 mm tumor of the right PPS, which was hypointense on T1-weighted sequences and hyperintense on T2. There was a displacement of the right oropharyngeal wall medially. It was independent of the deep lobe of the parotid. These MRI features were consistent with PA with possible focal areas of malignant degeneration in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences.\\nThe tumor was not extirpable through the transoral approach alone. A combined approach associating cervico-parotid and transoral incisions was therefore necessary. This approach allowed the exposure of the facial nerve avoiding its damage.\\nThe postoperative course was uneventful apart from House's grade III facial palsy which regressed using corticosteroids.\\nDefinitive histology was consistent with encapsulated pleomorphic adenoma.\\nNB: the patient has given his consent for the MRI images to be used for research and the case to be published.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27734977': 1, '28407991': 1, '8774924': 1, '18261527': 1, '25708410': 1, '31353995': 1, '25448637': 1, '24589290': 1, '6325567': 1, '34513108': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
