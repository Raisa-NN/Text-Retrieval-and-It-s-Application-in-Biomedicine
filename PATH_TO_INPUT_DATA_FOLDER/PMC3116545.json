The RE had poor vision since childhood. BCVA in RE was 20/2000 and in LE 20/32 N8. Anterior segment and intraocular pressures were unremarkable. Fundus evaluation of the RE revealed a large choroidal coloboma involving the disc and macula. The left fundus showed a normal disc and choroidal coloboma sparing the macula. There was a grayish lesion adjacent to the upper border of the coloboma with a streak of subretinal hemorrhage and subretinal fluid extending under the fovea. FFA showed a juxtafoveal classic CNV [] and OCT showed the presence of associated subfoveal fluid []. After a detailed discussion with the patient regarding treatment options including laser photocoagulation, PDT and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monotherapy, he underwent reduced fluence PDT with verteporfin followed 48 h later by an intravitreal injection of 0.05 ml bevacizumab (1.25 mg). Five months post treatment, BCVA was 20/20 N6 in LE with regressed CNV and absence of subretinal fluid on OCT [].", "age": "[[35.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12972787': 1, '11030819': 1, '30846457': 1, '18463509': 1, '24881602': 1, '28299000': 1, '33746210': 1, '12788148': 1, '9475031': 1, '2416022': 1, '22937507': 1, '27053995': 1, '16151482': 1, '33623357': 1, '33058409': 1, '17309012': 1, '27795796': 2, '29643788': 1, '33472799': 1, '18625940': 1, '32102810': 1, '2029115': 1, '21350286': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3116545-1': 2, '3116545-2': 2, '5072854-1': 1, '5072854-2': 1}"}
