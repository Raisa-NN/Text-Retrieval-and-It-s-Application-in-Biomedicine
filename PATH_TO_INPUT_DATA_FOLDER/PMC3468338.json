The patient was born to a multi-gravida with no perinatal problem. The patient had infrequent episodes of non-bilious vomiting since birth for which occasionally medical treatment was sought.\\nHowever, for the last 3 months the parents had noted an epigastric lump associated with abdominal pain. On examination, a vague mass was palpable in the epigastrium with no visceromegaly. There was tenderness on deep palpation. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed a 5 cm x 4 cm sized thick walled cyst in the epigastrium. CT scan of the abdomen also revealed a 5 cm x 5 cm sized cyst between the duodenum and the liver with wall enhancement, suggestive of duplication cyst (Fig. 1).\\nLaboratory parameters were within normal limits. At operation, a cyst along the pylorus and first part of the duodenum was found (Fig. 2). The cyst was opened that showed a mucosal lined cavity having mucus in it (Fig. 3). As the cyst was not separable from the gut therefore, excision of the free part of the cyst and mucosal stripping of the rest was performed. The patient recovered well postoperatively. She is doing well at one year follow-up. The histopathology of the specimen showed a gastric mucosal lined tissue having smooth muscles in the wall.", "age": "[[1.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'32884929': 1, '22529556': 2, '22953309': 1, '19138408': 2, '23061035': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2631535-1': 1, '3326830-1': 1}"}
