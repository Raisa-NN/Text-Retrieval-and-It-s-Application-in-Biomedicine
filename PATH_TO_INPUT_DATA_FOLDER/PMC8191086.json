His mother denied systemic diseases or a history of drug allergy, but she noted that he had mouth breathing and snoring habits. The patient had a mandibular deficiency similar to that of his father. Facial and temporomandibular joint examinations showed a bilaterally symmetrical raised face and normal temporomandibular joints. Oral examination showed the stage of dentition replacement, a molar distal relationship, deep overbite, deep overjet, 11 and 21 tipping, 0.5-mm spaces in 11 and 21, a narrow upper dental arch, a highly arched palatal cover, crowded lower front teeth, and 3-mm offsetting of the mandibular midline to the right ().\\nA preoperative panoramic radiograph () on 6 December 2013 showed the stage of mixed dentition; a normal number of teeth; a normal order of replaced teeth; caries of dental crowns at 55, 54, 74, 84, and 85; periapical lesions of 74; and disappearance of the dental follicle and ectopic tooth germ of 34. Cephalometric analysis () showed maxillary excess (SNA of 85.8\u00b0), normal mandibular development (SNB of 79\u00b0), skeletal class II (ANB of 6.3\u00b0), even angles, protrusion of the upper anterior teeth, and lingual inclination of the lower anterior teeth. The adenoid-nasopharyngeal ratio was 0.69, suggesting moderate adenoid hypertrophy. Estimation from Moyers\u2019 table showed moderate upper dentition crowding (\u22126 mm) and mild lower dentition crowding (\u22122 mm). The patient failed a water holding test. He was diagnosed with mouth breathing and skeletal class II malocclusion.\\nOdontotherapy: Necrotic tissue was removed and a filling was placed at 54, and 74 was removed (before the correction). A maxillary spiral expander () was used to improve crowding (for 3 months from December 2013 to March 2014), and lip closure exercises were intensified (15 minutes every day until the end of the correction). Fixed correction using a 2 \u00d7 4 appliance () was performed to align the front teeth, and a transpalatal arch was used to maintain the gaps between the front teeth and the lower hyoid arch (for 3 months from April 2014 to July 2014). The ETA was worn at night, and lip stickers were used to help intervene in mouth breathing (for 6 months from August 2014 to January 2015). Retaining stage: A Hawley retaining appliance () was worn in the daytime (for 6 months from February 2015 to September 2015), and the ETA () was worn during sleep at night to retain eruption induction-based occlusion development.\\nAt the 5-year 2-month post-correction follow-up visit (when the patient was 13 years old), the patient had stable occlusion, a coordinated osteofascial pattern, and normal tooth bodies, periodontium, and temporomandibular joints ().
