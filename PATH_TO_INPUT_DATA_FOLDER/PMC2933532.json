Clinical and radiologic examination revealed adequate hard and soft tissue dimensions for implant placement. A 3.0 \u00d7 15 mm single piece implant$ was placed in relation to #11 with good primary stability. In two weeks\u2019 time patient presented with signs of peri-implant mucositis and mobility. The implant was removed the subsequent week.\\nThe existence of a periapical pathology necessitated extraction of the tooth after failure of endodontic therapy. Although there was no radiographic evidence of any pathology in the periapical region at the site of implant placement, the previous periapical pathology[] had obviously not resolved. These sites may be considered to be at greater risk for implant placement and underlies the value of evaluation of the suspected sites with more sensitive investigative procedures such as CT scan. Economic considerations may preclude the use of such procedure routinely, but the suspected sites have to be evaluated with CT scan to avoid such retrograde implant failures.", "age": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'6929901': 1, '8228754': 1, '18421465': 1, '12453017': 1, '10697940': 1, '16104972': 1, '11432661': 1, '16731377': 1, '10531735': 1, '9663096': 1, '18926740': 1, '16878068': 1, '18433385': 1, '11208196': 1, '2094653': 1, '12950847': 1, '11315428': 1, '20922082': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2933532-1': 2, '2933532-2': 2, '2933532-3': 2}"}
