Her past medical history was significant for frequent respiratory tract infections in her childhood which were treated as upper respiratory tract infections with antibiotics and she was discharged from the hospital. The reason for these frequent infections was never been thoroughly investigated. On examination, she was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure of 130/80, heart rate of 86, and respiratory rate of 20. Her cardiac and respiratory examinations were normal. Her chest x-ray showed a curvilinear opacity adjacent to her right heart border. Bronchovascular markings were prominent on the right side []. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. The finding of the x-ray raised the suspicion of the admitting physician to order computed tomography (CT) chest that revealed dilated curvilinear pulmonary vein, which appeared to drain into the IVC. The diagnosis of scimitar syndrome (partial anomalous pulmonary venous return) was suspected [Figures and ]. TEE showed single anomalous pulmonary vein entering at the junction of right atrium and IVC [].\\nRHC showed significant left to right shunt (Qp/Qs ratio was 3.25) and elevated pulmonary artery pressure at 40 mmHg []. She was diagnosed with scimitar syndrome, and she was scheduled for repair of her partial anomalous pulmonary venous return.", "age": "[[18.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21983773': 1, '8354827': 1, '8911312': 1, '9494476': 1, '1642189': 1, '22985724': 1, '2682021': 1, '21883462': 1, '14426379': 1, '10086541': 1, '22697320': 1, '27011949': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
