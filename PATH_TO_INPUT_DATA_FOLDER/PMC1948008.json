On physical examination severe abdominal tenderness was marked, localized to the right lower abdomen aggravated on walking and coughing. His temperature was 37.8 degrees celcius and his pulse rate 92 bpm. Laboratory investigation disclosed a white blood count of 16,800/mm3, neutrofils 72% with left shift and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP).\\nAll other hematological and biochemical parameters were within normal range. Clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggested acute appendicitis and laparotomy was performed. Through a right paramedian subumbilical incision the right iliac fossa was explored and a grossly inflamed omental mass was revealed and resected. (Fig. ).\\nA small amount of fluid was seen. The appendix was macroscopically normal and no other cause of acute abdomen was identified. The pathology of the surgical specimen reported primary omentitis.
