One month prior to hospitalization, he received neoadjuvant chemotherapy twice. He underwent marginal mandibulectomy, left supraomohyoid neck dissection, and reconstruction with reconstruction plate and right radial forearm free flap under general anesthesia. He had no medical morbidities including hypertension or diabetes. Preoperative laboratory findings and chest radiograph were normal. The electrocardiogram (ECG) finding was sinus arrhythmia with low voltage in frontal leads and ST elevation, but a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was normal. He remained hemodynamically stable throughout the perioperative time. After surgery, the patient was transported to the intensive care unit (ICU) for postoperative care. During transport, a nasotracheal tube (NTT) remained in his airway, and ventilation was assisted with Ambu bagging (oxygen: 7 L/min) and 100% peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2). On arrival at the ICU, the patient's vital signs were taken. Both his blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were elevated. He complained of pain and analgesics were administered followed by opioids. BP remained high (259/115 mmHg) while HR surged (168 beats/min). He complained of persistent pain with agitating. For sedation and pain control, dexmedetomidine was administered. Under sedation, respiratory rate and SpO2 dropped to 7 breaths/min and 89% respectively. Because of sedatives, BP was dropped. ST elevation was showed in ECG monitor, so further evaluation, serial ECGs was checked and revealed ST elevation in the anterior and lateral leads. The cardiac markers were elevated. Myoglobin measurements surged to 1275.8 ng/ml; Troponin I measurements rose to 6.32 ng/ml; serum creatine kinase MB peaked at 55.6 ng/ml.\\nFor further evaluation, the patient was referred to the cardiology department. Cardiologists performed TTE, although it was limited by the patient's fixed supine position and the presence of a ventilator. Results showed a dilated left ventricular (LV) with normal LV wall thickness. Akinesia of apical lateral, inferior wall and mid-cavity with severe systolic dysfunction were observed (). LV ventriculogram showed an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 25%. The features showed ischemic insult of multivessel territory and stress-induced cardiomyopathy was suspected.\\nThe patient was transferred to a medical ICU where he was managed conservatively with inotropics, chronotropics and diuretics with hemodynamic monitoring. Dopamine 5 \u00b5g/kg/min, dobutamine 5 \u00b5g/kg/ min, norepinephrine 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/min were administered. He experienced a rapid clinical improvement. By the third postoperative day, previous ST-segment elevations were normalized. He was extubated on the fifth postoperative day and transferred to a general ward in the dental hospital. Troponin I levels normalized, and all laboratory test values were within normal ranges. One month later, TTE showed no evidence of cardiac ischemia and a left ventricular EF of 63%, a result similar to his preoperative result. No clinical signs of heart failure were found.\\nFollowing surgery, the patient received consolidation\\nradiotherapy (total dose: 5040 cGy). Currently the patient\\nis in good condition. Oral cavity lesions were healing\\nwell. Complete dentures are being prepared to provide\\nhim with masticatory function.
