No other cases were reported in her family. Skin examination revealed\\nmarked atrophy of the skin on the back of the hands and feet, as well as a few scattered\\nerosions/resolving blisters (). There was\\nextensive dyschromia on the limbs and trunk (). We also noted a loss of dermatoglyphics on her fingers. Examination of her\\nmouth showed erosive stomatitis. She also reported esophageal, vaginal and anal\\ninflammation, leading to stricture formation, requiring surgical correction. A skin\\nbiopsy showed disruption of dermal collagen bundles and a focal reduction in elastic\\nfibers (). DNA was extracted from\\nperipheral leucocytes and used to sequence the FERMT1 gene. Two\\nheterozygous mutations were identified: the change c.328C>T results in the creation\\nof a nonsense mutation, p.Arg110X and the insertion c.866insGG leads to a frameshift and\\na premature termination codon 7 amino acids downstream, p.Ala289GlufsX7 ().", "age": "[[28.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20507384': 1, '19945623': 1, '32973952': 1, '17916195': 1, '33202040': 1, '26375235': 1, '21936020': 1, '19945624': 1, '20938162': 1, '21308310': 1, '17854379': 1, '19200189': 1, '19067879': 1, '24346923': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
