He had severe developmental delay, manifesting as sitting independently but unstably, he couldn't say any words and only made a babbling sound by the time of our follow-up. He began to develop epileptic seizures 5 months after birth, characterized by a tonic seizure in one limb and, later, evolving into generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures. EEG showed widespread slow waves and spike slow waves during sleep and wide 3\u20134 Hz slow waves, especially in para-midline and midline regions, during waking and sleeping stages (). He was diagnosed as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. His brain MRI and serum Mg2+ concentrations were normal. The child has taken a total of three antiepileptic drugs including diazepam, levetiracetam, and topiramate, the latter two are currently used, but the seizures have not been controlled. He was born at 36 6/7 weeks of gestation with normal delivery. His family history was unremarkable.", "age": "[[2.0, 'year'], [10.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'34232746': 1, '31705535': 1, '24082052': 1, '29499166': 1, '30388404': 1, '16139684': 1, '2842249': 1, '27378932': 1, '31695023': 1, '25741868': 1, '30842972': 1, '23416519': 1, '27966362': 1, '24089211': 1, '31373411': 1, '23913004': 1, '33968856': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8098805-1': 2}"}
