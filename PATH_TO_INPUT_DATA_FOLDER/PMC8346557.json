At the initial visit, ME was noted on OCT images, which showed relatively large cystoid spaces in the INL, large cystoid spaces in the OPL, and subretinal detachment (Fig. A). The border between the INL and OPL was not smooth (Fig. B), and the JR was 1.21. The patient was treated with six anti-VEGF injections over the 12-month study period.", "age": "[[64.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'27471827': 1, '6383055': 1, '24112944': 1, '24439442': 1, '31167729': 1, '23308037': 1, '30073360': 1, '20398941': 1, '33323902': 1, '19672216': 1, '22930834': 1, '20430447': 1, '25315663': 1, '31465100': 1, '25574785': 1, '28384724': 1, '21337042': 1, '30954469': 1, '22301066': 1, '29624543': 1, '31732812': 1, '25704724': 1, '27328171': 1, '28837790': 1, '29545416': 1, '28232381': 1, '8618752': 1, '33436683': 1, '34362985': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8346557-1': 2}"}
