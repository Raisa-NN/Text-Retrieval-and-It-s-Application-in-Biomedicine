His CXR and CT thorax showed mediastinal mass compressing the left innominate vein and SVC []. He underwent both first-line (BEP) and second-line (TIP) chemotherapy and regimens. Two weeks after the second-line chemotherapy, his AFP and B-HCG were normalized but CT thorax showed increase in tumor size and persistent SVC compression. He underwent right hemiclamshell sternothoracotomy and resection of tumor with ligation of left innominate vein 5 weeks after chemotherapy []. Postoperatively, he was nursed in the ICU for a day. Other than transient left upper limb edema which resolved within 6 weeks after surgery, his recovery was unremarkable and discharged home at day 6 of surgery. His histopathology result showed matured teratoma with no viable tumor and margins consistent with fibrotic and necrotic tissue. Currently, he is 6 months after surgery with resolved SVC syndrome.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30646758': 1, '12518361': 1, '9262575': 1, '22713299': 1, '25406423': 1, '21610519': 1, '14752454': 1, '32002046': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6967146-1': 2}"}
