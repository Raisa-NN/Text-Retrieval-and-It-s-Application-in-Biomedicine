He was confused, looked unwell, had rigors and was too weak to stand. His temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, he was tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 26/minute and had oxygen saturations of 83% on air. He had cold peripheries, a pulse rate of 93/min and a blood pressure of 80/65 mmHg.\\nHis low oxygen saturations corrected with the administration of oxygen. Given the hypotension, tachycardia and pyrexia, both intravenous fluids and empirical ceftriaxone were begun.\\nFurther assessment found pale conjunctiva and yellow sclera. His abdomen was diffusely tender but the liver and spleen were not palpable. His examination was otherwise unremarkable.\\nHis malaria smear was negative and he was normoglycaemic (193 mg/dl). However his capillary blood haematocrit (Hct) was only 18% and his urine sample was almost black (Figure ). His urea and creatinine were elevated at 53.3 mg/dl and 2.1 mg/dl respectively. His full blood count showed white blood cell 21.6 x103 /\u03bcL, haemoglobin 6.9 g/dL and platelet count 136 \u00d7 103 /\u03bcL. It is possible that the leukocytosis could be a consequence of the haemolytic crisis itself []. Despite ceftriaxone therapy, the patient remained febrile with a leucocytosis at day three of admission. Given his clinical condition at this stage, gentamicin was added to his treatment and antibiotics were continued for a total of seven days. Acinetobacter baumannii was isolated from the admission blood culture: by disc testing using current CLSI criteria, the organism was sensitive to all drugs tested: amikacin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The clinical significance of this culture result is uncertain since the organism is usually responsible for infections in hospitalized patients [].\\nFollowing initial treatment the patient became coherent enough to answer questions appropriately. He was a Burmese construction worker working on the Thai-Burmese border. Following a four-day history of fever, he attended a local clinic where a malaria smear confirmed he had malaria. He received two types of tablets, but was unsure of their names. The patient identified the tablets, using examples of anti-malarial medications, to be chloroquine and primaquine. As reportedly prescribed, the patient took three chloroquine tablets a day (10 mg/kg) and one primaquine tablet (15 mg base) a day for the first two days. On the third day he took one-and-a-half chloroquine tablets (5 mg/kg) and one more primaquine tablet (15 mg base). He did note a change in colour of his urine on the third day but was not alarmed by this. On day four he could not remember the instructions of what to do with the eleven remaining primaquine tablets. The handwritten instructions were in Thai, which he was unable to read. His colleague translated the label, telling him he must finish all the tablets. Subsequently, the patient took the last eleven primaquine tablets in one go (165 mg base). Later that day the patient began to vomit and a severe abdominal pain ensued associated with black urine.\\nFollowing this additional history, a second malaria smear was performed, which still showed no evidence of malaria. A rapid fluorescent spot test showed the patient to be G6PD deficient even though after a massive haemolysis, a normal phenotype would be expected as older red blood cells (RBCs) are destroyed and new ones, with normal phenotype, are produced. A correct protocol to avoid misinterpretation of the test after haemolysis, which has not been applied here, would have been to separate older RBCs and assess G6PD activity only on them. Genotyping through the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was later applied to detect known G6PD mutations []. This confirmed that the patient was hemizygote for the Mahidol variant (Figure ).\\nAfter two 300 ml blood transfusions and ongoing intravenous fluids, the patients condition improved, his urine returned to normal and his Hct stabilized at 24%. At this level of anaemia, the local guidelines advise no further transfusion. The patient was discharged home on a treatment dose of ferrous sulphate (200 mg tds) and folic acid (5 mg od). A thorough explanation of the cause of his life-threatening illness was given to the patient in his own language and strict instructions, both verbal and written, explaining which medicines he should never take. Despite arranging follow-up to monitor the patient's renal function and anaemia, the patient did not return as he moved from the area.", "age": "[[35.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12643993': 1, '17106013': 1, '23965028': 1, '23297258': 1, '18046504': 1, '30701136': 1, '27720930': 1, '17611006': 1, '8571933': 1, '22182668': 1, '34127730': 1, '29082022': 1, '19233695': 1, '20007901': 1, '24833685': 1, '12654062': 1, '19248643': 1, '22586124': 1, '22523591': 1, '24014905': 1, '19064622': 1, '20963329': 1, '15569777': 1, '23537118': 1, '7949118': 1, '31031463': 1, '18682739': 1, '12041544': 1, '19349210': 1, '19050214': 1, '4386875': 1, '30379233': 1, '24228846': 1, '12445005': 1, '23152723': 1, '27530139': 1, '497122': 1, '9216462': 1, '22998791': 1, '7617034': 1, '27267757': 1, '17978087': 1, '22438279': 1, '25385861': 1, '31549159': 1, '31069260': 2, '11425182': 1, '21184691': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6480970-1': 1, '6480970-2': 1}"}
