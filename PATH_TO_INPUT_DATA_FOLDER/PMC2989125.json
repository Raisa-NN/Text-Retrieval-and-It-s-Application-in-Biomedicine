He had a symptomless swelling along the lateral aspect of the distal end of the leg. He was operated for distal end tibia fracture two years back by means of Ilizarov and fibular plate and again operated for tibial malunion by open reduction and plating one and half years back. The patient was having a normal gait. On examination a well-defined mass along the lateral aspect of the leg measuring 4 \u00d7 3 cm, oval to round shape, firm in consistency was found. There was no localized raised temperature, no abnormal vascularity. It was mobile painless and the skin over it was free and moving with the peroneal muscles. The surgical scar was overlying the mass. The laboratory investigation was normal. X-ray of the lower extremity and the ankle joint showed the soft tissue mass as a noncalcified tumefaction of the soft tissue adjacent to the fibular plate []. Surrounding bone was normal.\\nSurgical excision along with the implant removal was planned. On surgery a well-defined mass was found in the peroneal brevis musculature with well-defined borders and adjacent to the fibular bone []. It did not have any attachments with the surrounding structures and could be enucleated.\\nOn cutting the lesion on the operation table, gauze surrounded by the fibrous tissue was noted []. Histological examination revealed a large foreign body granuloma. There was no sign of malignancy.", "age": "[[29.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30203183': 1, '11822084': 1, '1545031': 1, '11499785': 1, '16417059': 1, '14530649': 2, '15851364': 1, '33623769': 2, '11786775': 1, '27298975': 2, '25207284': 1, '14632298': 1, '16763402': 1, '2680489': 1, '21139751': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'2698087-1': 1, '4719318-1': 1, '7885657-1': 1}"}
