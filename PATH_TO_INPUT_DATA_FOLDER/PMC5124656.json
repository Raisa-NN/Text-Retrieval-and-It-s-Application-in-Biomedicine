Removal of the fragment of the 11 revealed an almost complete detachment of the clinical crown with a deep palatal fracture line (Figures and ). Root canal therapy was required () and a flap was raised to surgically expose the palatal fracture margin through osteotomy (). Following root canal therapy the tooth fragment was prepared with mechanical retention, cleaned, etched (), and adhesively recemented using a heated composite. Once gingival healing was obtained, three months after trauma, it was decided to restore the two teeth with minimal preparation porcelain veneers to strengthen the labial surfaces (), as well as to improve aesthetics in masking the labial fracture of the two teeth () which were placed (), and after 18 months the papilla had reached full maturation and optimum aesthetic result ().", "age": "[[28.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'6963152': 1, '7890099': 1, '25084102': 1, '33623332': 1, '295156': 1, '9055474': 1, '7575967': 1, '8404697': 1, '12110103': 1, '10371912': 1, '11310111': 1, '15088736': 1, '16406084': 1, '21628685': 1, '22557895': 1, '22251277': 1, '16009415': 1, '32754457': 1, '23604697': 1, '6125593': 1, '15668328': 1, '15195730': 1, '6957469': 1, '11404871': 1, '11508092': 1, '18560650': 1, '10815593': 1, '8935108': 1, '279605': 1, '22770482': 1, '18717092': 1, '28740741': 2, '26575585': 1, '27965901': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5504940-1': 1}"}
