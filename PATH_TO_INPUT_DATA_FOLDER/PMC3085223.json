History of such episodes, prior hospitalization, tuberculosis or tuberculous contact was absent. On examination, he had heart rate of 130/min, respiratory rate of 54/min with severe respiratory distress and normal blood pressure. Bronchial breath sounds and crepitations were heard in right supra-mammary, mammary, infra-mammary and axillary areas with decreased breath sounds in left infra-axillary area. The central nervous system examination revealed stuporous sensorium and normal cranial nerve examination. He had hypotonia, depressed deep tendon reflexes and extensor plantar reflexes.\\nThe hemogram showed hemoglobin concentration of 10.8 g%, leukocyte count of 7800/\u03bcl with polymorphonuclear predominance and platelet count of 1,20,000/\u03bcl. Serum electrolytes and creatinine were normal. Liver transaminases were moderately elevated (ALT 347 and AST 108 IU/L, respectively). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed protein and sugar concentrations of 28 mg/dl and 66 mg/dl, respectively; with 2 lymphocytes and 15 RBCs on smear. CSF culture did not grow any organism. Mantoux test was non-reactive. Gastric aspirate was negative for acid fast bacilli. Blood and tracheal aspirate culture were negative. Chest radiograph showed right upper and middle zone pneumonia along with pleural effusion on the left side [], which was confirmed on ultrasonography. We could not perform the IFI test for detecting adenovirus. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of brain was normal. Pleural fluid appearance was hemorrhagic with protein concentration of 2.2 g% and 350 white cells per \u03bcL (90% lymphocytes, RBCs of 0.19 million). Smear examination and culture of CSF did not show presence of any organism. He was treated with anticonvulsants (phenytoin and phenobarbitone followed by midazolam infusion for repeated convulsions) and intravenous antibiotics (cefotaxime). He also required mechanical ventilation for his respiratory failure. In view of hemorrhagic pleural effusion and non-response to antibiotics, anti-tuberculous drug therapy was initiated. New infiltrates were seen on chest radiograph in right lower zone after eight days of mechanical ventilation (ventilator-associated pneumonia) [] and were treated with inj. vancomycin and meropenem. This treatment resulted in partial clinical response. He was ventilated for 10 days (maximum pressures used included a peak inspiratory pressure of 20cm in controlled mode and 16 cm in pressure-controlled synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation- SIMV mode). After extubation, he was put on oxygen by mask (FiO2 = 0.4). In view of hypoxemia (PaO2 = 27 mmHg; SaO2 = 54%), the FiO2 was increased with the help of non-rebreathing mask. CT scan of chest done at the end of 3 weeks showed multiple areas of consolidation in both the lung fields with ground glass opacities and mediastinal lymphadenopathy []. The patient showed gradual improvement in sensorium and complete control of convulsions. Gradually, the oxygen requirement could be reduced; but hypoxia persisted (room air PaO2 = 34; SaO2 = 67%) and he continued to have bilateral lung crepitations.\\nAt 10 weeks of hospitalization, in view of the clinical picture (chronic symptoms of cough and dyspnea), persistent desaturation at room air, radiological features (hyperinflation, ) and tomographic features (partially resolved consolidation and terminal bronchiolar dilatation with areas of air trapping; ), a diagnosis of BO was considered. He was treated with inhaled bronchodilators and therapy with oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) was initiated. This was followed by gradual increase in PaO2 and at the end of 21 days of steroid therapy, he was maintaining PaO2 on room air [ and ]. He could be discharged after a 16-week hospital stay. At eight months follow-up, he has bilateral basal crepitations, normal PaO2 on room air, normal chest radiograph and no neurological deficits. He is presently on tapering doses of oral prednisolone.", "age": "[[3.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'3342654': 1, '303485': 1, '11591545': 1, '16517579': 1, '4324685': 1, '19360848': 1, '8598989': 1, '3716407': 1, '6822090': 1, '9824023': 1, '21572753': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
