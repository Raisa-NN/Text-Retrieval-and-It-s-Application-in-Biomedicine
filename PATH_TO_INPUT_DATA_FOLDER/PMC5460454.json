Two TightRopes (Arthrex, Inc., Naples, Florida) were inserted arthroscopically to reduce the AC joint anatomically. The patient went to have a full and uneventful recovery. Eight months later, he got involved in a further cycling accident and reinjured his shoulder. Therefore, radiographs showed a redislocation of the AC joint (). Revision surgery was decided since the patient had high athletic demands.", "age": "[[24.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'20888260': 1, '16282577': 1, '18765674': 1, '22326545': 1, '20452245': 1, '12975181': 1, '6705384': 1, '8263989': 1, '4652050': 1, '16374588': 1, '7661261': 1, '20188268': 1, '12070493': 1, '22648748': 1, '33931095': 1, '25896983': 1, '28620415': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
