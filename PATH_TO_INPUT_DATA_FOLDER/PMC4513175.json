The patient had no previous history of anticoagulant therapy or hematological coagulopathy, and was in good health before this episode. On physical examination, he was alert and fully oriented. No neurologic abnormalities were found for cranial nerves or the cerebellar system. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed no evidence of any abnormality. However, lamina fractures of C6 and C7 and an irregular lesion of around 10\u00d710\u00d710mm filled with gas in the C6 vertebral body were visualized by CT (). The lesion did not communicate with the spinal canal or intervertebral disc. Conservative treatment including bed rest, O2 inhalation, and medication for pain relief was administered. A follow-up CT scan taken 3 days after injury revealed that the intravertebral gas had completely resolved with no further complication (). The patient remained in good health and was free of neurological deficits during the 3-month follow-up period.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25760515': 1, '9423641': 1, '19096597': 1, '12185040': 1, '2717951': 1, '7955897': 1, '3383864': 1, '13679296': 1, '25983848': 2, '11587521': 1, '26217389': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4430565-1': 1, '4430565-2': 1}"}
