A physical examination revealed a round mass of \u223c7 cm in diameter. No palpable lymph nodes or other masses of the contralateral breast were detected. The ultrasonography of the lesion revealed a solid, heterogeneous echogenic mass with smooth margins, measuring 5\u00d72 cm. A excisional biopsy was performed on the right breast, and a 6.7\u00d74.6\u00d74.5-cm, greyish-white colored, oval-shaped, encapsulated mass was found upon gross examination (). In addition, small cystic spaces were detected on the cut surface. Histopathologically, the tumor consisted of mammary glandular tissue in hyalinized fibrous stroma, interspersed with islands of mature fatty tissue (). Cystic ducts with apocrine metaplasia were evident in specific areas as fibrocystic changes. All lobules were structurally normal. The lesion was well-defined and had a pseudocapsule of compressed adjacent breast tissue. This case was consequently diagnosed as a fibroadenolipoma.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12565210': 1, '10882247': 1, '16720843': 1, '5096305': 1, '3563443': 1, '10517440': 1, '26550075': 1, '16438081': 1, '1866672': 1, '24137343': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3789047-1': 2}"}
