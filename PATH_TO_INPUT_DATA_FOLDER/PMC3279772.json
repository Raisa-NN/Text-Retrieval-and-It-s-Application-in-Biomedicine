Nasal obstruction was of gradual onset, non progressive, more on the left side than right. Nasal obstruction did not respond to standard medical treatment and was of recurrent nature. The nasal discharge was intermittent, purulent and nonfoul smelling. There was no history of hemifacial pain, ear discharge, ear ache, nasal trauma or previous nasal surgery. No history of any allergies to drugs or food products was present. Systemic history was uneventful.\\nOn examination the nose showed external parrot beak deformity and there was mild external deviation of the nose to the right. Nasal septum was deviated to right inferiorly, and towards left superiorly. There was Candal deviation to left. Nasal patency was decreased on the right side and Cottle's test was positive. No sinus tenderness could be elicited.\\nDifferential leukocyte count of the patient showed eosinophilia suggesting an allergic etiology and the Non Contrast CT PNS revealed a deviated nasal septum towards right, bilateral concha bullosa, mucosal thickening in left frontal recess, left anterior ethmoidal air cells and right sphenoidal sinus and bilateral inferior turbinates. Near total opacification in both maxillary sinuses with blocked osteomeatal units were seen (). There was no bony erosion or invasion on CT scan. The major CT feature of allergic sinusitis is the presence of a soft tissue mass within the involved sinus, seen on unenhanced studies (). Failing any improvement on medical therapy, bilateral fibreoptic endoscopic sinus surgery with septoplasty was planned under GA and the biopsy was excised and sent for fungal culture.\\nBoth Gram staining of the impression smears of the tissue crushed between two sterile slides and 10% KOH preparation showed the presence of fungal hyphae. Biopsy material was inoculated on a set of Sabouraud dextrose agar with and without antibiotics and one tube of each set was incubated at 22\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C respectively. On the 5th day of incubation, a black colored wooly growth was seen in all four tubes. The LPCB preparation of the growth showed phaeoid septate hyphae with internodal branching and macroconidia with alternate septations similar in morphology to Alternaria, but the presence of verrucose, muriform macroconidia borne from short geniculate conidiophores showing 2-3 transverse septa and 1-2 longitudinal and/ or oblique septation indicated towards Ulocladium spp. A slide culture was done and the absence of chains of macroconidia ruled out Alternaria spp. and confirmed the fungi to be Ulocladium botrytis morphologically ().", "age": "[[35.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'9396646': 1, '15310343': 1, '19330659': 1, '12816160': 1, '7970796': 1, '18598832': 1, '15597677': 1, '9616249': 1, '18663658': 1, '9768578': 1, '1865728': 1, '11482530': 1, '15151286': 1, '23762621': 1, '16517929': 1, '7194869': 1, '22347556': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
