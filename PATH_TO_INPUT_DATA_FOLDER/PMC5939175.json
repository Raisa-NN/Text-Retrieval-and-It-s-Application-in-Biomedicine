His vision with spectacles was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/32 in the left eye. Anterior segment was normal, and dilated fundus evaluation revealed bilateral moderate optic disc edema [Fig. and ]. The disc and peripapillary edema was confirmed and quantified using optical coherence tomography [], and visual fields showed an enlarged physiological blind spot []. Subsequently, the patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography which were both normal. A lumbar puncture was done which revealed raised intracranial pressure (300 mmH2O) with normal cellularity and chemistry results. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of intracranial hypertension with papilledema was made.\\nOn further questioning, the mother reported that her son was on oral fluvoxamine (100 mg/day) that was initiated by psychiatrist for OCD 2 years back. In view of the possible drug-induced intracranial hypertension, fluvoxamine was discontinued immediately, and the patient was started on oral acetazolamide. Within 2 weeks, the papilledema had started resolving [Fig. and and ] and by 4 months had completely resolved [Fig. and and ]. There was mild temporal disc pallor with normal visual acuity, visual fields, and color vision.", "age": "[[10.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22963896': 1, '27308085': 1, '21519224': 1, '19198698': 1, '19393521': 1, '6822621': 1, '8929615': 1, '28806347': 1, '27918771': 1, '2931729': 1, '27786584': 1, '29676327': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
