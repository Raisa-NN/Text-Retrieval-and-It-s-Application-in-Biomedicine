In the laboratory examinations, she had a negative rheumatoid factor and anti-ccp, elevated ESR (87 mm/h) and CRP (45 mg/l), and leukocytosis (13.4 \u00d7 103/ul). In the disease course, she was under the treatment of oral Methotrexate (10 mg/week), Sulfasalazine (2000 mg/day), Naproxen (500 mg/day), and prednisolone (7.5 mg/day). This patient, as the previous case, could not afford biologic drugs. In this regrad, we started oral cyclosporine A (3mg/kg) due to refractoriness to conventional DMARDs. We injected both knees by Triamcinolone in two intervals. After three weeks, patient felt better and disease activity index, ESR, CRP and leukocytosis improved.\\nHowever, after the dose reduction in each time, clinical and laboratory signs of disease relapsed. In this respect, after signing the inform consent by the patient, we decided to start intravenous pamidronate 60 mg per month until three months. After four weeks, laboratory and clinical signs of the patient decreased and after eight weeks, the entire patient's joint tenderness improved. Swelling disappeared in all joints except in one knee ().\\nEven so, we gradually started to tapered drugs. After 3 months of the last infusion, the patient only received one-gram oral Sulfasalazine per day and other drugs were discontinued.", "age": "[[23.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'15338492': 1, '21330639': 1, '18051699': 1, '9142965': 1, '11247319': 1, '23626604': 1, '7869303': 1, '22091296': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3214385-1': 2}"}
