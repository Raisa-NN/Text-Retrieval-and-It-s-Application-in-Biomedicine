She had undergone bilateral cataract surgery 5 years earlier, and her BCVA had recovered to 1.0, but there was a gradual development of macular edema. She received 2 sub-Tenon injections of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 intravitreal injections of aflibercept, and focal laser treatment in her left eye. She received 1 intravitreal injection of aflibercept and a focal laser treatment in her right eye. Despite these treatments, the CRT was still 613 \u03bcm in the right eye () and 412 \u03bcm in the left eye (); although, the decimal BCVA was 1.0 in both eyes. Her BCVAs were maintained, and she did not agree to continue anti-VEGF therapy. Oral luseogliflozin 2.5 mg was administered, and the CRT of both eyes ( and (D)) began to decrease by two weeks after commencing the luseogliflozin. This reduction continued for six months. Six months later, her CRT was reduced to 451 \u03bcm in the right eye () and 273 \u03bcm in the left eye (). The BCVA was maintained at 1.0 in both eyes. Her body weight was reduced at six months, and the glycated hemoglobin A1c was reduced from 6.5% to 6.1% at six months ().", "age": "[[61.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26488032': 1, '29392288': 1, '26378978': 1, '27299675': 1, '9989248': 1, '30123844': 1, '25692915': 1, '29670074': 1, '34311786': 2, '30123269': 1, '32542431': 1, '21459215': 1, '30204303': 1, '25402275': 1, '31853361': 1, '28535208': 1, '33274092': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7683151-1': 2, '7683151-2': 2, '8314493-1': 1}"}
