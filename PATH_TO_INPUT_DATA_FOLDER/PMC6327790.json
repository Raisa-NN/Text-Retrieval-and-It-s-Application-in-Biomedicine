He was diagnosed of having TMJ fracture. The plan was closed reduction and arch bar placement under general anesthesia (GA). The patient was nasally intubated. The pack was placed by the anesthesiologist. In the operating room, on the white board in bold letters \u201cThroat Pack In\u201d was written along with its time of placement. Occlusion was achieved and intermaxillary fixation (IMF) was released; the patient was extubated and shifted to the recovery with stable vitals.\\nNurse informed of an unaccounted pack while erasing the whiteboard. The patient was shifted back to the operation theater. Direct laryngoscopy revealed no signs of pack. A fine suction catheter was passed through the nostrils hoping that the pack was lodged in the nasopharynx. There was free movement of the suction catheter indicating its absence in the nasopharynx.\\nThe pack used was a plain roll gauze, and the use of C-arm to localize was ruled out. With the help of gastroenterologist, endoscopy was performed under sedation. Pack had partly crossed the pyloric sphincter of the gastrointestinal tract. The foreign body was removed endoscopically without complications []. Postoperatively, the family was explained about the missing throat pack. Recovery was uneventful. IMF was done after the patient was alert. The patient was discharged.", "age": "[[23.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'33776116': 1, '7304892': 1, '922384': 1, '6859513': 1, '34984149': 2, '11284845': 1, '9233108': 1, '30693260': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8715833-1': 1}"}
