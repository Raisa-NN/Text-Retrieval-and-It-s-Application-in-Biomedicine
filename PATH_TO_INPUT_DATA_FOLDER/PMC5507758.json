In the field, ventricular fibrillation reverted to sinus rhythm after 3 minutes of advanced life care. Paralytics were administered and intubation was performed with a resultant GCS of 3T one hour prior to presentation to the trauma bay. Upon presentation, GCS was 11T and 4 mm pupils were reactive to light.\\nHead CT revealed multifocal hemorrhagic contusions and edema along the cerebral convexities, complex and nondisplaced skull fractures along the projectile trajectory from the right to left parietal skull. The retained high-velocity projectile was in the left parietal bone (Figure ).\\nThe decision was made to perform an immediate craniotomy. Initially tissue was debrided from the right parietal region. A left craniotomy then revealed a depressed skull fracture, which was elevated followed by removal of the high-velocity projectile from the left parietal bone with debridement of devitalized brain. Cranioplasty was then performed bilaterally.\\nPost-operative head CT revealed a retained projectile and bone fragments along the trajectory. In addition, projectile fragments remained adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus which required anticoagulation due to the risk of sinus thrombosis (Figure ). At discharge to rehabilitation, his physical examination found him to be alert with intact cranial nerve examination, but with quadriparesis.", "age": "[[44.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'31973644': 1, '34648362': 2, '21887033': 1, '2259398': 1, '18140655': 1, '28706766': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5507758-1': 2, '5507758-2': 2, '8521775-1': 1}"}
