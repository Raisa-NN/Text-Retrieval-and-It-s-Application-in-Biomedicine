Patient was apprehensive and looked pale. Patient had passed stool in the morning with no history of blood or mucous in the stool. On per abdominal examination no lump was palpable. There were no signs of peritonitis. His laboratory investigations were within normal limits. Abdominal radiograph showed air fluid levels indicative of a small-bowel obstruction. Ultrasonography revealed ileo-ileal intussusception. After resuscitation, patient underwent emergency laparotomy. At operation an ileo-ileal intussusception was found (Fig. 1). The invaginated segment was situated approximately 40 cm from the ileo-cecal valve. The reduction of intussusception was carried out gently. After reduction the adjacent small intestine had a normal color and peristalsis. A firm polypoid mass was palpable in the lumen of ileum about 20 cm from ileo-cecal valve (Fig. 2,3). An enterotomy confirmed the presence of a polypoid lesion arising from antimesenteric border. This segment of ileum was resected and an end-to-end anastomosis performed. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Histopathological examination revealed that the mass was composed of mature pancreatic acini and ducts.", "age": "[[12.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17873463': 1, '30995913': 2, '23277888': 1, '7237066': 1, '15536284': 1, '28819577': 2, '10982052': 1, '7245042': 1, '19321685': 1, '14669092': 1, '16283338': 1, '27537551': 2, '31689793': 1, '22953306': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5551536-1': 1, '6472004-1': 1, '5370778-1': 1}"}
