Radiographic findings at that time revealed a 23 mm sized right temporal AVM fed by multiple branches of anterior temporal and posterior cerebral arteries, and he was treated by gamma knife radiosurgery. At this presentation, follow up DSA revealed no reduction in the size of the nidus.\\nAccordingly, the AVM nidus and feeding arteries were occluded partially with Onyx under local anesthesia. Vascular access, microcatheter superselection, and embolization with Onyx were done as described above, but again, the catheter was adhered to Onyx mass and could not be removed. The catheter was transected at the groin puncture site and prescribed medications to prevent thromboembolic complications (). The patient underwent second gamma knife radiosurgery of the remnant nidus at 6 days after embolization.", "age": "[[31.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'23907974': 1, '24623586': 1, '11334300': 1, '18728613': 1, '17213451': 1, '9974078': 1, '17297015': 1, '3550522': 1, '20584469': 1, '3760956': 1, '18824988': 1, '8584142': 1, '23685793': 1, '20190210': 1, '18842759': 1, '20465885': 1, '18728607': 1, '20584470': 1, '17367073': 1, '8416244': 1, '12690217': 1, '22949969': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3424180-1': 2}"}
