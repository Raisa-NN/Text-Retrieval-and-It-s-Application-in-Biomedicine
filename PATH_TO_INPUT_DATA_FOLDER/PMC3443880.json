Five years later a system replacement (Maximo II DR D264DRM, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), due to a delayed device-related infection, was carried out. The new implanted device was programmed with three detection zones and corresponding therapies: ventricular tachycardia (VT-1) detection at 350 ms with antitachycardia pacing (ATP) and cardioversion (CV), fast ventricular tachycardia (VT-2) detection at 310 ms with ATP and CV and ventricular fibrillation (VF) detection at 260 ms with ATP during charging and defibrillation. Two months later, the patient was admitted to the emergency department due to a single nonsyncopal ICD shock. The stored intracardiac electrogram () showed a single arrhythmic episode classified as VF consisting of a regular monomorphic tachycardia with a mean cycle length of 250 ms with clearly different electrograms as compared with those in sinus rhythm, as well as atrio-ventricular dissociation, confirming true ventricular tachyarrhythmia. The ICD interrogation revealed no abnormal parameters for sensing and pacing. Antitachycardia pacing during charging correctly terminated the arrhythmia, achieving stable sinus rhythm. However, the device delivered a high-energy shock after completion of capacitors charging.
