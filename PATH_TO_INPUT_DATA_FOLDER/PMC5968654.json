He appeared confused and parents concluded it as dream. He was otherwise normal. He slept and ate more than his siblings and was obese. Few days later he again woke up from sleep screaming and his right hand was being pushed into his mouth bitten and bleeding and strangely his family noticed that his left hand was pushing his right hand into his mouth though it was injured and bleeding. The patient was unable to answer why his left hand is behaving so and he could not withdraw that. These episodes recurred in varying intervals with varying severity but he did not show any features of alien hand otherwise. Electroencephalogram showed a right parietal epileptic focus [] and MRI showed an area of gliosis in the right posterior parietooccipital region and minimal gliosis on the left side []. The patients attack stopped with antiepileptic medication suggesting an ictal alien hand syndrome. Ictal electroencephalography (VEEG) could not be done in this patient.", "age": "[[14.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30093760': 1, '8761626': 1, '13514485': 1, '12609183': 1, '17638304': 1, '3676696': 1, '9220259': 1, '4005534': 1, '7673948': 1, '2222983': 1, '21315264': 1, '9865803': 1, '18641433': 1, '19387980': 1, '29875540': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
