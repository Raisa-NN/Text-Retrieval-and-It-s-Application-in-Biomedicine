Avulsion occurred obliquely along the finger pad. The subcutaneous tissue attached to the avulsed finger was scarce, and vessel exploration for anastomosis was difficult. Thus, reconstruction with a thenar flap was performed (). The full-thickness skin graft, donated from the avulsed finger, was applied to the donor site. The flap was detached 2 weeks postoperatively (). Both the graft and flap showed complete survival. The skin graft matched well to the recipient site in terms of color and texture, with favorable reconstructed fingertip form (). No dysfunction was noted postoperatively.", "age": "[[22.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10751705': 1, '11252097': 1, '25257490': 1, '25767418': 1, '21492856': 1, '24018216': 1, '25746850': 1, '33621217': 1, '16023931': 1, '32128349': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7033701-1': 2, '7033701-2': 2, '7033701-3': 2}"}
