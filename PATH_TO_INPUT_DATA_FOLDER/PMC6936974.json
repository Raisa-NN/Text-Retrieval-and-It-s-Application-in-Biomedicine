He met the criteria for moderate separation anxiety disorder. Although able to go to a day care he had been attending since infancy, he showed distress at drop-off particularly at the start of each week, crying for 15 min. He feared being apart from his mother in the house: he could not tolerate his mother leaving the room even to change clothes and would cry if his mother left the playroom while K played with his father. He would get distressed if his father took him on outings without his mother. He could not be dropped off at a childcare centre at his parents\u2019 gym, leading to their avoiding exercise. He slept in his own crib, rocked to sleep by a parent, but would wake in a panic (alert but distressed) two to three times per month, crying for over an hour until his parents took him into their bed. K also was very particular about where objects were placed in the playroom and would fuss if they were put in the wrong place. He got anxious about deviations in routine (eg, taking a different path on a walk) and had trouble throwing things away (eg, used Band-Aids).", "age": "[[26.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'12240705': 1, '20810472': 1, '19000625': 1, '20658807': 1, '29064948': 1, '17138293': 1, '14561058': 1, '11097967': 1, '18377124': 1, '34744889': 1, '17572506': 1, '17565290': 1, '16832322': 1, '20467547': 1, '11686265': 1, '22018968': 1, '30056623': 1, '21440860': 1, '7726811': 1, '29718718': 1, '25692403': 1, '25798728': 1, '9204677': 1, '29335030': 1, '16492262': 1, '18415883': 1, '10599484': 1, '31922092': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6936974-1': 2}"}
