Initial examination revealed a term, healthy infant with a midsternal defect from which the heart was readily observable (Figure ). Pericardium partially covered the exposed heart. The patient was operated urgently upon arrival. At the operation, the sternum was found to be completely bifid. There was a persistent left superior vena cava and the PDA was ligated. Aorta, superior, and inferior vena cava were cannulated, and the 7-mm ASD was closed with primary suture under cardioplegic arrest. For closure of the thoracic defect, both sides of the sternum were mobilized by detaching the sternoclavicular joints. Pectoralis major muscles were also mobilized. These maneuvers facilitated partial approximation of the sternum with steel wire sutures and closure of muscle, fascia, and skin layers (Figure ). The patient had an uneventful recovery with a normal development at her latest follow-up at the age of five years (Figure ). A written informed consent was obtained from each parent for all diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.", "age": "[[7.0, 'day']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'968806': 1, '12797029': 1, '10921692': 1, '8901716': 1, '12614821': 1, '13592660': 1, '33768990': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7970079-1': 2}"}
