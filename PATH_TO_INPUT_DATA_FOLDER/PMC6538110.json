He reported normal development without cyanosis or functional limitation. On physical exam, III/VI holosystolic murmur and S4 were appreciated. The electrocardiogram demonstrated left axis deviation and Q waves in the early right precordial leads. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated atrial to ventricular (AV) and ventricular to arterial (VA) discordance consistent with corrected transposition of the great arteries, as seen in Figure . There was a restrictive perimembranous ventricular septal defect and moderate right ventricular dilation with decreased systemic right ventricular function. Following these findings, cardiac computed tomography angiography was performed to further assess the congenital anomaly, as seen in Figure .", "age": "[[37.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17317376': 1, '19033293': 1, '16216961': 1, '9588406': 1, '27777298': 1, '23747642': 1, '23972966': 1, '21565637': 1, '15687127': 1, '12530495': 1, '9743167': 1, '20519056': 1, '31183286': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
