The thresholds of PTA was 47.5 dB on right and 46 dB on left. The ABR result was the same as pure tone average with both threshold of 60 dB.

In the same way as above, we infused the stem cell into the central line.\\nAs the same above case, there was no associated complication systemically. He was also followed up for 12 months as one month interval with hearing test (PTA, OAE, ABR) but we also could not find any hearing improvement ().
