He had a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis and bilateral congenital cataracts. His arthritis had been considered as inactive for the last 2 years by his rheumatologist and remained inactive during the ophthalmologic process.\\nA thorough review of systems was unremarkable and he was diagnosed with PUK and initially treated with several systemic immunosuppressive agents including corticosteroids (1 mg/kg/day during relapses with further tapering) combined first with leflunomide (20 mg/day) and secondly with methotrexate without success. Two tectonic penetrant keratoplasties and several amniotic membrane graftings were also performed with subsequent relapses of his condition (Fig. ). Therapy with infliximab (5 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks) was then initiated but he developed an infusion reaction which required discontinuing therapy with infliximab and therapy with adalimumab (40 mg/2 weeks) was then initiated with subsequent control of his inflammatory condition. Twelve months after the initiation of therapy, the patient remains asymptomatic (Fig. ).", "age": "[[51.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26319144': 1, '19651317': 1, '21209123': 1, '20334454': 1, '17644538': 1, '19092414': 1, '12714388': 1, '28785483': 1, '16015096': 1, '22588776': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3500990-1': 2}"}
