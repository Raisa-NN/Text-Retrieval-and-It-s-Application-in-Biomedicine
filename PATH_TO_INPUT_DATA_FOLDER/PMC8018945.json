The patient had a history of multiple bloodstream infections treated with ceftazidime, rifampin, gentamicin, or intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on empiric vancomycin and gentamicin. Blood cultures grew out Enterobacter cloacae and SCV Enterobacter cloacae by MALDI-TOF and therapy was switched to cefepime. Additionally, the patient received ceftazidime line-lock therapy. The patient completed treatment and recovered fully. Though the isolates were resulted out as E. cloacae, they were later identified as E. hormaechei based on whole genome sequencing.", "age": "[[6.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'30507374': 1, '21266540': 1, '26960941': 1, '10473549': 1, '23684303': 1, '9882664': 1, '26670385': 1, '30479752': 2, '25165563': 1, '9244256': 1, '30988144': 1, '18779359': 1, '16769691': 1, '20711357': 1, '16430685': 1, '25888312': 1, '21253898': 1, '27019298': 1, '29205135': 1, '11904373': 1, '25120957': 1, '24766052': 1, '23485724': 1, '24951564': 1, '10834845': 1, '9705387': 1, '27606007': 1, '27310825': 1, '4911544': 1, '12813074': 1, '25926490': 1, '1779751': 1, '17135443': 1, '16428756': 1, '23563389': 1, '16651068': 1, '25073642': 1, '16541137': 1, '27840237': 1, '21219453': 1, '21012657': 1, '18850218': 1, '24452687': 1, '28336132': 1, '26310815': 1, '19605585': 1, '25738802': 1, '25690100': 1, '33811225': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8018945-1': 2, '8018945-2': 2, '6245536-1': 1}"}
