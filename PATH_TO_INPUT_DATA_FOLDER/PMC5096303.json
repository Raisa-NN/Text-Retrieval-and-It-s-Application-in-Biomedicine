Imaging revealed an area of abnormal T2 hyperintensity in the left insular region. He underwent a biopsy, which was nondiagnostic. Four months later, repeat imaging demonstrated an interval expansion of abnormal T2 hyperintensity. A second biopsy was performed, confirming an anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH1 wild-type. He was treated with conventional chemo-RT followed by 7 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. Imaging subsequently revealed a new area of abnormal enhancement in the medial left temporal lobe. He elected to initiate treatment with dose-intense temozolomide and concurrent TTFields therapy. NovoTAL mapping was performed utilizing the extent of the T2 hyperintense signal, rather than focusing solely on the small area of abnormal enhancement (Fig. ).", "age": "[[51.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26350296': 1, '24849088': 1, '24884522': 2, '25003941': 1, '33096667': 1, '28518093': 1, '32734509': 1, '24552318': 1, '15758009': 1, '20231676': 1, '17551011': 1, '31783910': 1, '26558989': 1, '15126372': 1, '27809808': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5096303-1': 2, '5096303-2': 2, '5096303-3': 2, '5096303-4': 2, '4036833-1': 1, '4036833-2': 1, '4036833-3': 1}"}
