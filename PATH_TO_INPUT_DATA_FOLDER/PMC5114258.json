A progressive foot contracture resulted in pain in the right foot during walking. All of the toes exhibited a dorsal flexion deformity ().\\nThe right foot was treated with skin contracture debridement and the second MTP with joint capsulotomy. EDL lengthening was performed from the second toe to the fourth toe. The size of the wound was 9 cm \u00d7 5 cm (). A 10 cm \u00d7 5 cm ALT flap was designed on the left thigh (). With the root of the perforating artery and vein ligated, the ALT flap was raised (). End-to-end anastomosis was performed between the perforating and dorsalis pedis arteries and to the veins (). The donor site was closed immediately.\\nThe flap survived, and at the 7-month follow-up, a debulking procedure was performed. No complications were reported at the final follow-up. The patient was satisfied with the aesthetic outcome and did not feel pain while walking after surgery ().", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'2039975': 1, '34818716': 2, '17198953': 1, '18724136': 1, '17573198': 1, '12045540': 1, '23345051': 1, '30147913': 2, '21351140': 1, '24375807': 1, '11525856': 1, '1633673': 1, '23653382': 1, '17169495': 1, '21991213': 1, '24390110': 1, '8884009': 1, '4144651': 1, '18846571': 1, '24038586': 1, '29352303': 1, '22009664': 1, '10665363': 1, '19610087': 1, '10624291': 1, '8115505': 1, '2246314': 1, '8792964': 1, '23280772': 1, '19670239': 1, '17004077': 1, '10513910': 1, '27904728': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5114258-1': 2, '6099008-1': 1, '8627940-1': 1, '8627940-2': 1, '8627940-3': 1}"}
