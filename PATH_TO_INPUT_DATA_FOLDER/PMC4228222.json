One month after the procedure, lesions developed on the left side of her face. She visited our hospital one month after lesion development. Gram staining and culture were negative. Staining for AFB and cultures for M. tuberculosis and NTM were performed along with a microscopic study. The AFB staining and the culture test were negative. Despite a series of negative results, the histopathology result showed a caseating granulomatous inflammation, which initially led to the assumption that this case was an NTM infection. Incision, drainage, and curettage were performed on the day of the clinic visit, and two additional surgical debridement procedures followed. As a result, the patient's symptoms improved within 2 weeks. The patient was given empirical antibiotics of oral clarithromycin (500 mg, q 12 hours) and moxifloxacin (400 mg/day) for six weeks since the first day of visit, and she stopped medication after the negative result of the NTM culture was confirmed. She was followed-up for 8 months without relapse; however, a depressed, contracted scar remained ().", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'18360653': 1, '8816144': 1, '21348540': 1, '10325313': 1, '17277290': 1, '22783486': 2, '6833792': 1, '18080159': 1, '17368631': 1, '22564831': 1, '17255691': 1, '12015697': 1, '11074697': 1, '21575304': 1, '19967012': 1, '24265954': 1, '10511409': 1, '17217137': 1, '21976944': 2, '19658440': 1, '25396192': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4228222-1': 2, '4228222-2': 2, '3178771-1': 1, '3385308-1': 1, '3385308-2': 1, '3385308-3': 1}"}
