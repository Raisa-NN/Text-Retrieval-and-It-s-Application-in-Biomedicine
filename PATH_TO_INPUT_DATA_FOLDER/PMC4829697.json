She reported suffering from perineal pain of an allodynic and hyperalgesic nature for more than 6 years. Further comorbidity included non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and a cerebrovascular accident with little functional impairment. Antineuropathic analgesics (tramadol, oxycodone, pregabalin, and amitriptyline) as well as minimal invasive techniques (right sided pulsed radio frequent lesion of nerve root S3, chemical neurolesion of Impar's ganglion, and hypogastric plexus block) for neuropathic pain treatment did not result in structural pain relief. Over the last 2 years, her pain had steadily become more intense, resulting in functional, psychological, sexual, and social dysfunction.\\nAfter discussing neuromodulation options, the patient consented to a stimulation trial of the 3rd SNR/DRG. Prior to implantation, a retrograde transforaminal paraesthesia mapping (RTPM) procedure of the right sided S3 nerve root was performed (this technique was described earlier []), producing 100% coverage of the painful area.", "age": "[[58.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22151059': 1, '21056357': 1, '31152179': 1, '24249588': 1, '22151711': 1, '24571400': 1, '22653388': 1, '23511681': 1, '22674567': 1, '19838740': 1, '21056397': 1, '9696470': 1, '21056393': 1, '19787710': 1, '27123351': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
