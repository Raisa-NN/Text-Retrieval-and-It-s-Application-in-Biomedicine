A 40 degree closing wedge lumbar osteotomy was performed at level L4, with pedicle screw fixation T10-S1. Postoperative plaster immobilization with a TLSO with one leg included was used for three months. Unfortunately, the pedicle screw fixation in S1 showed a breakout, resulting in loss of deformity correction at L4 (Figure ). Revision surgery was performed to restore the deformity correction and re-fixate the osteotomy. The patient was placed in prone position and the loss of deformity was corrected by extending the surgical table. The revised correction was re-fixated with bilateral iliac screws in a FB construct and additional posterior bone grafting (Figure and ). The spontaneously repositioned sacral screws were left in place knowing that they did not add any stability to the construct in the osteoporotic bone. At two years follow-up, the radiographs showed an unaltered reduction with no loss of correction and complete fusion.", "age": "[[44.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11923673': 1, '11547195': 1, '20195650': 1, '11295914': 1, '1810562': 1, '6474253': 1, '16544157': 1, '18544164': 1, '16985470': 1, '16721307': 1, '16449903': 1, '3357688': 1, '1523506': 1, '32875886': 1, '10413350': 1, '16326728': 1, '17572629': 1, '3280204': 1, '21489256': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3089781-1': 2, '3089781-2': 2}"}
