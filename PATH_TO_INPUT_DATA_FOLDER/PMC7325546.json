She was healthy at birth but admitted to the hospital frequently due to respiratory problems.\\nA physical examination showed the child had a short neck, large skull, rugged appearance, short nasal bridge, wide nose, and swollen eyelids (). Her fingers and toes were shorter than normal, and a limited movement in the distal joints due to joint stiffness. Examination of the auditory system showed there was a slight bilateral hearing loss.\\nAt first, this patient had normal vision, but after 1 year, she had glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure (right eye: 30 mm Hg; left eye: 28 mm Hg). She received an operation in 2019.\\nEchocardiography showed mitral valve prolapse at 1 year after diagnosis with MPS. In hand radiographs, the fingers and metacarpus were short, wide-, and bullet-shaped phalanges (). Paddle-shaped widened ribs and thick irregular clavicles were seen in the chest X-ray ().\\nThe results of an MS/MS assay showed arylsulfatase B at 0.03 mM/h (normal range: >3.4 assay \u00b5M/h). This result suggested an arylsulfatase B deficiency in MPS type VI.", "age": "[[4.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'26592960': 1, '16414358': 1, '30061628': 1, '30442204': 1, '23860310': 1, '30442171': 1, '24450877': 1, '22210669': 1, '30409495': 1, '27322551': 1, '28506702': 1, '31615002': 1, '24698225': 1, '30442163': 1, '31582674': 1, '27566349': 1, '20385007': 1, '21737154': 1, '27718145': 1, '26751109': 1, '28292383': 1, '22013531': 1, '24478559': 1, '31200731': 1, '28595941': 1, '29736354': 2, '3101020': 1, '28964643': 1, '30222014': 1, '25137622': 1, '15126981': 1, '30057281': 1, '32647582': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7325546-1': 2, '7325546-2': 2, '5935432-1': 1}"}
