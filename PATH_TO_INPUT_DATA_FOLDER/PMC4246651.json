MRI revealed a mass extending from the medulla oblongata to the T2 level, with an isointense T1-weighted signal and a hyperintense T2-weighted signal with a partially cystic mass. Intense heterogeneous enhancement of a solid tumor was shown following injection of Gd-DTPA (). The tumor capsule could not be clearly observed around the whole of the tumor, so a subtotal resection of the mass was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed a lesion composed of uniformly small, round cells (). Immunohistochemical staining revealed positivity for GFAP, NSE, vimentin and SYN (). Post-operative radiotherapy (56 Gy) was administered for three months and no deterioration was identified. Following radiotherapy, residual tumor was observed by MRI, however, the patient\u2019s condition had not deteriorated on a follow-up MRI performed after two years ().", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17167646': 1, '8027814': 1, '8687358': 1, '7064664': 1, '17618441': 1, '2000164': 1, '16838192': 1, '21541206': 2, '29541463': 1, '20851605': 1, '22392121': 1, '33029729': 1, '10199257': 1, '21915811': 1, '16941163': 1, '12181693': 1, '16639306': 1, '19136800': 1, '22122710': 1, '10964342': 1, '16078107': 1, '19387541': 1, '9631391': 1, '18194141': 1, '9221982': 1, '21562836': 1, '26673057': 2, '21107988': 1, '25435938': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4246651-1': 2, '4665126-1': 1, '3086174-1': 1}"}
