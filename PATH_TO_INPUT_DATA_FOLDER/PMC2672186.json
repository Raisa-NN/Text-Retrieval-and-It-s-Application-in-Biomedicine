Neurologic examinations were normal, as was a roentgenographic examination of the spine. An MRI of the lumbar spine was then performed, which clearly demonstrated a lesion of the fifth lumbar vertebra, within the confines of the vertebral cortex, having low T1- and high T2-weighted signal intensities, and showing no enhancement (). There was no evidence of soft tissue extension. In the presence of only mild trabecular sclerosis and no bone destruction as seen on computed tomography (CT), the provisional diagnosis of a GVNR was deemed most likely and the patient was subject to close follow-up with bimonthly intervals. Repeat MRI, DWI and CT, performed one year after the patient first presented with symptoms failed to demonstrate any lesion growth (). Based on the nonaggressive radiological pattern and the lack of morphological features associated with a chordoma, the patient was considered as having a GVNR and has been recommended to continue follow-up. Fourteen months after her first presentation, the patient is alive and well, and her back pain has benefited greatly from medical and physical therapy.", "age": "[[48.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22415576': 1, '10450882': 1, '3943355': 1, '8158454': 1, '11810168': 1, '29725750': 1, '16324209': 1, '21847746': 1, '14850395': 1, '28687525': 1, '29629241': 1, '12461275': 1, '3995810': 1, '12604898': 1, '22247635': 1, '11159073': 1, '19412519': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
