He had traveled on vacation to the state of Bahia, (Northeastern Brazil) Barra Grande city, on New Year's Eve 2008. After approximately one month of return, the patient reported a sudden onset of symptoms and the clinical pattern at admission to hospital included fever (39\u00b0C), fatigue, malaise, persistent and nonproductive cough, and diarrhea. The patient was examined by a physician and, after a chest radiography, the putative diagnosis at that time was pneumonia and antibiotic treatment was started at home. One week after the treatment the patient remained with continuous lassitude and diarrhea with some blood and persistent cough and was examined by other physicians that reported the same symptoms. Routine laboratory examinations were performed: complete blood count (n = 3) in alternate days for one week and one stool parasitological examination for screening intestinal parasites. The only alteration detected in the blood count was eosinophilia, which showed a gradual increase once every two days: 816, 1,232, and 1,408 cells/\u03bcL percentage corresponding to 8.0%, 14.0%, and 16.0%, respectively, of total leukocytes (normal range 0\u20137.0% or \u2264500 cells/\u03bcL). The parasitological investigation\u2014fresh stool examination\u2014revealed trophozoites of Entamoeba \\nhistolytica/Entamoeba \\ndispar. The patient was treated with secnidazole, 2,000 mg at that moment and 2,000 mg after 14 days. About two weeks after the treatment, the patient remained with the same signs and symptoms exhibited before the diagnosis of pneumonia and amebiasis and his clinical pattern worsened: very strong cough, progressing to dyspnea, generalized rash, and marked weight loss (about 8 pounds since the onset of symptoms). One week later, a new routine laboratory investigation showed leukocytosis, presence of atypical lymphocytes, normocytic-normochromic anemia, and high eosinophilia: 4,560 cells/\u03bcL\u201440.0% of total leukocytes. The patient was hospitalized and submitted to infectious diseases screening, which revealed positive serology to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis A virus (IgG-ELISA) for all viruses, data consistent with past infections. Serology for hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV types I and II, Toxoplasma gondii, and Toxocara \\ncanis was all negative. The stool parasitological examination evidenced the presence of Entamoeba coli and Endolimax \\nnana, and hemocultures were negative. After the inconclusive diagnosis and a suspicion of infection with helminths, the patient was referred to the Department of Animal Biology, Sector of Parasitology, of Biology Institute in State University of Campinas. The patient showed all the exams and was interviewed about his signs and symptoms and about information regarding travel history. Important epidemiological data and clinical pattern were obtained from that holiday: the patient had gone through a small dam to get to a beach (Taipus de Fora) rarely explored by tourists and often frequented by autochthonous population; the exposure time was approximately five minutes. The patient also recalled that he had a localized pruritic rash in both legs\u2014cercarial dermatitis\u2014after crossing the weir. Prior parasitological stool testing was negative on prior days until the one done at 70 days. The Kato-Katz method [] as well as the flotation procedure of Willis and spontaneous sedimentation method was applied in the Sector Parasitology in the State University of Campinas to search for helminthes. The coproparasitological analysis showed many Charcot Leyden crystals, and the Kato-Katz method showed the presence of Schistosoma mansoni eggs with typical lateral spine (). The quantitative analysis revealed the presence of 240 eggs per gram of stool. The patient was treated with Oxamniquine (Mansil)\u2014single dose of four tablets of 250 mg, according to the weight of the patient. The control of cure was performed for four successive months after the treatment using the Kato-Katz method to search for eggs. All stool samples were exposed to light for about 2 hours to stimulate eclosion of the miracidia. The monitoring of the control of cure to search for eggs or larvae was all negative for Schistosoma \\nmansoni, and the result of the treatment was favorable.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'17040826': 1, '12592987': 1, '20721485': 1, '16169593': 1, '15701258': 1, '8115806': 1, '15996460': 1, '6815455': 1, '9815445': 1, '17291950': 1, '18458300': 1, '16822596': 1, '11753824': 1, '17317603': 1, '23568567': 1, '2154665': 1, '22844623': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
