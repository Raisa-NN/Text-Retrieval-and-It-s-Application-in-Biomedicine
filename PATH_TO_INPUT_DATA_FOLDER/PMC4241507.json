In 2012, a routine surveillance ultrasound revealed a left adrenal mass, which on 123I-metaIodo benzyl guanidine scan showed weak uptake.\\nShe was referred to our joint endocrine-surgical service and found to have asymptomatic hypertension. There was no family history of endocrine malignancy or endocrinopathy of note. Her blood pressure in clinic was 150/99 mmHg, heart rate 86/min, BMI 31.5 kg/m2 and weight 82.5 kg.
