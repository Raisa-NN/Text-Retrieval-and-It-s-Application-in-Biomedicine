The patient had a history of hypertension, smoking, and drinking. The physical examination showed that the muscle strength of the left upper limb reached 0 grade and the muscle strength of the left lower limb reached 3 grades. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed a large number of mural thrombus in the C1 segment of the right internal carotid artery(RICA) (Fig. a). After the transcatheter thrombus aspiration and stent thrombectomy, the patient\u2019s blood vessels were recanalized, while the vessel wall of the RICA was not smooth (Fig. b). By now, the patient's symptoms have been significantly improved. Four days after operation, the three-dimensional (3D) T1 volumetric isotropic turbo spin echo acquisition (VISTA) sequence showed a high signal in the lumen of the RICA (Fig. c). Curved planner reconstruction(CPR) showed a high signal in the vessel wall of the RICA (Fig. d). The vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (VW-MRI) showed the components of hematoma in the vessel wall (Fig. a). One month after antiplatelet therapy (oral aspirin 100 mg once a day and oral clopidogrel 75 mg twice a day), VW-MRI showed the disappearance of hematoma in the vessel wall (Fig. b). So far, the patient is in good condition and is subject to regular follow-up. clopidogrel.", "age": "[[33.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'24156857': 1, '19269682': 1, '19208421': 1, '29565222': 1, '31883782': 1, '22301716': 1, '31634685': 1, '34650764': 1, '17656656': 1, '28959476': 1, '28538402': 2, '31901612': 1, '27634674': 1, '33238916': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5457882-1': 1}"}
