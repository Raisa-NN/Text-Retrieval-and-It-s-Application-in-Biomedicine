He denied any hematuria, passage of calculi, fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain. He was not on any medication.\\nOn examination, he was afebrile. Abdominal examination was normal and he had very soft right flank tenderness. Urine culture was negative.\\nRadiologic imaging including ultrasound and CT-scan showed a large right renal pelvic calculi and stones in the mid and inferior calix. It also showed upper calix hydronephrosis and thinned surrounding renal cortex (). We proposed percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) but the patient refused any percutaneous or laparoscopic surgery. He underwent open surgical procedure. The upper pole of the kidney was adherent and surrounded by fibrotic tissue. We performed pyelolithotomy. While extracting the calculi, the urine was purulent so bacteriological samples have been taken. Pelvic suture was made after we placed Double-J ureteric stent.\\nPus culture grew group D salmonella greater than 104 colony-forming units (cfu) per mL of urine. Blood culture and HIV analysis were negative. Guided by measured antimicrobial susceptibility, we prescribed third generation cephalosporin (cefotaxim 2 g3/g IV) for 14 days. The patient made a steady recovery and 16 days after admission he was discharged home.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16824609': 1, '25115408': 1, '8370950': 1, '8842280': 1, '25984372': 2, '34104703': 2, '10363147': 1, '10565958': 1, '3306260': 1, '20998830': 1, '9314485': 1, '1413301': 1, '31662942': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4423018-1': 1, '8170294-1': 1}"}
