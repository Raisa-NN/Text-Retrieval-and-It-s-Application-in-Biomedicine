It was not associated with sweating, palpitations, cough, hemoptysis, syncope, giddiness, leg pain, pedal edema, fever, rash, or any bleeding manifestations.\\nHistory of calf pain, trauma, surgery, prolonged immobilization, long-haul air travel, bleeding diathesis or any other co-morbidity was not reported by the patient. The patient also denied having any addiction history. Family history was found to be insignificant.\\nOn admission, the patient\u2019s heart rate was 114/min, and blood pressure was 106/90 mmHg. His respiratory rate was 22/min, and O\\n2 saturation rate was 82% at room air. BMI was 20.76 kg/m\\n2. There was no murmur or gallop on cardiovascular examination. Air entry was reduced in the left infra-axillary region. Also, the detailed examination (including Homan\u2019s and Moses sign) was performed and was deemed unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed tachycardia with S\\n1Q\\n3T\\n3 pattern, and chest X-ray was suggestive of obliteration of left costo-phrenic angle. The D-Dimer (17.31 ug/ml) was elevated, 34 times above the normal upper limit (0.5 ug/ml).\\nCT-Pulmonary Angiogram (\\n) was suggestive of a massive pulmonary thromboembolism. The pulmonary trunk was dilated to ~30 mm. There was a non-lumen occluding circumferential filling defect in the main pulmonary trunk, with maximum thickness of 4.5 mm. A large partial-lumen occluding filling defect was noted in the left main pulmonary artery, which was extending further into the hilar branch, occluding the lumen completely. Another larger complete lumen occluding filling defect was noted in the right main pulmonary artery. These filling defects were extending into the segmental and sub-segmental branches of the lateral segment of the right middle, lingual and bilateral lower lobe. The RV: LV ratio was 2:1. All four pulmonary veins were normal, and there was no evidence of mediastinal pathology.\\nOn admission, the patient also underwent a bilateral arteriovenous Doppler study, which was suggestive of a partially-lumen- occluding thrombus in the proximal part of left popliteal vein and a completely lumen-occluding thrombus at the left saphenopopliteal junction, approximately 14 cm long. The veins of both legs showed arterialized waveforms.\\nOn 2D echocardiography, right atrium and right ventricle was mildly dilated with grade I, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure by TR jet was 55 mmHg suggestive of moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. No regional wall motion abnormality was observed and left ventricular ejection fraction was 60%.\\nThe coagulation profile was within normal limits. All other blood investigations i.e. hemogram, serum electrolytes, renal and liver function tests were within normal range. The patient had mild hyperuricemia with serum uric acid level being 7.4 mg/dL (Normal: 3.5 \u2013 7.2 mg/dL). Cardiac enzymes (Creatine PhosphoKinase-MB and Troponin T) were mildly elevated. Trop I levels testing was not available at our centre and hence, was not done.\\nAlthough it was a clear case of massive VTE, the underlying etiology of such an event could not be extrapolated. Since the patient was a 24-year-old man, without any risk factors or comorbidities, the final diagnosis of unprovoked VTE was made.\\nThe patient was thrombolysed with Injection Alteplase infusion (100mg IV, over two hours) with Injection Enoxaparin 60 mg given subcutaneously every 12 hours. After which, the patient developed hypotension which was treated with inotropic support. Although he had tachycardia post-thrombolysis for the next two days, his blood pressure returned to normal on the third day. 48-hours after giving thrombolytic treatment, the left lower limb venous doppler was done which was suggestive of a partial-lumen occluding the thrombus in popliteal vein extending from saphenopopliteal junction to mid-leg approximately 10 cm long. The CT-pulmonary angiogram was not repeated (post-thrombolysis), due to financial constraints; however, the patient improved drastically. He was shifted to general ward on day 4 post admission. Tab Rivaroxaban 15 mg (12 hourly, orally) was prescribed for the next three weeks. The patient was discharged successfully on the 15\\nth day of admission. One week after discharge, the patient was advised Tab. Rivaroxaban 20 mg, once daily. The patient was most satisfied with the treatment and the recovery he\u2019d made, but this was not recorded in a form of any official questionnaire (but he had mentioned this verbally).\\nThe patient had followed up in our center for the first three months, following which relocated to Uttar Pradesh, India (his hometown). He experienced no side effects of Rivaroxaban. At three months of post discharge, a lower limb doppler was repeated which showed more than 50% reduction in size of the obstructing thrombus as compared to the previous one done at admission. Post three months of discharge, the patient has not returned back yet and has been lost to follow up.", "age": "[[24.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22918976': 1, '25074254': 1, '16397945': 1, '20975016': 1, '11453709': 1, '10074952': 1, '17367492': 1, '27990080': 1, '26916489': 1, '18322285': 1, '30984384': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
