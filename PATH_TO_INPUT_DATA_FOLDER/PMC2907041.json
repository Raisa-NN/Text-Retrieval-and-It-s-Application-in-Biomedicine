He gave a history of an old blunt trauma to the left eye by a football 15 years ago. The best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. The subjective refraction was \u20125.50 diopter sphere (Dsph)\u20120.75 D cylinder (cyl)\u00d7105 degrees in the right eye and \u20123.25 Dsph\u20120.50 Dcyl\u00d745 degrees in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg in both eyes. On slit-lamp examination, a pigment deposition on the endothelial side of the cornea (Krukenberg's spindle) was detected in both eyes; however, the iris examination was unremarkable. After pupillary dilatation, right eye examination revealed posterior vitreous detachment; however, lens, retina, and optic disc examinations were unremarkable. An examination of the left eye revealed a clear lens with a dense central patchy pigmentation of the posterior lens capsule []. No other signs of blunt trauma were detected on detailed examination of the anterior and posterior segments of the left eye. Gonioscopy, performed prior to pupillary dilatation, showed open angles with hyperpigmentation of the trabecular meshwork of both eyes [].", "age": "[[55.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'8981706': 1, '9150526': 1, '27638315': 1, '15967041': 2, '8570166': 1, '12107520': 1, '33213412': 2, '17972014': 1, '2333915': 1, '14646685': 1, '30254503': 2, '20534930': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'1166562-1': 1, '7678107-1': 1, '6143648-1': 1}"}
