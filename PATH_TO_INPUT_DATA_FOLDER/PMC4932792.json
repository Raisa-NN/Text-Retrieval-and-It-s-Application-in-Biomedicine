Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and hands movements in the left. Slit-lamp examination of the affected eye showed conjunctival injection, clear and compact cornea, no evidence of superficial damage to the eyeball, and no lens injury. Left eye fundus examination and fundus color retinography showed subretinal macular hemorrhage. OCT revealed full thickness macular hole and hyperreflective subretinal deposits corresponding to the submacular hemorrhage [].\\nNo intervention was done. In the follow-up visit, the visual acuity in the right eye improved from hand movement to 20/60 and the OCT showed persistent macular hole and partially absorption of the hemorrhage. Fundoscopy revealed a linear whitish lesion concentrically to the optic disc suggesting choroidal rupture. Because of the visual acuity improvement and good absorption of hemorrhage, the patient was advised to return to clinic in 3 months. Three months later, the visual acuity recovered to 20/20. OCT and fundus photographs registered complete resolution of TMH and retinal hemorrhage absorption [].", "age": "[[38.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'11508892': 1, '23514634': 1, '11320012': 1, '18202863': 1, '11812427': 1, '22259236': 1, '12485276': 1, '9497468': 1, '23258664': 1, '27433039': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
