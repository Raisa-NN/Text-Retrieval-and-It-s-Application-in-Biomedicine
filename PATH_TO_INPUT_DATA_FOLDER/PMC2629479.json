His medical history revealed no remarkable feature of a metabolic disease or hormonal derangement, trauma, sexually transmitted infection or drug abuse. Cutaneous examination showed multiple, hard, palpable, firm nodules within the scrotal skin (Figure ). Complete blood count and calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin and 25-OH vitamin D levels were normal. The lesions were locally excised from the affected part of the scrotal wall and the patient was well after 2-year follow-up and no recurrence was seen during the follow-up period.\\nExcised specimens were 1.5 to 2.5 cm in size. On histological examination, the nodules were composed of basophilic calcified material and located in the dermis while foreign giant cells and fibrosis were present adjacent to the atrophic stratified squamous epithelium. There was no epithelial lining around the calcified nodules (Figure ).\\nImmunohistochemically, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was negative while cytokeratin was positive on the surface of the epithelial lining of the scrotum.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'7149755': 1, '15280824': 1, '2462577': 1, '21935341': 1, '452234': 1, '17414441': 1, '11167697': 1, '31929936': 1, '11182365': 1, '11932225': 1, '9700381': 1, '12174071': 1, '5464321': 1, '19063719': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
