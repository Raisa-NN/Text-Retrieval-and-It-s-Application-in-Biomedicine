He last opened bowels or passed flatus 2 days ago. No History of shortness of breath, coffee-ground vomit or melena. His past history included ischemic heart disease and diverticular disease.\\nOn assessment, he was hypertensive, normal heart rate and temperatures. Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Laboratory tests were all within normal range. CT Abdomen showed distal esophageal mural thickening suggestive of esophagitis in small hiatus hernia with bilateral pleural effusions (Fig. ).\\nHe was commenced on high-dose PPI, IV Antibiotics and analgesia. Emergency gastroscopy showed middle third of esophagus consistent with esophagitis and circumferential ischemia/necrosis in distal esophagus 27\u201334 cm (Fig. ). Mucosal biopsies taken revealed ulcerated squamocolumnar mucosa with necrosis and inflammation. No CMV inclusions were identified.\\nNasojejunostomy tube was inserted and feeds were commenced. Interval gastroscopy in 2weeks revealed superficial sloughing of esophagus from 27 to 34 cm consistent with partial thickness esophageal necrosis (Fig. ). Clear fluids were commenced and gradually upgraded to full diet over the course of 6 weeks. Follow-up gastroscopy at 9 weeks showed completely healed mucosa (Fig. ).", "age": "[[82.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25297468': 1, '10202074': 1, '20614476': 1, '24996722': 1, '10805856': 1, '2295407': 1, '17322991': 1, '31695996': 2, '19800431': 1, '19139686': 1, '30555673': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6290383-1': 2, '6820666-1': 1}"}
