He was in follow-up and had no previous PET scan, known clinical history, or co-morbidities. One hour after FDG injection PET/CT images were obtained from the whole body. A primary lesion with intense uptake was detected in the right upper lobe of the lung and lymphadenopathy with increased FDG uptake in the right paratracheal lymphatic region in the mediastinum. Additionally, multiple focal FDG uptake was detected in the liver parenchyma, which was compatible with known hepatic metastasis. Furthermore, increased FDG uptake was detected in skin and subcutaneous fat tissue in both axillary, periscrotal, and perianal regions suspicious for metastasic disease (Figure ).\\nPatient was questioned about the skin lesions after the scan was performed. On physical examination, erythematous nodular lesions were detected especially in the axillary region with serous and purulent discharge (Figure ). Biopsy was done subsequently and the histopathology report was compatible with chronic inflammation. On clinical examination, the patient had hidradenitis suppurativa.", "age": "[[54.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'5030236': 1, '12516847': 1, '16775238': 1, '1952719': 1, '25221681': 2, '17515511': 1, '14756891': 1, '19624979': 1, '21750134': 1, '29166335': 1, '20657126': 1, '26050949': 1, '20083598': 1, '10354171': 1, '31427907': 1, '24251266': 1, '31595571': 1, '12890458': 1, '33409018': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4158253-1': 1}"}
