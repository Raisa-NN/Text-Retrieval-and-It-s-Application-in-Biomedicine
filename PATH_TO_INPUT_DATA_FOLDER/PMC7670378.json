Apart from the chief complaint, numerous dark-brownish keratotic follicular papules were noticed at the entire back without being concerned by the patient (Fig. ). He reported that the lesions at the back developed since his teenage years without any symptoms. None of his family members had similar lesions. He denied waxing, scrubbing, or applying any topical medications. The dermoscopic examination demonstrated a bundle of short, multiple hairs surrounded by a keratinous sheath in a dilated follicle (Fig. ).\\nSkin biopsy was performed at a representative area, which revealed follicular hyperkeratosis with dilated infundibulum containing a group of vellus hair shafts (Fig. ). Based on the history, clinical presentation, and histopathological findings, the diagnosis was consistent with TS. His treatment comprised twice-daily 10% urea cream applied on the lesions, and mild improvement was shown at a 4-week follow-up visit.", "age": "[[57.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'22639880': 1, '27601861': 2, '29440853': 1, '25748313': 1, '9863280': 1, '19778356': 1, '16309493': 1, '21173334': 1, '31544095': 1, '27127371': 2, '25593806': 1, '4269703': 1, '25368477': 2, '12390185': 1, '10916698': 1, '30410899': 1, '30566542': 1, '25054768': 1, '21842223': 1, '33250734': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4989392-1': 1, '4830167-1': 1, '4212297-1': 1}"}
