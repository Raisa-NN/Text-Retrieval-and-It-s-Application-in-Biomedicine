On examination, BCVA was 20/20 OU. Both upper eyelids showed a well defined mass with irregular surface in the tarsal area. It was fixed to the tarsus and hard in consistency. On upper lid eversion, conjunctiva was involved on left side and overlying skin was normal [Figures and ]. It was associated with severe ptosis bilaterally. The remainder of the anterior and posterior segment examination was normal. Strong clinical suspicion of chronic granulomatous disorder was considered. The chest X-ray, complete blood count, tuberculin test, serum ANA titres, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) were normal. An incision biopsy of the swelling on the left side was initially performed. Peroperative, an irregular pinkish coloured mass was present involving the tarsus and levator muscle. On histopathology this mass showed the characteristic features of light chain associated amyloidosis [Figures and ] with meibomian gland atrophy. Investigations for systemic amyloidosis as mentioned above were normal and similar histopathological features were seen on biopsy of the right side.", "age": "[[35.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8154264': 1, '2477780': 1, '15121386': 1, '30320104': 1, '9535640': 1, '6154243': 1, '26466598': 1, '16828514': 1, '17646744': 1, '6990257': 1, '23248550': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3519135-1': 2}"}
