On physical examination of her AVF, she was found to have changes on palpation and auscultation of her AVF suggestive of a venous outflow stenosis. A fistulogram confirmed a venous outflow stenosis. Successful angioplasty of the stenosis followed. A few months later she complained of persistent pain at the fistula site. Physical exam demonstrated a hard marble like structure within the AVF. Dialysis was attempted unsuccessfully. A repeat fistulogram indicated persistent stenosis mid-humerus (Figure a) and was treated with angioplasty. A follow up ultrasound a week later showed residual clot (Figure b). She underwent four tPA infusions in the dialysis unit, on four separate days. Decrease of clot burden was evident on a repeat ultrasound (Figure c). On physical assessment, the marble like structure was absent and persistent pain resolved. Successful dialysis treatments were initiated. First access flow was 970 ml/min after initiation of dialysis. She underwent a repeat angioplasty for a stenosis 2 months later.", "age": "[[73.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'21147293': 1, '9314374': 1, '10551242': 1, '12753691': 1, '28083553': 1, '3851652': 1, '28270920': 1, '1824582': 1, '11287506': 1, '12171980': 1, '11585881': 1, '25780625': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4349238-1': 2}"}
