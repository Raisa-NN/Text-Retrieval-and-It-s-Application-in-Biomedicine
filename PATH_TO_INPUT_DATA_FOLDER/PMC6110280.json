Examination revealed 2/5 strength on the left side\\nand 4/5 on the right. CK was 28,885 U/L; necrotizing myositis was suspected.\\nPatient was treated with IV methylprednisolone followed by PDN 60 mg/day.\\nExtensive proximal muscle edema was seen on MRI. Vastus medialis biopsy showed\\nnecrotizing features without inflammation. Hydroxy-Methyl-Glutaryl Coenzyme A\\nreductase (HMG CoA) antibodies were strongly positive. One month after\\npresentation, there was a modest improvement in motor weakness; CK had dropped\\nto 5,546 U/L. IVIG (5 days) was given and MMF 1 g/day were started. Patient\\ncontinued to experience weakness and CK remained elevated. Two months after\\npresentation, rituximab was added to the regimen of MMF (3 g/day) and prednisone\\n(60 mg/day). Two doses of IVIG were given as a bridge therapy. After an initial\\nresponse, the patient\u2019s muscle weakness returned. Three months after\\npresentation, CK remained elevated (3,178 U/L). TAC 4 mg/day was added to MMF (3\\ng/day) and PDN 40 mg/day. On follow up visits, TAC dose was increased to 6\\nmg/day and PDN was tapered slowly. Eight months after TAC was initiated,\\nweakness improved markedly and labs normalized (CK 117 U/L, LDH 251 U/L). One\\nyear after tacrolimus and MMF, the physical exam was normal with full strength\\nthroughout. PDN had been reduced to 5 mg daily ().", "age": "[[51.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23124935': 1, '16157605': 1, '17881720': 1, '20536595': 1, '28052609': 1, '10579116': 1, '18716733': 1, '16822917': 1, '21376512': 1, '16227154': 1, '16357462': 1, '10440399': 1, '21694936': 1, '12697731': 1, '17543149': 1, '28763333': 1, '16251851': 1, '16582685': 1, '25923553': 1, '9402690': 1, '8632081': 1, '10878285': 1, '22955021': 1, '16583368': 1, '28970719': 1, '26633102': 1, '23173570': 1, '22870489': 1, '23970542': 1, '10347992': 1, '11294511': 1, '16052580': 1, '22886003': 1, '10755536': 1, '17003173': 1, '19433436': 1, '16636243': 1, '22141281': 1, '1714235': 1, '14511932': 1, '12510664': 1, '30159206': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6110280-1': 2, '6110280-2': 2}"}
