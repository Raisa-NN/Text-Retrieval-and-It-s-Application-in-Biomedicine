The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 25 years ago and had been receiving haemodialysis for the last 10 years. She was diagnosed with uraemic pleuropericarditis just 1 month ago and had been receiving intensive haemodialysis at our hospital (high-flux dialyser: FMC F60S and the surface area: 1.3 m2, blood flow rate: 250 mL/min, dialysate flow rate: 500 mL/min, HD duration and frequency; for 4 h four times a week, no heparin use).\\nOn admission, her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg, pulse rate was 110/min and body temperature was 37.9\u00b0C. Physical examination of her chest revealed decreased breathing sound on both lower lung fields. A simple chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly, and loss of both costophrenic angles and echocardiography revealed a large amount of pericardial effusion. Laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count of 10 730/mm3, the haemoglobin concentration of 9.3 g/dL, the platelet count of 161 000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 43.0 mg/dL and serum creatinine of 6.1 mg/dL. The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 6.08 mg/dL and the serum albumin level was 4.1 g/dL. No pathogenic bacteria were isolated from her sputum and blood cultures. Serologic tests revealed the absence of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis A, B and C virus. The anti-nuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody were all absent.\\nUpon thoracentesis, a haemorrhagic lymphocyte-predominant exudate was retrieved, and cytologic examination, bacterial culture and acid-fast staining all revealed negative findings. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) was slightly increased (75 IU/L) in pleural effusion. There was no significant difference between the findings of pleural and pericardial effusion.\\nWe diagnosed her as having recurrent uraemic pleuropericarditis and started treatment with on-line haemodiafiltration for 4 h each for four to six times a week without using heparin (dialyser: FMC F60S and the surface area: 1.3 m2, blood flow rate: 250 ml/min, dialysate flow rate: 500 ml/min, substitution dialysate flow rate: 180 ml/min).\\nDespite of administration of antibiotics and NSAIDs, no significant improvement was observed. She required repeated thoracentesis and pericardiocentesis for relief of symptoms, and the CRP level was as high as 30.50 mg/dL on the 58th hospital day.\\nA pleural biopsy was performed and thick fibrinous pleuritis was identified without evidence of infection or malignancy. After that, we administered prednisolone 40 mg/dL (1 mg/kg/day) orally. The patient's symptoms had abated by 1 week after the start of prednisolone therapy, and pleural and pericardial effusion had decreased (Figure ). We maintained prednisolone at its initial dose for 36 days and tapered it by 10 mg a week. On the 71st hospital day, she was discharged without any symptoms, and the CRP level had decreased to 2.08 mg/dL (Figure ).", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17524841': 1, '7634886': 1, '16629230': 1, '19000551': 1, '15120056': 1, '1235331': 1, '30997062': 1, '25949383': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
