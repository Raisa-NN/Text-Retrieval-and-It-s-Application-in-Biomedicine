She had intermittent abdominal pain. She had two loose bowel movements daily without any blood or mucus. She lost 20 pounds of weight during this time. She had been on a gluten free diet for 3 months with partial improvement. She was on omeprazole 20 mg for heartburn for 6 months. On examination, she had mild epigastric tenderness. CBC was normal except for a mild increase in the lymphocyte count. Antigliadin antibody IgG was elevated. Anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA was normal but total IgA level was low. Due to the abnormal serology for celiac disease and irregular bowel habits, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy was done. EGD suggested gastritis and duodenitis. Colonoscopy was normal. The gastric biopsy showed significant thickening of sub-epithelial collagen () and chronic inflammation consistent with collagenous gastritis. The duodenal biopsy showed preservation of villous architecture with mildly increased intraepithelial lymphocytic inflammation consistent with focal mild lymphocytic duodenitis (). As she was already on omeprazole with a gluten free diet, a follow-up visit in 3 months was planned. She reported partial improvement in her symptoms after 3 months. Her abdominal pain resolved but she still reported three loose bowel movements per day.", "age": "[[26.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'25952808': 1, '30255340': 1, '26184019': 1, '25789098': 1, '25871617': 1, '21346601': 1, '34123443': 2, '28496534': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8172285-1': 1}"}
