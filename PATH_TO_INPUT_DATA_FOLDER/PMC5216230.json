Endosonographically, a 5-mm hypoechoic lesion was observed in the pancreatic tail. It was a round-shaped, well-defined, homogeneous pancreatic mass with identical echogenicity to the spleen (Fig ). The remaining pancreas was unremarkable. After the administration of sonographic contrast (SonoVue\u00ae; Bracco, Milano, Italy), the lesion showed a uniform hyperenhancing appearance compared with the surrounding pancreas (Fig ). The lesion characterization was complemented by EUS-elastography, which displayed a homogeneous, green elastographic pattern (Fig ). These features together were highly suggestive of a benign pancreatic solid lesion such as an IPAS or a benign neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Interposition of the splenic artery between the probe and the lesion precluded EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Therefore, a definite pathological diagnosis was not possible to achieve, and the patient was scheduled for a second EUS within 6 months to re-evaluate the pancreatic lesion.", "age": "[[69.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'18335556': 1, '33203069': 1, '31417068': 1, '31549337': 1, '16273945': 1, '27155592': 1, '20600020': 1, '19266611': 1, '23558433': 1, '13670140': 1, '27034814': 1, '22072251': 1, '26602569': 1, '27144203': 1, '23657300': 1, '21590615': 1, '20196663': 1, '32566751': 2, '19647248': 1, '28100996': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7297644-1': 1}"}
