The patient was treated for seven weeks using VR sessions and Fairburn\u2019s CBTC protocol [] for BN. The VR software consisted of a kitchen with two areas that contained elements to cook, drink and eat. The patient could access the foods freely or block them if desired. She could also perform alternative behaviors in the virtual environment (for example, making a phone call). At the end of the treatment, the patient showed a reduction in BE, purges and food avoidance. In addition, after VR exposure, the patient showed an overall improvement, such as a decrease in drive for thinness, bulimia measures and in general psychopathology. The authors concluded that VR was an effective complement to CBT treatment in this bulimic patient.", "age": "[[17.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'22770364': 1, '34093303': 1, '30702436': 1, '17544252': 1, '28325167': 1, '25658103': 1, '32612410': 1, '31116851': 1, '15295149': 1, '26799891': 1, '20218785': 1, '21685646': 1, '24834042': 1, '14671735': 1, '34909015': 1, '26430819': 1, '32533799': 1, '23759286': 1, '32812889': 1, '33847593': 1, '32324145': 1, '22119329': 1, '26882323': 1, '12855080': 1, '26781985': 1, '17034316': 1, '26799896': 1, '11070440': 1, '15667047': 1, '20950176': 1, '11308436': 1, '20602749': 1, '12381039': 1, '26094134': 1, '19822737': 1, '22387716': 1, '30510422': 1, '24391763': 1, '23201859': 1, '19493540': 1, '2891736': 1, '27095333': 1, '31696674': 1, '22644309': 1, '26795129': 1, '23452907': 1, '32918448': 1, '10168930': 1, '21341345': 1, '26651521': 1, '23993280': 1, '19178251': 1, '24123463': 1, '34505369': 1, '23499231': 1, '33049341': 1, '33916374': 1, '27746747': 1, '30183347': 1, '28698483': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
