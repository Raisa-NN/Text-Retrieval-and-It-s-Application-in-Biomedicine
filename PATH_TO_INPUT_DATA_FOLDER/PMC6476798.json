Abdominal CT scan demonstrated evidence of duodenal diverticulitis and she was started on broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (). Overnight, her clinical condition had worsened with persistent tachycardia, increase in white count, fevers and signs of peritonitis on exam. Interval CT revealed significant amount of air and fluid in the abdomen concerning for free perforation. Patient was consented for exploration and possible pancreatoduodenectomy. During surgery, large perforation of the 4 cm juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum originating from posterior-medial wall with peritonitis was found (). Due to very medial location in close proximity to insertion of the ampulla, segmental resection was not possible and decision was made to proceed with pancreatoduodenectomy. Pathology confirmed perforation originating from duodenal diverticulum with no additional abnormal findings. Patient tolerated procedure without complications and was discharged home after 10-day hospital stay. She is doing well at 2 months follow up and has returned to work.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'33688446': 2, '34164722': 1, '23810155': 1, '32454453': 1, '34722030': 2, '30214324': 2, '32514821': 2, '22392090': 1, '30342279': 1, '17320524': 1, '18521693': 1, '31005047': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7914078-1': 1, '7914078-2': 1, '7914078-3': 1, '8544636-1': 1, '7280391-1': 1, '6121776-1': 1}"}
