He also had a history of tuberculosis 10 years previously with resultant lung destruction.\\nPhysical examination revealed coarse crackles over the left lung. Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 13,500/\u00b5L with 80.3% neutrophils, 9.2% lymphocytes, and 6.6% monocytes; other findings were within normal limits.\\nA chest radiograph showed a large opacity over the left hilum with an air bronchogram surrounding a crescentic air lucency. Reticulation with multiple cystic formations was observed over the left lower lobe, and extensive pleural thickening was present (). Chest computed tomography showed a mass within a cavity, producing a ball-in-hole appearance, over the left upper lung lobe ().\\nThe patient underwent bronchoalveolar lavage with normal saline, and fungal culture of the lavage fluid yielded Trichophyton. Three rounds of acid-fast staining were performed, but the results were negative. About 2 months later in the outpatient department, tuberculosis culture yielded no tuberculosis pathogen growth. After 6 months of treatment with oral itraconazole at 200 mg daily, the patient\u2019s productive cough and shortness of breath were gradually ameliorated, the coarse crackles were reduced, and the onychomycosis of his toes resolved.", "age": "[[65.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'26872588': 1, '26131186': 1, '26738840': 1, '28837657': 1, '4745258': 1, '25816316': 1, '27483367': 1, '11451835': 1, '24266334': 1, '21881144': 1, '12065367': 1, '25144462': 1, '34936512': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
