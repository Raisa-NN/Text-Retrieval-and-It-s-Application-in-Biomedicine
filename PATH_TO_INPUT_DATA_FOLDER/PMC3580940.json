A former computerized tomography (CT) was consistent with a vesicourachal diverticle on the anterior wall of the urinary bladder (). Physical examination was unremarkable except for a previous cesarean scar and suprapubic tenderness. A chest X-ray was normal. She was scheduled to undergo cystoscopy and appropriate intervention. Preoperative routines were sent. Urine examination showed 10 erythrocytes. Cystoscopy under the epidural anesthesia revealed no pathology on the roof of the bladder, except for an urachal ostium and mucus. A partial cystectomy operation was planned. By an incision from the previous Pfannenstiel incision, partial cystectomy, en bloc resection of the urachus, and excision of the parietal peritoneum were performed (). After a 62-minute operation, the patient was hospitalized for 3 days. The urinary catheter was removed after 7 days. Histopathology of the partial cystectomy material revealed urachal adenocarcinoma with intact surgical borders (). She was followed up with 3-month-interval cystoscopies.", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'6794339': 1, '17639381': 1, '17880303': 1, '5027455': 1, '30314491': 2, '12629346': 1, '1887535': 1, '1527402': 1, '20945591': 1, '17932892': 1, '11259707': 1, '23476880': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6186105-1': 1}"}
