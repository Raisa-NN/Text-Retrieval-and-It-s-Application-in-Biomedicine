She developed a low-grade fever (38.2 \u00b0C) on Day 14 after receiving a second dose of JE vaccination. After taking medicine, she was fine until Day 17. She had a fever again (38.8 \u00b0C), and cried and vomited for three days. Psychiatric symptoms, including delusional features and talking nonsense, became apparent on Day 27. A blood test, abdominal ultrasonography, X-ray examination, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormalities, but the urinary tract was infected. IVIG was administrated. On Day 30, she was drooling in opisthotonus posturing and had an upward gaze and neck stiffness. Then she was transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU), and succumbed to unconsciousness and involuntary movements in the ICU. Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was confirmed by the detection of anti-NMDAR antibodies in CSF.", "age": "[[2.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'20554777': 1, '31293459': 1, '25603816': 1, '27171078': 1, '31749755': 2, '32731413': 1, '23876001': 1, '25889446': 1, '11526378': 1, '23731466': 1, '26819305': 1, '23073777': 1, '33255227': 1, '34903200': 2, '26709797': 1, '24115338': 1, '12612250': 1, '24846064': 1, '10615080': 1, '192928': 1, '23290630': 1, '26683768': 1, '22452878': 1, '31590348': 1, '34014156': 1, '24522920': 1, '26984403': 1, '24756070': 1, '24473671': 1, '11224510': 1, '27631202': 1, '34360568': 1, '20878418': 1, '18475044': 1, '33959091': 1, '23343627': 1, '34803896': 1, '25819538': 1, '32174851': 1, '21163445': 1, '1349810': 1, '24275495': 1, '26937036': 1, '10210877': 1, '27213352': 1, '17413852': 1, '28106787': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6848057-1': 1, '8666465-1': 1}"}
