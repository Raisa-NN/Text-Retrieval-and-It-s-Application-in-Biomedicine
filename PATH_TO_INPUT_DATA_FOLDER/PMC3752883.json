The transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a large mass measuring 1.4 \u00d7 1.4 cm in the left atrium that could represent a thrombus or myxoma []. The patient was asymptomatic and his past medical history was unremarkable except for hypertension. Clinical and laboratory examinations demonstrated no abnormality. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest and heart with intravenous contrast did not show any cardiac tumor. TEE was then done and it showed a giant IASA bulging into the left atrium and mimicking a left atrial mass []. The patient had not had stroke or other cardio embolic phenomenon; therefore no further interventions were undertaken other than starting aspirin.", "age": "[[41.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'9813752': 1, '17041713': 1, '15078999': 1, '4067118': 1, '15743569': 1, '1629640': 1, '7758185': 1, '9555164': 1, '17515346': 1, '21859651': 1, '8910184': 1, '23983915': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
