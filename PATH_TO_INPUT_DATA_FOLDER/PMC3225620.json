The physician who initially examined the child gave a provisional diagnosis of elbow sprain, having found no fracture line on anteroposterior (Fig. ) and lateral radiographs. The elbow was immobilized in 90\u00b0 flexion and neutral position for 2 weeks with long-arm splint, and then active elbow motion was encouraged. Despite physiotherapy, ROM did not improve and partial stiffness persisted. Progression of cubitus varus deformity was noted, and the boy reported constant pain during elbow motion.\\nThe patient was referred to our hospital 4 months after the initial injury. Clinical examination showed a cubitus varus deformity with decreased Baumann angle (3\u00b0) and restricted ROM: extension lag 45\u00b0; flexion 110\u00b0; arc of motion 65\u00b0. There were neither neurologic nor circulatory deficits. An anteroposterior radiograph showed a very thin sliver of ossification quite distant from the bony trochlea, slight narrowing of the humeroulnar joint, and Baumann angle 5\u00b0 (Fig. a). Magnetic resonance imaging showed complete rotation of the cartilaginous fragment, with a trochlear defect (Fig. b). We decided to reduce the fracture using the open method after obtaining consent from the boy\u2019s parents. An incision was made directly over the displaced sliver fragment. Intraoperatively, we found the intramedullary cancellous fracture surface facing laterally outward just under the subcutaneous fatty tissue (Fig. ). The ulnar nerve was identified and protected with an elastic rubber drain. The proximal fragment was freshened with thorough curettage of the defect where the displaced distal fragment was located previously and had become filled with fibrotic tissue. We identified the medial margin of the articular cartilage and medullary space of the host bone, and reduction of the rotated fragment was accomplished without takedown of the attached flexor muscles. However, the fracture could not be reduced anatomically because the fracture surface and shape had already changed due to time elapsed since injury. We reduced the fragment in the most plausible position primarily with approximation of articular margin, fixed it with three smooth Kirschner (K) wires (Fig. ), then repaired the soft tissue with absorbable synthetic suture material. A long-arm cast was applied with the elbow at 90\u00b0 and the forearm in neutral position for 6 weeks. We removed the K wires 6 weeks after surgery under local anesthesia.\\nImmediately after surgery, ulnar nerve palsy was noted, which recovered completely by 8 weeks after surgery with simple observation. At the 6-month follow-up, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the cartilaginous trochlea was united and well positioned (Fig. ).\\nAt 3 years 2 months follow-up, an anteroposterior radiograph showed an irregular, spiculated, bony trochlea and a normal Baumann angle (15\u00b0) (Fig. ). Examination showed an improved ROM, with an extension lag of 10\u00b0 and flexion to 140\u00b0; arc of motion was 130\u00b0. We obtained permission from the patient\u2019s parents and approval from our institutional review board (Log No. 10\u201389).", "age": "[[7.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'5092799': 1, '3611338': 1, '5832737': 1, '6073191': 1, '3734065': 1, '32744828': 1, '5469199': 1, '4030866': 1, '30167417': 2, '7430203': 1, '23934502': 1, '29484463': 1, '11744844': 1, '21879318': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6114207-1': 1}"}
