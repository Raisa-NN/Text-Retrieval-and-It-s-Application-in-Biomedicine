The patient was a non-smoker, initially visited her primary care physician with a chief complaint of a chronic cough that did not respond to antibiotic therapy. On October 12, 2007, a chest CT scan was performed which demonstrated a left lower lobe mass, as well as a left pleural effusion, and a liver mass. On October 18, 2007, thoracentesis demonstrated evidence of malignant cells. Approximately two liters of fluid was removed. A PET scan performed on October 22, 2007 showed diffuse hypermetabolic uptake in the left upper chest wall, liver, left femur, and left lower lung. A repeat CT scan on October 25, 2007 demonstrated re-accumulation of the pleural fluid. A mass within the right lobe of the liver and lower lung was also evident. The patient was referred to an oncologist.\\nOn November 1, 2007, as a part of the examination, the medical oncologist detected an abnormal mass located on the left posterior buccal keratinized tissue adjacent to tooth number 34, 35. No lymphadenopathy was detected. On the same day, the patient was referred to the Periodontics division, Department of Dental Specialties, Mayo Clinic.\\nAn intraoral examination revealed an erythematous growth located on the facial and lingual interdental papillae of the teeth numbering 33 and 34 [] and 34 and 35 []. The probing depths throughout the mouth were within normal limits and the patient denied a recent history of trauma. The lesion measured approximately 10 mm in diameter buccal to tooth number 34 and 7 mm in diameter on buccal to tooth number 35. On palpation, the lesion was firm and painless. In addition, lingual papilla interproximal to tooth number 34 and 35 appeared erythematous and edematous. An excisional biopsy was performed on the buccal interdental gingiva of tooth number 34 and 35 and submitted for histologic examination.\\nImmunohistochemical stains were performed for CK7, CK20, TTF-1 and p63. Histologic section of the adenocarcinoma showed squamous mucosa on top with infiltrating sub mucosal tumor. Some tumor cells nests involve sub mucosal lymphatic spaces. The tumor cells were positive for CK7 and TTF-1, weakly positive for p63 and negative for CK20 [Figures and ]. These results support the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.", "age": "[[72.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'8746264': 1, '14064805': 1, '13691275': 1, '15209637': 1, '5260657': 1, '18113569': 1, '15405683': 1, '1064724': 1, '14342927': 1, '23248480': 2, '20376244': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3519223-1': 1}"}
