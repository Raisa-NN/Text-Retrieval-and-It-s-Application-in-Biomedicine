The pregnant woman was 160 cm tall and weighed 53 kg with normal hallmark developmental milestones. She delivered a boy 10 years ago. During the second trimester maternal serum screening in another hospital, she was notified that the foetus had an increased risk of developing T18 syndrome. The study participant was at 16 weeks\u2019 gestation. As is routine practice, an ultrasound was conducted to monitor the developmental status of the foetus. The ultrasound examination at a gestational age of 16 weeks showed that the foetus was normal. To avoid invasive prenatal diagnosis procedures, an NIPT was offered to further screen for common foetal chromosomal abnormalities. This project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Ganzhou Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all of the participants or guardians that participated in this research.", "age": "[[32.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'2227929': 1, '1733164': 1, '33094427': 1, '10422808': 1, '9634536': 1, '25830323': 1, '34187576': 2, '25028595': 2, '2884621': 1, '4704858': 1, '17006048': 1, '26462918': 1, '25099589': 1, '738725': 1, '22214468': 1, '26554006': 1, '21482375': 1, '24387276': 2, '24596125': 1, '25747126': 1, '1458223': 1, '24466384': 1, '4537614': 1, '30666717': 1, '27493408': 1, '27098336': 1, '25585704': 1, '11514393': 1, '19490791': 1, '8488568': 1, '29946361': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8243479-1': 1, '3905963-1': 1, '4099144-1': 1}"}
