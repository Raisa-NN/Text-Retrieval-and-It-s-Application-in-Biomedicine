Physical examination revealed a 1\u00d71.5-cm hard, non-tender, non-movable mass. Motion of the distal interphalangeal joint was normal. Plain radiographs of the finger revealed a calcifying soft tissue mass associated with large cortical scalloping on the volar ulnar side of the distal phalanx (). The distal interphalangeal joint was normal in appearance. On the high-resolution ultrasound (US) exam (HDI5000, Philips Medical System, Bothell, WA) with a high-frequency (15-7 MHz) compact linear transducer, a heterogeneously hyper-echoic mass with surface lobulation and extrinsic cortical erosion by the mass was clearly observable (). The vascularity of the mass was not detected on color Doppler US (). Surgery revealed a flesh-colored lobulated mass was firmly attached to the periosteum of the distal phalanx and eroded it. However, the mass could be excised without any resection of the bone. Microscopic sections revealed a spindle-cell neoplasm with scattered calcifications and chondroid differentiation (). A pathologic diagnosis of calcifying aponeurotic fibroma was made. During the last nine months, the patient has been well with no signs of recurrence.", "age": "[[36.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'3584255': 1, '5483662': 1, '11353108': 1, '11885385': 1, '860041': 1, '16843166': 1, '29243144': 1, '11315790': 1, '30728691': 1, '22363857': 2, '14689252': 1, '25901261': 2, '18253083': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4393499-1': 1, '3262540-1': 1}"}
