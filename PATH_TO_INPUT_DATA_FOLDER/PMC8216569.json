She presented with multiple SCCs on the bilateral lower legs for a surgical consultation, as shown in Figure . Initiating treatment with cryotherapy and chemowraps was preferred by the patient as opposed to surgery. Weekly treatment of cryotherapy with subsequent application of 5-FU and an Unna boot for eight consecutive weeks on the bilateral lower legs was performed. Notable improvement of the lesions on the lower extremities was seen bilaterally, with only ulceration remaining, as shown in Figure . Biopsies of multiple sites confirmed no remaining SCCs. She was then referred to plastic surgery for skin grafting of the ulcers.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23651243': 1, '1564155': 1, '30497667': 1, '22805044': 1, '26304846': 1, '18664163': 1, '31000135': 1, '24210370': 1, '34178485': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8216569-1': 2, '8216569-2': 2, '8216569-3': 2}"}
