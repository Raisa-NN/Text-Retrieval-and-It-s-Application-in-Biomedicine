Ultrasonography suggested extensive ascites in the abdomen. Uterus and ovaries were not observed. The dermatology clinic was consulted about the verrucous lesions found in the genital examination of the patient (), and skin biopsy was performed to confirm the prediagnosis of lymphangioma circumscriptum. Histopathology revealed large, irregular cystic dilatation of lymphatic channels consisting predominantly endothelial lining. These channels contain proteinaceous fluid and red cells in the upper dermis and lift up against the covering epidermis (). For the purpose of exploring the etiology of the ascites, examinations were conducted on the patient whose history revealed that she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salphingo-oophorectomy 7 years ago. Peritoneal biopsy was taken from the patient to rule out malignancies. Peritoneal biopsy could not rule out tuberculosis, and the patient was considered to have a chronic inflammatory event. Ascites treatment was planned for the patient, and she was referred to the dermatologic surgery. This patient also rejected the surgery treatment. But, she has been visiting the clinic regularly for follow-up purposes since then.", "age": "[[60.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'17917576': 1, '21496698': 1, '31700851': 2, '12218845': 1, '3351067': 1, '14761137': 1, '10235381': 1, '9723056': 1, '20653826': 1, '24396614': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3876770-1': 2, '6827547-1': 1}"}
