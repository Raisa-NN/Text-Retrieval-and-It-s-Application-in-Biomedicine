Visual acuity was 20/60 with no metamorphopsia. He underwent a standard three-port 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with sequential ICG-assisted ERM and ILM peeling, in the same fashion as described above. This patient also received 2 mg of triamcinolone at the end of the case. At the 1-month postoperative visit, we noted a similar fan-shaped pigmentary alteration that was evident on infrared imaging (). In the areas of outer retinal disturbances, SD-OCT showed focal discontinuities of the external limiting membrane, outer nuclear layer, and ellipsoid zone, as well as underlying RPE mottling (), which had improved on the 4-month postoperative visit (). Fundus photography and autofluorescence (AF) were obtained on the final visit, which showed scattered foci of mixed hyper-and hypo-AF (). Final visual acuity improved to 20/30, with no scotoma.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'1524116': 1, '27574394': 1, '15059697': 1, '9639443': 1, '25280900': 1, '17581700': 1, '31007247': 1, '24392911': 1, '1454342': 1, '17891024': 1, '33647472': 1, '18689696': 1, '31258694': 1, '18185133': 1, '6477253': 1, '12766079': 1, '1985488': 1, '23743638': 1, '418686': 1, '21178995': 1, '20335621': 1, '13129864': 1, '15774920': 1, '7269268': 1, '15069433': 1, '23033383': 1, '25525328': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4266418-1': 2}"}
