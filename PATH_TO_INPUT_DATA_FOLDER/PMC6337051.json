It was associated with thoracic tightness and productive cough, without hemoptysis or fever. Perinatal history was unremarkable, and no history of similar symptoms was found in any of her siblings. Neither ongoing treatment nor smoking habits were reported. Clinical exam revealed decreased breath sounds to the right pulmonary base with dullness to percussion and diminished vocal fremitus on the right side. Pulse oximetry was 100%, and neither tachycardia nor tachypnea were noticed. Plain chest radiography showed absence of inflated right lung with mediastinal shift towards the same side (Figure ). Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated complete atelectasis of the right lung with short-blind right main bronchus and compensatory hyperinflation of the left lung; proposed diagnosis was congenital bronchopulmonary malformation (pulmonary hypoplasia) (Figures and ). Lung function tests confirmed restrictive lung disease, with FEV reaching 40% of the predicted value and FVC 43%. Bronchoscopy revealed a fibrotic scar area on the right side of the trachea with dimple at the place of opening of right main bronchus.", "age": "[[18.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'12376599': 1, '30671565': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
