His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in V1-5. After thrombolytic therapy using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, stent implantation was performed from the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) to the mid LAD using 3.0\u00d727 mm bare-metal stent (BMS) as an elective percutaneous coronary intervention ().\\nOne year later, recurrent chest pain developed and an ECG showed ST-segment elevations in V1-5. Coronary angiography (CAG) revealed type IV (total) ISR in the proximal LAD, which was treated with balloon angioplasty using a 3.0\u00d720 mm balloon (the first ISR). One year after that, recurrent chest pain developed, and ECG showed no ST-T changes, but CAG revealed type II (diffuse) ISR. This second ISR was treated with brachytherapy with a Rhenium filled balloon (300 seconds at 6 atm using a 3.0\u00d720 mm balloon) ().\\nFour months later, recurrent chest pain developed once again and an ECG showed ST-segment elevations in V1-4. CAG revealed type IV ISR secondary to brachytherapy failure, which was treated with 3.0\u00d720 mm balloon and 3.0\u00d718 mm BMS implantation distal to the previously implanted BMS (the third ISR) (). Three months later, chest pain recurred and ECG showed ST-segment elevations in V3-5. CAG revealed type II ISR, which was treated with only ballooning (the fourth ISR). Nine months later, recurrent chest pain developed, and ECG showed no ST-T changes. CAG revealed type II ISR in the proximal and mid LAD stent. A 3.0\u00d733 mm Cypher stent\u00ae (Cordis Johnson & Johnson, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) was implanted to treat this fifth ISR presentation (). The patient then remained asymptomatic and the 5-year follow-up CAG showed no ISR ().", "age": "[[51.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'16750678': 1, '8041413': 1, '12196334': 1, '16781233': 1, '15644543': 1, '16531618': 1, '10779453': 1, '8041414': 1, '11137830': 1, '17515458': 1, '10880407': 1, '14760331': 1, '12590904': 1, '22194765': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
