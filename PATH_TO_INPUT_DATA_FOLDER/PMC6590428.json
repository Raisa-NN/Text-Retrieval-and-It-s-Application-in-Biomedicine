He noticed increasing scaling and thickening of skin with loss of hair on scalp and face. The patient had a history of atopic dermatitis since childhood. In 1979, he was diagnosed with psoriasis and has had erythroderma for >25 years. Numerous therapies failed, including topical steroids of various strengths, cyclosporine, and multiple clinical trials, including a TNF inhibitor, and an oral JAK 1/2 inhibitor for presumed psoriasis. He reported severe pruritus unresponsive to antihistamines. S\u00e9zary cell count was 4,607/\u03bcL, and a TCR clone was identified in the skin and blood. He was diagnosed with stage IVA SS.\\nHe is currently on cycle 12 of romidepsin 14 mg/m2 qw 3/4. He initially developed mild thrombocytopenia, which resolved. Fatigue, mild gastrointestinal symptoms (upset stomach, nausea), and loss of appetite usually resolved within 2 to 4 days. His skin is less thickened with minimal erythema (Figure ); hyperkeratotic plaques on the soles and hands resolved, with only focal fine fissuring on palms noted; peripheral lymphadenopathy decreased in size. At last visit, S\u00e9zary cell count was negative; he is in partial to near complete remission. His pruritus improved significantly, with one mild flare per week, mostly localized, without need for anti-itch medication.", "age": "[[67.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25762519': 1, '24335103': 1, '22948508': 1, '34446710': 1, '22839723': 1, '27001482': 1, '23698099': 1, '25894580': 1, '22285672': 1, '19674465': 1, '30549384': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6590428-1': 2, '6590428-2': 2, '6590428-3': 2}"}
