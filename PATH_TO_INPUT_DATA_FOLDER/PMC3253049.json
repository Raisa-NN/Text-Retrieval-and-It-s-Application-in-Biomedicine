Her past medical history included coronary artery bypass grafting, hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2.\\nShe was deemed too high risk for conventional surgery and therefore underwent transapical approach TAVI with the implantation of a 23 mm Edwards Scientific Sapien XT valve prosthesis (a bovine tissue valve inserted on a cobalt chromium frame). Immediate transoephageal echocardiography and fluoroscopic imaging demonstrated excellent seating of the valve, subsequently confirmed angiographically.\\nTwo days later the patient developed isolated electrocardiographic evidence of pericarditis with minimal associated chest pain. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a well seated aortic prosthesis and a 0.8 cm pericardial effusion with no tamponade. The effusion was not drained and her electrocardiographic changes settled over the next few days. Three months later, transthoracic echocardiography showed an abnormal bidirectional signal at the apex (Additional File ). Peak velocity was 139.4 cm-1. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) showed a discrete pseudoaneurysm with late gadolinium myocardial enhancement (Additional Files and ). The decision was made to treat her conservatively and keep her under regular surveillance.", "age": "[[86.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23334841': 2, '19110790': 1, '20566953': 1, '19559200': 1, '20096533': 1, '24006874': 1, '23158097': 1, '21073523': 1, '12473543': 1, '24092466': 1, '22152296': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3825576-1': 1}"}
