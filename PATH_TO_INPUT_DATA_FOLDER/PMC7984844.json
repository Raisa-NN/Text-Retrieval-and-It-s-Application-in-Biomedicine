Physical examination revealed a mass at the right inguinal area without any further abnormalities. No laboratory tests or imaging were obtained. An inguinal hernia was the tentative diagnosis. Due to the intake of oral anticoagulation, the surgery was delayed even further.\\nUnder general anaesthesia, a transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) was the procedure of choice. During the diagnostic laparoscopy, a femoral hernia with the appendix entering the femoral canal was detected (). The appendix showed no signs of inflammation or ischemia, but had adhesions to the peritoneum in the femoral sac. The hernia was repaired using a synthetic mesh; due to the lack of inflammation an appendectomy was not performed. The patient\u2019s post-operative course was uneventful, and oral food intake was initiated on the first post-operative day. No unexpected events occurred, and the patient was discharged 48 h after the surgery.", "age": "[[71.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'23093709': 1, '22983696': 1, '28070438': 2, '33227689': 1, '21718485': 2, '16044937': 1, '19225856': 1, '2766144': 1, '30536122': 2, '24426642': 1, '31605980': 1, '17001453': 1, '16351463': 1, '14997930': 1, '33777353': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3141709-1': 1, '6394699-1': 1, '6394699-2': 1, '5192293-1': 1, '5192293-2': 1}"}
