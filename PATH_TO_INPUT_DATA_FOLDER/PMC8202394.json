Her other developmental markers were normal. The patient was American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) B neurology at the time of admission. Examination revealed nontender kyphotic deformity in the thoracolumbar region, with no neurocutaneous markers and congenital limb abnormalities. X-ray revealed an angular kyphotic deformity with apex at D11 vertebra [].\\nThe segmental kyphosis was 60\u00b0 and the scoliotic Cobbs angle was 9\u00b0 and a negative sagittal balance. Operative intervention was planned in view of the neurological deficit. Vertebral column resection (VCR) at D10 level and pedicle screw fixation from D7 to D12 was done []. Postsurgery course was uneventful, and the patient's neurology improved to ASIA D and was ambulating independently. One year after index surgery, the patient presented with PJK. She opted-out of a surgical intervention and at the present follow-up of 6 years is wheelchair bound with ASIA C neurology. Radiographs at the latest follow-up show a progressive increase in angular kyphosis []. The segmental kyphosis has increased to 81\u00b0; the mesh cage has backed out with a broken rod on the right side.", "age": "[[14.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'25835484': 1, '25271516': 1, '27651858': 1, '26661847': 1, '28437340': 1, '28603565': 1, '23536051': 1, '16688022': 1, '19644326': 1, '23921319': 1, '15990669': 1, '22234705': 1, '28264237': 1, '3357687': 1, '20889912': 1, '13413387': 1, '27196453': 1, '28187070': 1, '24053377': 1, '34211876': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'8202394-1': 2, '8202394-2': 2}"}
