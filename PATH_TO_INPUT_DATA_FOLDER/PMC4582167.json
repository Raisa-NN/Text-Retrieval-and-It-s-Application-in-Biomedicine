He was born after an uncomplicated and a full term pregnancy. Birth weight was 3,250 g, but there was no data about head circumference at birth. Family history was unremarkable; the parents were fourth degree consanguineous. On admission, weight and height values (8,000 g and 68 cm, respectively) were at the normal percentile. His head circumference was 40 cm (<3rd percentile). His head control was poor and he was not able to sit with support. He was hypertonic and deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive. He was conscious, but he was not able to follow visual and aural stimuli. Other neurologic and systemic examinations were normal. In laboratory examination, complete blood count, serum biochemical and urine analysis, thyroid functions were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography was normal. The fifth wave was not detected in auditory brainstem response test. Karyotype analysis was normal (46, XY). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed absence of the lateral and third ventricles. The thalami were fused and the corpus callosum was absent. The interhemispheric fissure and falx cerebri were formed (, ). There was abnormal oriented sulcus at the vertex on the left (). The posterior fossa and fourth ventricle were normal. The orbital MRI was also normal. All radiological features were suggestive of holoprosencephaly with no identifiable lateral or third ventricle.", "age": "[[6.0, 'month']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'7567274': 1, '16546387': 1, '8456724': 1, '8896616': 1, '33009835': 1, '9840665': 1, '10598051': 1, '8826753': 1, '26417484': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
