He had blunt trauma to the chest (with right hemothorax) and abdomen (with right lower lobe liver laceration) with fractured right tibia.\\nOn admission patient had Injury severity scoring (ISS)[] of 26, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 12 and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score of 18 which indicated that patient would need intensive critical care. A CECT of the chest and abdomen revealed right hemothorax and right lower lobe liver laceration. His renal parameters were deranged on admission with coagulopathy. During his stay in ICU, the patient progressively became oliguric and was anuric by third ICU day. He developed sepsis with multiorgan failure (respiratory failure, renal failure, and metabolic disturbance). He required intubation and ventilator support on sixth day of his ICU stay in view of respiratory distress. Trend of laboratory parameters is shown in . He received heparin-free dialysis on third, fourth, and sixth days in view of coagulopathy. However, no blood products were transfused as there was no active bleeding. On the sixth day, patients GCS decreased from 15 to 6. A noncontrast computed tomography head [] revealed massive hemorrhage in parieto-occipital region with intraventricular extension. Surgical intervention was planned once coagulation profile was corrected. Patient expired within 6 h.", "age": "[[40.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'4814394': 1, '15460551': 1, '18661407': 1, '15198728': 1, '22164456': 1, '25885629': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
