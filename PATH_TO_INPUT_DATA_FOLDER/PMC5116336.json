His vital findings were stable with no prominent finding in his physical examination. Emergent coronary angiography was performed for primary percutaneous intervention of the culprit artery. However, LAD artery was totally occluded in the proximal segment just after a huge 32 \u00d7 26 mm sized aneurysm (). Then, emergent CABG operation was planned and performed in 75 minutes because of multivessel disease including the RCA and left circumflex artery. Aneurysm was ligated and coronary bypass was performed using LIMA and saphenous grafts. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. He was discharged with medical therapy including ASA, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. He was asymptomatic at his polyclinic visit in the third month.", "age": "[[70.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'3880989': 1, '31383682': 2, '15355840': 1, '11078300': 1, '31363429': 2, '14025069': 1, '27891151': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'6685413-1': 1, '6663276-1': 1}"}
