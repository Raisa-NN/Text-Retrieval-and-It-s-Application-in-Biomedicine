Visual acuities were 6/6 (20/20) in both eyes. Slit lamp examination revealed right eye injection, multiple hairs at all levels of the cornea with associated opacities, and a moderate anterior uveitis (). Hair-like vitreous lesions and peripheral full-thickness retinal infiltrates were also evident (). Left eye examination was normal. After further questioning, it transpired that the boy had a pet Chilean Rose Tarantula spider, thus providing the diagnosis. Topical treatment was commenced with G. Dexamethasone 0.1% qds and G. Chloramphenicol 0.5% qds; he was followed monthly and continued on a long-term tapering regimen of topical steroid. Removal of hairs was felt to be inappropriate in view of the large number of hairs, the deep site of many, and the inability of the patient to tolerate this without general anaesthetic.\\nAt 18-month follow-up both eyes were white and quite with acuities of 6/6 with a successful wean off topical treatment. The corneal hairs had not migrated and were still present in all corneal layers, whilst the retinal lesions were now inactive and less numerous. During this period no complications such as cataract, raised intraocular pressure, macular oedema, or visual loss were observed.", "age": "[[9.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10810943': 1, '12724714': 1, '11594994': 1, '34583330': 1, '22125534': 1, '10832706': 1, '23212648': 1, '22222718': 1, '9183200': 1, '20029643': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
