The patient denied any previous history of scrotal injury or irritative urinary symptoms. Physical examination revealed normal penile structure with bilateral descended testicles, a palpable right intratesticular mass, and no lymphadenopathy in the groin region. Ultrasound showed evidence of a hypoechoic 1.4 cm \u00d7 1.3 cm intratesticular mass []. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the scrotum confirmed the presence of an enhancing 1.4 cm intratesticular mass []. Considering malignancy, the right inguinal partial orchiectomy through right inguinal incision and frozen section was performed which revealed no evidence of malignancy. The specimen was a 1.5 cm \u00d7 1.4 cm \u00d7 0.9 cm oval cyst with tan-gray smooth surface with wall thickness <0.1 cm. As a result, the right testicle was preserved. Final pathology showed a benign cyst with fibrosis and dystrophic calcification with abundant necrotic debris and no viable epithelial lining and confirmed the diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst with no atypical or malignant features identified [].", "age": "[[43.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'25659561': 2, '5372025': 1, '855070': 1, '7226006': 1, '13710851': 1, '8199834': 1, '23853187': 1, '18495173': 1, '26331129': 2, '4179964': 1, '13184583': 1, '28794603': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'4550594-1': 1, '4955498-1': 1}"}
