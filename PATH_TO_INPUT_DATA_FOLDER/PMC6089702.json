However, for a better dosing schedule, liraglutide was subsequently discontinued and a recently improved medication, albiglutide, was added. The following day, post the administration of her first dose, the patient reported a swelling of her lower extremities, which progressed over the next two days to involve the face and upper extremities. She also had a weight gain of five pounds. There was no other possible explanation of generalized edema and the patient did not have cardiac, liver, or renal disease. There were also no recent changes in her medications. Her physical examination was remarkable for generalized edema and periorbital puffiness. There was no stridor and her lungs were clear to auscultation. The further physical examination was unremarkable. Important laboratory investigations are given in Table .\\nAll the blood tests listed in the above table are normal. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), and ultrasonography of her abdomen were all unremarkable. Due to a cause-and-effect relationship, it was presumed that her generalized edema could be due to a possible side effect of albiglutide. Consequently, albiglutide was discontinued, which led to the resolution of her generalized edema, thereby confirming albiglutide as the causative agent. Liraglutide was then resumed and our patient remained symptom-free.", "age": "[[35.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19592625': 1, '26577795': 1, '18812476': 1, '28284167': 1, '26276240': 1, '28678550': 1, '30116680': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
