Currently, he did not have any cardiac symptoms. On enquiring, he gave history of some non-specific chest discomfort six months back which resolved without any treatment and he never consulted any doctor. He had no history of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking or familial heart disease.\\nPhysical examination was unremarkable. ECG revealed pathological q waves with inverted T waves in inferior leads [], suggestive of old inferior wall myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests were normal including cardiac biomarkers. Echocardiography revealed hypokinetic mid and apical inferior wall with left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%.\\nWe proceeded for coronary angiography in view of abnormal ECG and echo findings.\\nSurprisingly, his coronary angiography showed type 1 spontaneous dissection of all three major coronary arteries including LAD [], LCX [] and RCA [], although there was distal TIMI 3 flow without any holding of contrast.[]", "age": "[[45.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'27417009': 1, '20843252': 1, '25774346': 1, '29481627': 1, '30354594': 1, '25929580': 1, '20959599': 1, '8673763': 1, '17106495': 1, '31803682': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
