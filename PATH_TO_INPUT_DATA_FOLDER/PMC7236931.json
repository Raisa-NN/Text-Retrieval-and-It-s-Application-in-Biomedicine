Cytology showed no signs of malignancy and at follow-up 2 months later the pericardial effusion was resolved spontaneously. Unfortunately, it recurred in December 2017. At this time, a tumor was found in the right atrium (Fig. ) and radical surgery (R0) was performed. Histopathology showed an angiosarcoma. No metastases were found. Adjuvant radiotherapy (33 \u00d7 1.8 Gy) was added until March 2018, without complications. Based on the young age and high risk of recurrence and metastases, it was decided to add 6 cycles of paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 days 1\u20138-15 q28 days. One year after, evaluation showed local recurrence together with pulmonary metastases. The patient is still alive.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19464464': 1, '34859182': 2, '33743733': 2, '21545935': 1, '9209944': 1, '21924626': 1, '3578017': 1, '19018680': 1, '24452054': 1, '23424592': 2, '6537794': 1, '17650338': 2, '23389377': 1, '15811617': 1, '19304772': 1, '17043434': 2, '25108492': 1, '19779791': 1, '23312835': 1, '34317634': 1, '34356838': 1, '1728367': 1, '33790766': 2, '25928192': 1, '32430055': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'7236931-1': 2, '1976316-1': 1, '1976316-2': 1, '3568891-1': 1, '7983626-1': 1, '7981869-1': 1, '2722010-1': 1, '8633751-1': 1}"}
