On physical examination, swelling and tenderness over the calcaneocuboid joint were detected. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the right ankle showed a suspicious fracture line on the anterior process of the calcaneus and what appeared to be a bone fragment between the calcaneus and the cuboideum. Comparative consideration of the contralateral ankle based on plain radiographs did not demonstrate any similar findings, only a fracture line on anterior aspect of the right talus could suspiciously be determined (). An advanced radiologic examination was then performed, consisting of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the right ankle with axial (), multiplanar (), and three-dimensional (3D) volume rendering (). The CT images revealed a smoothly and sharply marginated well-corticated bone fragment in the subtalar region. With these findings, a diagnosis of os calcaneus secundarius was made. The patient was treated with the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the symptoms were evidently relieved within the following 10 days. Finally, he was free of pain during the mobilization after 30 days.", "age": "[[20.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'10195492': 1, '11694427': 1, '3066225': 1, '9786334': 1, '15018183': 1, '16399555': 1, '31563970': 1, '34833396': 1, '23715845': 1, '31363861': 1, '8037009': 1, '19661780': 1, '33888108': 1, '25610694': 2}", "similar_patients": "{}"}
