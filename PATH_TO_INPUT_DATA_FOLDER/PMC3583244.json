The CBV map, acquired after the first dose of bevacizumab, shows rapid growth of the necrotic area, that has completely replaced the hypervascularized region documented by the baseline CBV map. This is displayed in more detail by the nCBV histograms, showing a significant decrease in the hyper-perfused regions but, contemporary, a marked increase in the hypo-perfused sub-volumes inside the VOI, in particular V=0 increases by 425% with respect to the baseline value. These abnormal CBV areas seem to be predictive of the subsequent changes in contrast enhancement, as documented by the post-Gd T1-weighted images acquired before (Figure c) and at 10 weeks from the onset of treatment (Figure d). The patient was defined as progressive and died two months after the MRI scan.", "age": "[[50.0, 'year']]", "gender": "M", "relevant_articles": "{'19114704': 1, '21321221': 1, '21263101': 1, '25322816': 1, '26220640': 1, '20413772': 1, '25383376': 1, '26364181': 1, '21808202': 1, '26872471': 1, '21286939': 1, '15934498': 1, '17947719': 1, '21324937': 1, '24442487': 1, '20644085': 1, '28036021': 1, '28819189': 1, '21125399': 1, '19549889': 1, '21586505': 1, '20231676': 1, '15758009': 1, '21343498': 1, '28536391': 1, '31325144': 1, '25713439': 1, '27998280': 1, '25543124': 1, '21890539': 1, '26017379': 1, '30361791': 1, '26137087': 1, '18810326': 1, '27398030': 1, '11780887': 1, '22494770': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'3583244-1': 2}"}
