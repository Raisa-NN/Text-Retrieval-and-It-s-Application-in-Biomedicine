A transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated an enlarged uterus, dilated varicose vessels throughout the myometrium with vascular structures extending to the vagina. MRI and CT scans confirmed vaginal involvement as well as enhancing left renal and right adrenal lesions, and multiple nodules in the lung bases were identified. The lung lesions measured up to 14 mm and some were in close proximity to the pulmonary veins concerning for vascular invasion. A brain MRI was unremarkable and a fluoroscopy-guided lumbar puncture was negative for malignant cells. The hCG levels of the spinal fluid were within the normal range; 3 IU/L (CSF/Serum ratio < 1:60). A PET/CT confirmed the aforementioned lesions albeit without significant FDG activity. A biopsy of the vaginal tumor was consistent with PSTT.\\nIn an attempt to reduce the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage from high burden of disease the patient initially received treatment with low dose etoposide (E) 100 mg/m2 and cisplatin (P) 20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2, repeated every week for 3 weeks. Five weeks after initiation of low dose EP the hCG level stabilized at 1138 from 1114 mIU/mL. Given the significant tumor burden in the uterus, the decision was made to proceed with cytoreductive surgery with hysterectomy. Preoperative imaging confirmed there was significant collateral vascularity involving the primary tumor. The patient underwent bilateral uterine artery embolization in order to reduce risk of hemorrhage prior to the planned surgery which included an exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and excision of the vaginal tumor. Postoperatively the hCG level decreased to 472 mIU/mL.\\nGross surgical pathology revealed tumor infiltrating the entire uterine wall to the serosal surface with parametrial margin involvement, anterior vaginal wall involvement and lymphovascular space involvement (). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis (A) shows tumor cells with large pleomorphic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. There was scattered expression of HCG (B) and diffuse positive staining for GATA3 (C). Ki67 staining (D) revealed a mildly increased proliferation index of 15\u201320%. There was no expression of p63 (E). PD-L1 was found to be highly expressed (90% (in house mAB) and 100% using the Tumor Proportion Score (TPS; Dako 22C3 pharmDx\u2122) (F).\\nPost operatively the EP/EMA (etoposide, cisplatin/etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D) regimen was initiated intravenously: day 1 cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and etoposide 150 mg/m2, day 8 actinomycin D 0.5 mg, day 10 etoposide 100 mg/m2 and methotrexate 300 mg/m2. With completion of 5 cycles of EP/EMA, the hCG had decreased from 472 to 55 mIU/mL.\\nAfter cycle 5, the patient developed left sided upper abdominal pain and a follow up PET/CT demonstrated bilateral pulmonary nodules, some increased and some decreased since the prior exam. In addition, a splenic vein thrombosis with splenic infarct involving the middle and lower pole of the spleen was noticed for which she was started on anticoagulation with apixaban. Two weeks after completion of cycle 5 she developed chills and fever (38.5 \u00b0C). Blood cultures revealed methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus (MSSA) bacteremia thought to be secondary to port-a-cath infection. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a 2.5 cm right atrial mass (thrombus versus vegetation) as well as a patent foramen ovale. An MRI of the brain revealed multiple embolic infarcts. On additional review of the imaging by interventional radiology (IR), it was determined the patient had multiple pulmonary arterial pseudo-aneurysms with arteriovenous shunting. These correlated with the sites of previous lung nodules and were thought to be the result of vascular trauma due to regression of prior PSTT metastases.\\nIn order to mitigate the risk of paradoxical embolus as well as pulmonary hemorrhage, she underwent transarterial embolization of these pulmonary shunts. A large arterial aneurysm within the right lower lobe of the lung as well as a large right lower lobe arteriovenous fistula with associated aneurysm were successfully treated with coil embolization (). The patient was bridged from intravenous heparin to apixaban on discharge and completed a four-week course of intravenous oxacillin. An interval MRI performed 1 month later revealed resolution of right atrial thrombus, and improvement in cystic lung disease, with a newly identified small pseudoaneurysm in the left lower lobe. The patient again underwent successful IR coil embolization of this lesion with subsequent resolution.\\nGiven the high PD-L1 expression of the tumor as well as the presence of TILs (40% and 10% positive CD4 and CD8 cells, respectively) the decision was made to add pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks starting with cycle 6. At the time of the third pembrolizumab infusion, the patient\u2019s hCG level became undetectable. Chemotherapy with EP/EMA in addition to pembrolizumab was continued for an additional 2 months thereafter as consolidative therapy before transitioning to maintenance pembrolizumab (). The patient experienced several toxicities secondary to chemotherapy including thrombocytopenia as well as ototoxicity and tinnitus that was confirmed with formal audiological evaluation. This prompted the substitution of carboplatin for cisplatin with cycle 10 in the hopes of minimizing further adverse events.\\nSeveral days after the patient\u2019s second infusion of pembrolizumab the patient developed symptomatic palpitations with heart rates elevated to the 130\u2013140 range. Thyroid function tests (TFTs) were significantly elevated with a free T4 of 1.3 ng/dL, TSH of 8.2 mIU/mL, free T3 of 122 pg/dL, and total T3 of 36 ng/dL most consistent with inflammatory thyroiditis secondary to pembrolizumab. The patient required administration of methimazole and beta blockade followed by thyroid supplementation with resolution of TFT abnormalities as well as symptoms. The patient completed a total of 10 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with an end of treatment PET/CT demonstrating continued treatment response with an undetectable HCG level. The patient remains on pembrolizumab and disease free 7 months since completion of chemotherapy.\\nTo enable appropriate counseling on the future prognosis, genetic analysis was performed to determine the causative pregnancy. DNA from tumor specimens, maternal and paternal tissue (blood), as well as child (saliva) was evaluated for 24 short tandem repeat loci as previously described at the Gestational Trophoblastic Disease Service at the Imperial College Hospital in London, UK (). Because all of the informative paternal alleles present in the tumor were also present in the female child born 8 months prior to the PSTT diagnosis, the antecedent pregnancy was found to be the source of the tumor.", "age": "[[34.0, 'year']]", "gender": "F", "relevant_articles": "{'19552948': 1, '27362903': 1, '31047719': 1, '28878648': 2, '29185430': 1, '28742453': 1, '32964090': 1, '32716740': 1, '30792530': 1, '27246306': 1, '34036138': 2}", "similar_patients": "{'5582528-1': 1}"}
